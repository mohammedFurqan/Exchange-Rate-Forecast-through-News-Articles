The officials said the South Africans had no immediate reaction to the potential appointment of Robert J. Brown, a move described by officials as part of the Administration's effort to suggest a change in the tone of its policy toward Pretoria.   Administration officials had no comment on disclosures that shortly after leaving the Nixon White House, where he was a special assistant, Mr. Brown became a partner in a company that received a Government contract without bidding through a program designed to aid disadvantaged minorities. Mr. Brown, who is now is a public relations executive in North Carolina, could not be reached for comment today.   At a 1977 hearing, Senator Lawton Chiles used the case of Mr. Brown as one of several examples of what he termed abuses in the Small Business Administration's 8(a) program for encouraging minority businesses. The program provided no bid Federal contracts to minority businesses."

The most dramatic change expected in the bill -and the one likely to have the most effect on divorce settlements - is the sharp drop in the top tax bracket. But other parts of the tax bill, including the new personal exemptions and the changed treatment of capital gains, will also affect divorce settlements.   Tax experts and matrimonial lawyers say the new bill will make husbands less willing to pay their ex-wives alimony and more inclined to agree to larger property settlements instead - a development that may not be in the wives' best interest."

Hours later, it turned around, sped north and left in its wake a mystery of conspiracy and corruption that has kept Peruvians entertained ever since.   Officials here said that Peru's President, Alan Garcia, had been tipped off by the Central Intelligence Agency that the ship, the Pia Vesta, was carrying contraband Soviet-bloc weapons for possible delivery to terrorist groups, and that when the vessel arrived at the port of Balboa on June 14, President Garcia asked Panamanian authorities to seize it.   But while inspection confirmed that its cargo had indeed been loaded in East Germany and comprised 32 trucks, 1,500 AK-47 automatic rifles and 1,500 antitank rockets of Soviet design, its owner seemed to be a Miami-based American arms dealer and its buyers anything but leftist guerrillas."

It also involved suspense up to the last moment as to whether the magazine might be harmed in mailboxes or crumpled in readers' pockets.   The ad, the centerfold in a five-page insert, cost $3 million, or 35 percent of the entire 1986 advertising budget of Transamerica, an insurance and financial-service company based in San Francisco. This compares with an ordinary double-page, four-color ad's costing about $229,000 plus $10,000 for color separation."

Mr. Gorbachev's remark, made on a provincial tour, was his first public comment on the case of Nicholas S.

But for the most part that frustrating artifact of the early 1980's has been retired to the attic, the garbage heap, and, with a bow to its elegance and ingeniousness, to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.   But Erno Rubik, the soft-spoken Hungarian architecture professor whose name it bears, is not one to fade from sight. He is about to mark his return with a puzzle that, if anything, is more difficult to solve than the once-ubiquitous cube, which during a three-year run generated sales that have been estimated at 100 million authorized copies, 50 million unauthorized ''knockoffs,'' and at least 10 million books explaining how it could be solved. The enterprise also netted millions of dollars for the Hungarian economy and its entrepreneurial son, Mr. Rubik.   The cube contained 26 smaller cubes in six bright colors that rotated on horizontal and verticle axes. The trick, as thousands of purchasers remember with despair, was to unscramble the smaller cubes so that they gave the larger cube six walls of solid colors. Mathemeticians figured that the cube could be arranged in 43 quintillion positions, or, more precisely, 43,252,003,274,489,856,000."

One is the problem faced by the democratic opposition over its relations with the Communist Party and the militant left, which, along with the military and the police, are blamed for turning what was supposed to be a peaceful protest into a nightmare for many Chileans.   The other problem is what is widely perceived as the absence of a strong leader within the opposition forces, coupled with a more precise statement of the basis for a future government and the steps in a transition.   General Pinochet touched an opposition nerve on the point about violence when he asserted Friday, the day after the 48-hour strike ended, that the protest and other protests against him had united ''those who call themselves democrats with the anti-democrats and the terrorists.''"

Aquino of the Philippines to a joint meeting of Congress today:   My predecessor set aside democracy to save it from a Communist insurgency that numbered less than 500. Unhampered by respect for human rights, he went at it with hammer and tongs. By the time he fled, that insurgency had grown to more than 16,000. I think there is a lesson here to be learned about trying to stifle a thing with the means by which it grows."

Economists as well as the markets are expecting the figures to show an anemic 1 percent to 1.5 percent annual rate of expansion in the economy during the April to June period. But interpretations differ as to what that weakness signifies for economic growth and hence for the Fed's intentions.   ''I don't see the Fed rushing to implement easier monetary policy, but I don't think it can wait until the end of the year,'' said Norman Robertson, the chief economist for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. ''Another month of these listless economic statistics and I think you'll have a cut in the discount rate by Labor Day.''"

Interest rates, including the prime rate used by banks to set rates for loans to most medium-sized and small corporate borrowers will fall,the analysts say, in response to the Federal Reserve's decision last week to again lower its discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to financial institutions.   But with factories working at roughly 78 percent of capacity and with the effects of the proposed tax changes uncertain, they say, a drop in rates alone will hardly matter when it comes to business executives' decisions to invest in new plants and equipment.   Indeed, executives have repeatedly revised downward their spending plans even as rates have dropped steadily this year. Last fall, for instance, executives told the Commerce Department that they planned to increase spending by 2.4 percent in 1986 over 1985. By last spring, the figure had slipped to 2.3 percent, and in June respondents were predicting a rise of only two-tenths of 1 percent. By comparison, spending rose 9 percent in 1985 and 16.3 percent in 1984."

The corporations then used the funds to fuel scores of ventures completely unrelated to the employees on whose behalf the plan was established.   Why would Exxon and other major corporations embark on such raids? The Doonesbury cartoon strip caught the spirit of the trend when a character remarked: ''The pension fund was just sitting there.''   Pension plan reversions, as this piracy is called, are a relatively new phenomenon. Only in the past six years have companies dared to use their pension plans as corporate piggy banks. Before that employers felt bound by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which states that money in pension funds must be used exclusively for the benefit of workers and retirees so long as the plan is in operation.

Many rules concerning vacation homes are likely to be tightened, to the extent that, in the view of some tax advisers, it could make economic sense to act now to get under the current, more generous measures. If owners are contemplating selling, experts say, they should sell now to benefit from more generous capital gains treatment. Alternatively, would-be home-buyers might consider buying sooner than planned, to lock in more liberal tax breaks.   Some tax experts have even more draconian advice. Although Congress ''has come out fairly liberal on vacation homes, get into the deal only if you expect to see a lot of appreciation,'' cautioned Lawrence W.

After painful negotiations, the United Steelworkers of America reluctantly agreed to as much as $1.8 billion in concessions.   This year, with the industry in even more woeful shape, the companies have come back for more. But while the union's strength has weakened along with that of the companies, the steelworkers, under a new president, Lynn R. Williams, are struggling this time around to get something in return.   Still willing to grant concessions, the union is demanding that the companies open their books to prove ''dire'' need, and provide stock, profit sharing or other compensation for any new givebacks. And it contends that new cuts are only part of the solution, stressing the need for other kinds of company efficiencies and for greater protection against imports."

But even without the oil factor, economists have been worrying about inflationary pressures. Most responding to a recent survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, of Sedona, Ariz., said it was their top economic concern. On average, they see the Consumer Price Index rising at higher annual rates - up to 3.9 percent in second-quarter 1987, compared with 1.5 percent in this year's second quarter.   Victor Zarnowitz, a University of Chicago economist, is less worried, but agrees that inflation is likely to rise. A rise in food prices and in the cost of services - especially health services - he says, may put the C.P.I.'s annual growth rate at 2.6 percent this quarter and at 3.4 percent by the fourth quarter."

With the fervor of evangelists, brokers and investment bankers talk of the complex financial needs of America's millions of well-to-do households and the sophisticated financial products and services they offer.   The strategy has been spurred by Wall Street's realization that the number of people with hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years.

Paley and Laurence A. Tisch, seemed to be acting quite independently of each other. The 84-year-old Mr. Paley, once again chairman of the company he founded 58 years ago, sat smiling at the boardroom table of fine English walnut. He was clearly tired but his jacket was still on and he looked crisp and ready for action.   Mr. Tisch, the 63-year-old chairman of the $6.7 billion Loews Corporation and now CBS's new chief executive, was already on the move. His jacket was also in place, and he sat outside the board room, intently talking on the telephone.   But appearances aside, the two men actually have evolved an intricate balance of power in the 10 months since Mr. Tisch joined the CBS board. Together, Mr. Tisch and Mr. Paley and their friends control more than 34 percent of CBS's stock, and this week their newly forged alliance proved powerful enough to unseat Thomas H. Wyman as CBS chairman and chief executive. Mr. Paley became acting chairman and Mr. Tisch acting chief executive until a successor to Mr. Wyman can be found. Mr. Paley will concentrate almost exclusively on programming, while Mr. Tisch will tend to the company's management and fiscal health."

In this way, collective efforts produce a picture of present-day international realities. How do we see that picture today? At first glance, the period since the previous session of the General Assembly has not added bright colors to the panorama of our time. It has been marked by a number of factors which have aggravated old concerns. The arms race has not been halted; it is going ahead in a steep spiral. The danger of the arms race spreading to outer space has become more real. Dangerous hotbeds of armed conflict persist. Misery and poverty in many parts of the world are becoming more acute.   All this being so, we nevertheless believe that the International Year of Peace will go down in history with something more than just its symbols of peace."

Their interrogator was merciless: He grilled them about security on a top-secret project, believed to be the new Stealth fighter plane. He took them painstakingly through every detail of how documents are accounted for at Lockheed, and how it could happen that hundreds of papers appeared to be missing.   When they did not know the answers, Larry Kitchen sent them away to find out. When the weekend came, he continued to hold court in the conference room, quizzing employees until he understood Lockheed's security arrangements better than any other senior executive. Then he arranged what he called a ''murder board'' in which Lockheed executives mimicked a Congressional panel and goaded him with hostile questions.   So Lawrence O. Kitchen, the new chairman and chief executive of the Lockheed Corporation, was ready when he went to Washington in late July to explain what a Pentagon official called a ''near disaster'': the company's inability to account for 1,400 documents related to the Stealth program, a project so secret that officially it does not even exist."

''Ed took out a second  [ mortgage ]  on his house, wrote to Harvard for an M.B.A., and now we're preparing to enter the wine-cooler business,'' intoned Frank in the first of a series of more than 30 commercials that always end with him humbly thanking the viewers for their support.   But don't let commercials fool you. Frank and Ed are fictional characters portrayed by novice actors. The two people really behind Bartles & Jaymes are not innocent rubes, but two of the shrewdest, most aggressive, most secretive and most feared men in the wine business - Ernest and Julio Gallo.   And with one-year old Bartles & Jaymes, the Gallo brothers have stormed into first place in the booming wine cooler business, one of the few bright spots in an industry suffering from flat sales. That coup, which reversed a two-year decline in sales for Gallo, was only the latest of the remarkable string of successes that allowed the E.&J. Gallo winery to grow from a shed in the Great Depression into the world's largest winery. And the cooler's success has left its stunned competitors gaping in awe."

Although he repeated President Reagan's opposition to efforts in Congress to impose economic sanctions, Mr. Shultz, apparently in an effort to delay such moves, introduced the possibility for the first time of joint American-European sanctions in September. He said the Administration wanted the flexibility to increase pressure in coordination with its allies as the situation evolved.

Usually the crunch is short-lived - but for some, red ink becomes a way of life.   When debt becomes too much to handle alone, a professional counselor can help. A credit union may be able to refer members to one. Another source of help is a nonprofit organization called the National Foundation for Consumer Credit. The foundation acts as an umbrella for 256 affiliated agencies around the country, most of them operating under the Consumer Credit Counseling Service name. (Do not confuse these agencies with expensive credit clinics that promise to repair poor credit histories.) The C.C.C.S. agencies provide counseling services free, and if a client undertakes a formal debt-repayment program, some groups impose a small charge. In California, for example, the average fee is $13.25 a month. In some states the agencies are funded by donations from local businesses and civic organizations; in others, they keep 10 percent of the money they collect, although the client is credited with the full amount that he or she has paid."

Today, as he was questioned by opposition politicians in Parliament, Mr. Nakasone again insisted he had intended no slur against ethnic minorities nor the United States. On Tuesday, two Japanese newspapers quoted Mr. Nakasone as having said that the presence of blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans had impaired educational achievement in the United States.   The intellectuals and minority group members seized on his remarks as symptomatic of Japanese attitudes toward outsiders, whether they be foreigners or minorities within Japanese society. For some Japanese, these critics said, the nation's economic success has also bred arrogance."

American corporations are having to grapple with the possibility that remaining in South Africa may cost them substantial business with local and state governments at home and could drive down their stock price, according to many investment experts, consultants and corporate executives.   At least 18 American companies have pulled out of South Africa so far this year, and many of the 250 remaining seem to be re-examining their options. ''In five years almost no American investment will be left in South Africa,'' Pierre A. Rinfret, who runs an international business consulting firm in New York, predicted recently.   Even the International Business Machines Corporation, one of the largest companies in South Africa, said earlier this year that it was ''increasingly discouraged'' with the situation there. In conversations, both on and off the record, executives at several companies appeared far less sanguine about their South African operations than they were just a year ago."

They are all important questions, but the economic challenges most of us face are at the level of individual industries, individual companies and governmental agencies.

The study, which will strongly influence the Administration's policy toward junk bonds and, indirectly, toward the hostile takeovers that the bonds often finance, arrived at a startling conclusion: There is no cause for concern, even though junk bond issues have soared in recent years. Rather, the report concluded that junk bonds are an ''innovative reaction,'' with only such risks as were ''fully obvious'' to investors. There is no justification, it said, for limits to junk-bond financing in takeovers - or anywhere else, for that matter.   Such assurances ought to be welcome from an agency that was created to deal with highly leveraged holding companies and other securities abuses of the 1920's. Alas, in this study the S.E.C. staff lobbied the issues rather than explored them. The report seems designed more to discredit the Federal Reserve Board's recent ruling restricting junk bond financing of tender offers than to examine important issues."

The group believed responsible for the wave of Paris bombings has demanded the release of Mr. Abdallah and two other terrorist suspects."

In spite of revival efforts, the outlook for growth remains tepid at best, most analysts say. That means interest rates, which have been falling for the better part of a year, are likely to decline further.   ''The economy has been in a listless growth pattern ever since the middle of 1984,'' said Milton W. Hudson, senior vice president and head of the economic analysis department at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. ''It's a worrisome situation.'' News about the economy is never far from the minds of market participants, but it will return to center stage this week, now that the Treasury's $28 billion quarterly refunding has been completed. Government reports on industrial production and retail sales for July are scheduled to be released this week, the first real signs of how the economy is doing as it enters the second half of the year. Not many analysts are looking forward to great things."

Boeschenstein was young, his father, Harold, was put in charge of a company that was being formed by the Owens-Illinois Corporation and Corning Glass Works to manufacture glass fibers and develop uses for the new technology.   Forty-eight years after the founding of Owens-Corning Fiberglas, William Boeschenstein, the second member of his family to hold the title of chairman, finds himself in a desperate fight to retain control of the concern, which now has sales of more than $3 billion a year and a market value of more than $2 billion.   Earlier this week, Wickes Companies, a retail and building products concern, based in Santa Monica, Calif., started a hostile tender offer in an attempt to acquire Owens-Corning, a public company in which neither Corning nor Owens-Illinois has a stake. If successful, the $2.1 billion acquisition of Owens-Corning would be the boldest expansion move yet for Wickes, a company that emerged from bankruptcy last year under Sanford C. Sigoloff, its chairman, who has kept a high-profile while aggressively expanding his company."

According to reports there, three of the hijackers wore security personnel uniforms, consisting of light blue shirts and dark blue trousers. They were also apparently able to obtain security badges or stars in a marketplace in Karachi, the informants said.   In addition, officials said the Suzuki van the hijackers rented had apparently been painted the same blue color of the official van used by the airport security force. There was an unconfirmed report that they had added a light and a siren on the roof to help complete the disguise."

Price gains for other actively traded Treasury issues ranged from 18/32 to 1 1/2 points.

In the six years since it was introduced, losses from the monthly science magazine have mounted to an estimated $40 million.   Nevertheless Time, whose reputation in magazine publishing was virtually untarnished until it shut down the fledgling TV-Cable Week in 1983, seems determined this time not to throw in the towel.   In a commitment recalling its experience with Sports Illustrated, which lost money for 11 years before going into the black, the giant publisher has pulled out all the stops to turn Discover into a profitable late bloomer. Over the last two years, Time has brought in a new managing editor for the magazine, Gilbert Rogin, livened up its editorial approach, and in its most controversial - and costliest - move, spent close to $8 million to buy up the subscriber lists of two failing rivals in the overcrowded science field: Science 86, owned by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Science Digest, a Hearst publication."

''When we have dinner together, we don't talk that much about publishing,'' said Mr. Toffler, whose book, ''Future Shock,'' added a new expression to the language. ''Alberto is a very broad person, and we talk about organization, and computers and where the society is going.''   Not surprising for a publisher, some would say.

The car-bombings, one on Monday in a predominantly Christian suburb, the other 24 hours later in mostly Moslem West Beirut, killed a total of 58 people, wounded 300 and caused damage valued at $50 million. All of the casualties were said to be Lebanese.   The ''Slaughter of Innocents,'' as newspaper headlines here called it, was preceded by an outbreak of artillery duels across the Green Line, the demarcation line from the Mediterranean Sea to the southern suburbs that cuts the Lebanese capital into Christian and Moslem sectors. Four people, two of them children, were killed and 38 wounded when artillery shells struck residential areas on both sides of the line."

Practically, however, the monopoly ended just a few days ago, when the first of many would-be competitors cut a ribbon, flipped a switch and began offering its customers telecommunication services at rates from 20 to 25 percent lower than Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.   The new company, Japan Telecom, is but one of several that hope to compete in both domestic and international telecommunications markets that are hotly sought and estimated to be worth billions of dollars in potential sales. Its entry is another signal that the rules are changing, creating new opportunities for foreign companies and foreign products.   In monitoring the new market, Government officials and industry leaders have labored to make sure that competition was orderly. Rather than opening the market to all comers, Japan's regulatory authorities have preferred to designate a limited number of competitors so that the new entrants would not battle each other into bankruptcy."

Some of the horrors are self-inflicted; others a result of bad luck. One increasingly popular preventive: Hire a financial planner. The right one can help you avoid mistakes and devise a strategy to build your net worth through bad times and good.  Occasionally, however, planners play the villain. Recently, an Alabama planner sold a fake ''Treasury bond'' to a client -and spent the money. A New Jersey planner promised investors safety and high returns from a mysterious ''special money market account,'' and lost their money in a real estate venture. In Bellevue, Wash., a planner ''invested'' $100,000 of clients' funds in his own account - and disappeared."

As in the Manville case, it was the lawyers at Davis, Polk who suggested that LTV hire Levin & Weintraub & Crames - and in particular, Michael Crames, the principal lawyer for Manville - as bankruptcy counsel.   As the nation's largest bankruptcy, the LTV proceedings are likely to generate millions of dollars in legal fees for each of the firms. They were quite a plum - and, with 65 separate bankruptcy petitions and 10,000 pages of documents to prepare, quite a logistical challenge."

Now their captive finance subsidiaries are beginning to adopt some of the same tactics in developing new ''models'' of financing packages aimed at certain segments of the buying public.   Among the new products: balloon loans, which combine the features of leases and standard loans; loans tailored to recent college graduates, and variable-interest-rate loans.   The new financing plans have attracted little notice, so far, compared with the subsidized interest rate incentives offered by the auto companies for the past year. But finance executives say they could become important marketing tools in any post-incentive era because, as one executive put it, the plans are designed for buyers ''with little income compared to their appetite for a car, or for people who have more car in mind than money in their wallets.''"

Will it come to be dominated by a few giant carriers that set prices and service with a damn-the-consumer arrogance? Or will competition, abetted by judicious antitrust enforcement, continue to keep fares down and service up?   Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that we have already enjoyed the major benefits of deregulation and that its drawbacks will become increasingly apparent. Those drawbacks - primarily, barriers to effective competition - will be redressed only through selected new regulation. Consider the following points:    * The industry continues to experience dangerous swings in financial performance, and efficiency is no guarantee of success. Even carriers like People Express, a model of efficiency, often must fight to survive while some high-cost carriers lead the industry in profits."

In the process, the controversial Mr. Hersant, who controls 28 percent of French newspaper circulation, has tangled with the French courts, the Socialist Government, labor, and some heavy debt - as well as with his own reputation as a collaborationist during World War II.   But these days, things seem to be going his way. Le Figaro, his flagship paper, boasts a daily circulation of 367,236, the biggest of the Paris-based dailies. The 66-year-old Mr. Hersant won a seat in the National Assembly during March elections that swept Socialists from power.

The article, which will be published next month in The Atlantic Monthly, is based on a review of American intelligence data and on interviews with Soviet officials. It concludes that the plane penetrated Soviet airspace because of navigational errors by the Korean Air Lines crew and not, as the Soviet Union contended, because it was on an espionage mission.   The evidence gathered by American intelligence, which has not been made public, also contradicts the United States' initial contention that the Soviet Union had knowingly shot down the airliner, killing the 269 people aboard.

The merger of the one-time competitors dissolves the market share lead held by Levi Strauss & Company for the jeans market, and also thrusts VF into a virtual tie with Levi, its archrival, as the country's largest apparel manufacturer overall, industry analysts said.   The combination of Blue Bell, which makes Wrangler jeans, and VF, whose H. D. Lee division is the nation's third-most popular brand of jeans, gives VF at least 25 percent of the jeans market, analysts said. Levi, a closely held concern, has had market share as high as 30 percent in recent years, but analysts said that advantage has eroded and the merged companies may have surpassed Levi. Firm industry statistics were not available."

Since the United States Army, in conjunction with Bolivian antinarcotics police, began attacking cocaine processing laboratories in north-central Bolivia this month, ''we have interrupted the manufacturing flow of cocaine,'' the Ambassador, Fernando Illanes, told the Senate Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee.   And because illegal shipments of cocaine represent Bolivia's largest source of export income - larger, the Bolivian Government estimates, than all the legitimate sources of export income combined - there is now a ''desperate need for new dollars,'' he said.   State Department officials said the cocaine raids that began almost two weeks ago appeared to have disrupted Bolivia's economy. Bolivia ''has been coming under increasing pressure in recent days,'' a State Department official said, as black market sales of dollars have increased."

Even gold and platinum, which like silver have been out of favor for some time, have shown more life. Over the last year or so, gold is up about 23 percent, to the $350-an-ounce range, from about $285, and platinum is up 74 percent, to $435, from $250 an ounce. In the same period, silver has been fighting to stay above $5 an ounce. Silver, in fact, has not done a thing since it soared to $50 an ounce, from $11, in the great Hunt silver raids from September 1979 to January 1980, only then to collapse."

Mr. Conable will outline plans to make the institution of nearly 7,000 bureaucrats more active, flexible and creative in its role as coordinator of long-range economic programs for the poorest countries.   So far the former ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee has moved cautiously in the new job, making only a few personnel and administrative changes to reinforce a more direct management style.

Their former parent, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, however, said its earnings declined 8.5 percent, largely because of a 26-day strike and continued soft sales of A.T.& T. equipment.  The strong showing by the others - U S West, which climbed 11.5 percent; Bell Atlantic, 8.6 percent; Ameritech, 5.3 percent; Pacific Telesis, 16.2 percent; Nynex, 18.4 percent, and BellSouth, 11.3 percent - was attributed to increased demand for basic phone services and stringent cost-control measures.  ''The industry continues to show earnings improvement,'' said Neil Yelsey of Salomon Brothers. Analysts, saying the earnings were right on target with their expectations, predicted a bright future for the regional companies created from the breakup of A.T.& T. on Jan. 1, 1984. A.T. & T. A.T. & T. earnings declined to $422 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $461 million, or 41 cents a share for the comparable period last year. Revenues for the quarter were down 1.6 percent, to $8.42 billion, from $8.56 billion."

The estimate is higher than the 7,900 people known to have been seized in the entire seven months of the previous emergency decree, lasting from July 1985 to March 1986.   Civil rights officials who helped compile the estimate acknowledged, however, that some of it was guesswork based on previous experience of trying to calculate the number of people detained.   The latest Western effort to defuse South Africa's crisis, meanwhile, seemed to have run into fresh difficulties today when Britain's Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, who is representing the Europeaan Community, arrived in Lusaka, Zambia, to be told by President Kenneth D.

New revenue estimates based on the most recent economic forecasts by the Congressional Budget Office showed they would have find ways to raise an additional $17 billion over the next five years to bring in the same amount of money as the existing tax law.   The lawmakers and President Reagan have committed themselves to producing a new tax system that raises the same amount of revenue as the current law. The lower revenue created a problem for the negotiators because their efforts to make up the shortfall could force them to undo delicate agreements reached earlier.

The official death toll is 162 since June 12, when the state of emergency was declared."

The human rights group, Amnesty International, confirmed earlier reports that Elijah Barayi, president of the 500,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions, was arrested in South Africa over the weekend.   Leaders of the labor federation, which is known for its militant stand in opposition to apartheid, plan to come out of hiding today to announce a strategy for pressing the South African Government to free their imprisoned colleagues. Human rights groups estimate that 900 union activists have been arrested in the crackdown against labor, church and anti-apartheid leaders that began with the emergency decree on June 12."

Last week, the yen set new record levels of strength against the dollar. Although it closed Friday in New York at 156.25 yen to the dollar, still comfortably above the 150 level, many economists are predicting it could soon hit the 150 mark and below.  [ On Monday, Reuters reported that the dollar fell to a low of 155.12 yen at the opening of trading in the foreign-exchange market here. The United States currency had been as low as 154.85 yen before the opening in international trading by Tokyo operators in Sydney, Australia, and Wellington, New Zealand, against 156.15 at the New York close and 157.45 here on Friday, dealers said. ]  The economists believe that an exchange rate of 150 yen to the dollar would considerably slow Japan's already sluggish economic growth, further slash already-declining corporate profits and accelerate several trends set in motion by this year's rapid acceleration of the yen - moving production overseas, increasing imports of manufactured goods and shifting employment from manufacturing to the service sector."

Muammar el-Qaddafi was planning new acts of terrorism were based on ''a realistic assessment'' by American officials.   ''The U.S. Government is dealing with realities in this situation,'' Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said. ''This is a realistic assessment.''   His statement today was the latest in a series of differing assessments of the Libyan's intentions from Administration officials in Washington and other officials there and in California, where President Reagan is vacationing."

One step is to impose a $1,000 fine on airlines that carry passengers to West Germany without a valid visa and to oblige the airlines to take the passengers back. Visa-granting practices will be tightened at consulates.   Another measure, according to Government sources, is to extend to five years, from two, the period that asylum-seekers may not seek employment. Most applicants are believed to be seeking a rosier economic future, not fleeing political persecution."

No quick or conclusive end is in sight, and the safest prediction may be a prolongation of the costly conflict.   But there are a few signs that the deadlock might end or, at least, that the Persian Gulf war might dwindle into a sort of undeclared peace, according to several military analysts and foreign experts.   Since July 23 the Iraqi Air Force, which has almost total air superiority and freedom of action, has used more aggressive tactics against Iran's oil industry, these analysts say. While in previous years efforts to block Iranian oil exports had been largely ineffective, such ''low and slow'' bombing could tighten the economic screws on Iran if it persists."

The remarks by the spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, seemingly threw the weight of the Foreign Ministry behind the detention of Nicholas Daniloff, Moscow correspondent of the news magazine U.S. News & World Report.   Mr. Daniloff was arrested by agents of the K.G.B., the internal security agency, on Saturday in a park in the Lenin Hills after a Soviet acquaintance had handed him an envelope with unspecified secret maps and papers."

Shevardnadze and Prime Minister Shimon Peres met for more than an hour today, and Mr. Peres said they had agreed to consider normalizing relations between the Soviet Union and Israel.   It was the highest level at which Soviet and Israeli officials have met officially since Moscow severed relations after the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Some Israeli diplomats said they believed it was also the first high-level Soviet contact ever with an Israeli Prime Minister.   Both sides said the atmosphere was more constructive today than at talks last month in Helsinki, Finland, between Soviet and Israeli officials. Those talks broke down when the Israelis raised questions about the emigration of Soviet Jews."

Tire makers and recyclers are being pressed to answer that question, with more than 240 million scrap tires generated in this country each year.   The used tire - because of its size, shape and air-polluting properties when burned - has become one of the nation's most difficult disposal problems. Some of these tires are placed in landfills; others are sold as retreads. But most old tires are disposed of illegally - dumped by the side of the road or stockpiled, where they become fire hazards or harborages for rodents and mosquitoes."

Aluminum doors clatter open, clerks scurry inside, and a dazzling array of food begins to move from the trailers to the shelves.   It is a ritual repeated at supermarkets all over America, and one that has not changed much in the last decade. What has changed, though, is the origin of the food being unloaded.   Almost unnoticed in the national anxiety over rising imports of autos, steel, textiles, and electronic appliances, is the steadily increasing amount of foreign food consumed by Americans. Pork flows in from Canada, beef from Australia, tomatoes, broccoli and cauliflower from Mexico, olives from Portugal, apples from Chile, orange juice from Brazil, mushrooms from Taiwan - a myriad of foods that, despite transportation costs and United States tariffs, still carry lower price tags than their American counterparts."

The Sri Lankans' point of departure could have some bearing on their refugee status in Canada if it is shown that they had official residential status in a third country.   The Sri Lankans, all members of a predominantly Hindu minority group in an island nation where Buddhists are dominant, were found Monday drifting in two 28-foot lifeboats in rough seas off Newfoundland's southern coast. The refugees, almost all of them men, said they had been in the boats for five days after being put off a freighter."

It was a crime that not only took the life of the leftist Prime Minister of Grenada, Maurice Bishop, and 10 others nearly three years ago. It also brought about the death of a revolution proclaimed by the leftists, whose Government was seen by the Reagan Administration as a festering threat to the United States and its allies throughout the Western Hemisphere.   The killings grew out of a dispute over leadership of the radical Government, which was then four years old. After Mr. Bishop's death, a hard-line faction that called itself the Revolutionary Military Council took over and imposed a 24-hour curfew that made residents of the spectacularly beautiful little island prisoners in their own homes. Six days later, the United States sent in more than 5,000 marines and paratroopers in the first use of force in the Caribbean by American military units in nearly two decades."

''Drawing Iran into various international networks has the potential benefit of making it more sensitive to the views of those countries that it has to deal with, and if it works it would encourage Iranians in the leadership to be more outward-looking,'' a State Department official said.   The officials said they thought this was one of the calculations made by Saudi Arabia in acceding to a compromise with an enemy that has not only attacked Saudi shipping in the Persian Gulf during its six-year war with Iraq but has blatantly threatened to overthrow the Saudi and other conservative Gulf monarchies. U.S. Goal    The principal American political objective is a truce in the Iran-Iraq war.

It is the easiest factor to quantify, after all. One needs the computer, a monitor, a printer and perhaps a modem.   The cost of the software often comes as a nasty surprise, because the program needs are not so easy to define. A particular computer may start out almost as a dedicated word processor in its single-minded pursuit of business letters and memos. Then later scheduling software may be added to simplify the office routine, then a billing package, then a data base manager and so on. Still, it is possible to tally up the bills for the software purchased and arrive at some kind of a cost/benefit ratio."

''Congress has put a lot of teeth in the current proposals,'' said Robert M. Siper, director of pension consulting services for the accounting firm of KMG Main Hurdman. The extensive changes ''will not simplify anything'' in retirement planning, he added.   While the full dimensions of the proposed changes are still being debated, experts say the basic impact of the 1986 Tax Bill is clear. The new law is expected to reduce the attractiveness of 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts. In addition, tighter rules governing the funding of corporate pension plans would limit employees' options. One result: Individual taxpayers will have to shoulder more responsibility for organizing their own retirement plans. ''People will have to find other ways to shelter their income, and retirees will have to look to outside sources of income to supplement their retirement plan payments,'' said Richard B. Stanger, director of employee benefits services with Price Waterhouse. The best defensive stragegy is to take charge early on. ''Start planning for retirement the day you begin working, because it's anybody's guess how much you'll get from your company pension plan and Social Security,'' said Zeldy Lyman, a vice president at Kidder Peabody and Company."

Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, Senator Bob Dole, Senator Bill Bradley and Representative Dan Rostenkowski fell over each other praising the bill and themselves. ''We are really doing something for the taxpayer,'' each boasted.   But I wonder whether Congress is doing something for the taxpayer or something to the taxpayer that cannot be discussed in polite company. Politicians keep crowing that America will experience the most important tax bill ever, which I think is akin to experiencing the most important flu epidemic ever. Tax overhaul, like the flu, is an annual event - some years worse than others."

The answer, according to some officials at Japanese banks and securities firms here, is plenty. Some say investors may buy nearly as much as the estimated $2 billion to $3 billion in 10-year notes and $4 billion to $6 billion in 30-year bonds the Japanese are believed to have purchased at the last refunding in May.   ''Japanese investor attitude about the United States bond market is the same as in May, the spread between United States and Japanese interest rates is about the same, and the exchange rate looks more stable,'' said Akira Tokutomi, executive vice president for fixed income at Nikko Securities Internationl."

Limited-service banks, which the Fed has vigorously opposed, have come into being in recent years to provide commercial companies a way to enter banking. They escape the prohibition of a commercial company owning a bank by limiting their services to either making business loans or taking deposits, but not both.   Fed officials said the Household case underscored their concern that such banks were difficult to supervise and were susceptible to pressures from their commercial parents that could lead to poor loan quality."

Among its elements are the flight to Paraguay of a former French official, tales of false receipts and espionage operations in the African country of Burundi and the purchase of a castle in the French countryside.   The scandal centers on a sordid tale, being told by a single ranking official in the Socialist Government - which lost in elections last March and now shares power - of large-scale embezzlement and misuse of funds by senior Socialist leaders, charges that have led to the indictment of four lower-ranking figures already.   The scandal has gravely touched one cabinet member in the former Socialist Government and a major daily newspaper, the rightist Le Figaro, has tried to implicate President Francois Mitterrand, claiming in a headline Monday that ''Mitterrand Knew'' of the wrongdoing."

Two participants in the conference in a richly paneled 14th-century chamber at the university - Marian Turski of Warsaw and Lucjan Dobroszycki of New York - have consecutive numbers tattooed on their arms, having been processed at Auschwitz together.   Moreover, Mr. Dobroszycki, editor of ''The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto'' and a professor at Yeshiva University, was in his native land for the first time since 1968, when he left with tens of thousands of others amid an official anti-Jewish campaign."

While the announcement was intended to show support for a colleague and outrage at his arrest, and to reassure other journalists working abroad, it was also meant to signal that the nation's journalists have a role to play in the situation independent of the Government, the organizers said.   ''The time has come to speak for ourselves, to act for ourselves,'' said Eugene L. Roberts Jr., executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who initiated the effort to assemble the diverse journalistic group.   Thus far, the arrest of Nicholas S.

Until recently, Fermenta, a pharmaceutical and biotechnology concern, was an investors' favorite and one of the fastest-growing companies in Western Europe.   The announced sale marks a fall from grace for Mr. el-Sayed, the 40-year-old Egyptian-born founder of Fermenta and the owner of about 80 percent of its voting stock. Just last year, Mr. el-Sayed was named ''Swede of the Year'' by state-owned television for breaking into the traditionally closed Swedish business fraternity and becoming the nation's most successful entrepreneur. Largely through a series of acquisitions from 1982 to 1985, Fermenta's revenues jumped twentyfold, to about $190 million, while its pretax profits leaped 65 times, to an estimated $36 million."

But do not be beguiled into thinking that estate planning can be avoided altogether. To be sure your heirs get what you want them to have with minimum expense and aggravation, a will is necessary. If you die without one, the state government will step in to provide for the administration of your estate - and your assets will probably not pass according to your wishes.   In addition, the Federal Government and your home state may be major beneficiaries; costly court fees, high administrative costs and avoidable taxes can quickly erode the assets your family might have gotten."

The new higher education program, presented in the form of a draft decree of the ruling Communist Party, follows an overhaul last year of the system of elementary and high schools. The new plan is an attempt by the administration of Mikhail S. Gorbachev to bring universities and colleges into line with his plans for modernization and to make them a driving force for scientific and technical advances.   The aim of the program appears to be to end the traditional use of Soviet higher education as a training ground for narrow vocational and professional specialization. Instead, colleges will be expected to foster a broader-based education that would enable graduates to adapt themselves more readily to new technology and changing conditions."

Last Friday, two and a half weeks later, Texas Air announced that it had agreed to sell additional landing and takeoff slots at La Guardia Airport in New York to Pan American World Airways, a move that would reportedly enable Pan Am to operate a fully competitive shuttle service with Eastern's and should meet the Government's objections.

The indictment states that sufficient evidence has been obtained in connection with the case of Nicholas Daniloff giving ground to assert that, being connected with the United States secret services, on assignment from them and using the status of foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union, he engaged in espionage, gathering secret data in various ways for use to the detriment of the national interests of the Soviet Union. Change in Daniloff's Status    On familiarizing himself with the indictment, Nicholas Daniloff reluctantly put his signature, and his status changed from that of suspect to that of defendant.   The day of Aug. 30 turned out to be a hectic one for Nicholas Daniloff. He had a lot to do before his forthcoming departure from Moscow at the end of a period of work in the U.S.S.R. But nothing was so urgent as to compare with the upcoming important meeting that he had been awaiting impatiently. The day before, an old acquaintance of his had telephoned Daniloff."

It is the fourth time this year that the 13 ministers are reviewing their plans to limit oil output in an effort to reverse a price plunge of more than 50 percent in the last eight months.

For while the stock plunge on Wall Street last week got all the attention, the action in Chicago's futures markets was just as furious - and one of the main lessons was that the Chicago traders help shape what happens in New York.   ''If you take a look at the way the market jerks around in a day, it's hard to conclude that index futures contracts are not having a major impact on the volume and volatility in the equity marketplace,'' said B. Macon Brewer, chairman of the capital markets division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Stock index futures are contracts, bought and sold, that represent a bundle of underlying stocks. They go up and down with the stock market and enable investors to speculate on broad market rises and hedge against market falls. Often, futures prices swing more violently than the underlying stock prices because futures traders seek to anticipate market swings."

Gorbachev said today that the Soviet Union would withdraw six regiments from Afghanistan by the end of the year, and asked that the move be matched by a reduction of Western aid to the guerrillas.   In a televised speech from the Pacific coast city of Vladivostok, he also gave a noncommittal response to President Reagan's recent letter on arms control, and called for closer relations with China.   Western diplomats said the troop withdrawal would cut Soviet forces in Afghanistan by 6 percent. The number of soviet troops in Afghanistan is estimated at 120,000, and the number of Afghan guerrillas as high as 30,000. Call for Verification    Mr. Gorbachev said the six regiments would be withdrawn in such a way as to make possible verification by ''anyone interested,'' presumably meaning American spy satellites.

But belying the thousands of pages of statutory language, explanations and Internal Revenue Service regulations that will eventually emerge, the legislation holds the promise of removing for many taxpayers some of the layers of complexity that have so frustrated them during the tax filing season and encouraged many of them to spend endless hours during the rest of the year in search of tax-saving schemes.

The Minneapolis-based computer and controls company said yesterday that it was negotiating to purchase the much-sought-after aerospace operations of the Sperry Corporation, an acquisition that would make Honeywell a far more potent competitor in the military sector. 4,000 Jobs to Be Cut The company also said that it intended to eliminate about 4,000 jobs by year-end - an apparent response to the industrywide slump that has badly hurt Honeywell's already-ailing computer business. The reductions, affecting about 5 percent of the work force, will be accomplished through attrition, early retirements and layoffs, and will result in a charge of unspecified size against fourth-quarter earnings, the company said."

The debate is far from settled, but last week's sharp decline in bond prices was a clear sign that the fear of higher interest rates is growing. By late Friday, the bellwether 7 1/4 percent Treasury bonds were offered at 95 3/32 to yield 7.68 percent, down from 100 21/32 to yield 7.20 percent as recently as two weeks ago.   Securities dealers agreed that in the last several days there has been increased selling by institutional investors, including some of the ''big names'' whose judgments are widely respected. If others of the 3,500 or so major institutional investors in the country decide to join the ranks of the sellers, traders said, it would be hard to imagine that bond prices could do anything but decline."

For Piedmont, the Howard treatment has had an invigorating effect. Once a tortoise in the industry, it is now resolutely moving into the fast lane. With the best growth rate of all the major airlines, Piedmont has posted an unbroken string of yearly profits since deregulation in 1978, a rare achievement in the troubled airline industry. In the New York area, it has become the third-largest carrier, measured in the number of scheduled flights.   And in the investment world it is ''Hello Piedmont, goodbye People Express.'' The Southeastern carrier has replaced People Express as the analysts' favorite budding airline. They are flooding Wall Street with buy recommendations and Piedmont's stock is hitting new highs. Last week, bloodied People Express in a major retrenchment shut down its money-losing Frontier subsidiary and took it into bankruptcy court after failing to find a buyer."

Reports on the weekend shooting toll have become standard fare in Detroit's daily newspapers, and city high schools have begun searching students for weapons in an effort to curb increasingly violent behavior.   Last week, just hours into the new school year, a 15-year-old boy was shot in the abdomen and critically wounded outside Pershing High School.

Although most analysts still said that the 1978 legislation abolishing 40 years of tight Federal control over fares and routes was sound public policy, even some of deregulation's most ardent supporters have begun to worry that a wave of mergers could result in cartel-like conditions, not unlike those that deregulation was intended to supplant.   There are signs, said Alfred E. Kahn, the man who was deregulation's leading architect as head of the Civil Aeronautics Board, that the industry may be headed toward ''an uncomfortably tight oligopoly.'' Antitrust Efforts    To avoid this, Mr. Kahn said that antitrust enforcement efforts must be stepped up by the Reagan Administration, which he said has been much too willing to approve airline combinations."

Computers also were once analog and digital. But digital computers won out so overwhelmingly that people no longer bother to say ''digital computer.'' It is simply assumed that a computer is digital. But life may be stirring on the analog side. Scientists are starting to work on futuristic computers that might again make use of analog computing techniques. No one expects analog computing to recapture the mainstream of the computer world, but some think that analog techniques might be better suited for some tasks, such as recognition of objects in computer vision systems, that have so far defied solution by digital techniques.   ''I suspect the computers used in the future will be hybrid designs, incorporating analog and digital,'' said Terrence J. Sejnowski, professor of biophysics at Johns Hopkins University, who notes that the brain also uses a combination of digital and analog processing."

The Treasury said that the 3-year notes would be new issues, but that it would reopen - that is, issue more of - the outstanding 7 3/8 percent 10-year notes due May 1996 and 7.25 percent 30-year bonds due May 2016 auctioned at its May refunding, rather than offering new issues of these maturities.   Some dealers said that while this decision might make Japanese investors, who are large holders of the 10-year and 30-year securities, less interested in the auction, it was also likely to mean somewhat greater price stability in what has lately been a very volatile market.   Raymond Stone, chief financial economist for Merrill Lynch Captial Markets, said the composition of the offering - $9.5 billion each for the 3- and 10-year notes and only $9 billion for the 30-year bond - appeared to reflect some concern on the Treasury's part that investor appetite at the long end of the Government bond market might be lacking."

An army colonel was shot and killed near here this month. Since mid-July, 12 members of the paramilitary Civil Guard were killed by a car bomb in Madrid, an E.T.A. squad staged a grenade attack against the Defense Ministry and two guardsmen were killed by a booby-trap bomb near this Basque industrial city.   According to the police, 32 people have died in E.T.A. attacks since the beginning of the year.   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, vowing to wipe out E.T.A., has counterattacked with increased police force, offers of limited amnesty and heightened cooperation from France in handing back terrorist suspects and closing an E.T.A. sanctuary there."

Now many banks are going one step further by providing financial planning advice to help customers reconcile these investment opportunities with their financial needs.   Such financial counseling has long been available to the banks' wealthiest customers, albeit at a hefty price. Irving Trust, for instance, provides planning help to customers with more than $1 million in assets - for a fee of $3,000 to $5,000. The new services, however, are tailored to a different market: middle-income New Yorkers who need basic assistance in budgeting, minimizing taxes, purchasing insurance and investing for retirement. ''Traditionally, financial planning has been something for the wealthy,'' explained Chemical Bank spokesman Kenneth B. Herz. ''Now it's available to the masses.''"

Someone figured out that Mr. Schmidt had spoken to Parliament more than 500 times; his first salvo as a young Social Democratic legislator from Hamburg was aimed at the Postal Minister on Jan. 21, 1954.   Mr. Schmidt's discourse today was a national event, a spoken testament by a man who even out of power remains the country's most popular politician.   It was, formally, just another speech in a windy budget debate, a partisan event that elicits flashes of rhetoric meant for the television cameras and the evening news programs. But for Mr. Schmidt, who will not be running for Parliament in elections that will be held Jan. 25, it was farewell."

But, alas, that is the destiny of our profession. Stepping back from the details of the 1986 tax reform bill and focusing on the big picture, it is evident that the impending changes in the Internal Revenue Code will depress the economy.   True, most individual and family taxpayers will pay less in Federal taxes. But, simultaneously, the ''revenue neutral'' tax bill will shift $120 billion of Federal taxes to business over the next five years. Politically, that is a neat switch. Our political representatives can first crow about cutting our taxes and then sympathize when prices rise more rapidly or when wages rise more slowly as companies adjust to the higher tax burden. The economic problem is that taxes are being raised on savings and investment, key ingredients for economic growth and job creation."

''Survival is at stake,'' he declared in a letter to employees last month, ''and there is no time to lose.''   Mr. Hoge does have his problems. Faced with a persistent erosion in circulation, an ever tougher competition in covering the news, and now the loss of $11 million in department store advertising - the kind that pays the rent - he is trying to keep The News alive in a saturated market where true prosperity can likely come only by knocking out a competitor.   Part of Mr. Hoge's strategy is a renewed effort to bring in additional advertising. But he has also warned employees that costs must be cut, and jobs will go. As some union leaders see it, the publisher is accentuating the paper's difficulties to soften them up for coming contract negotiations, in which The News is certain to seek concessions from unionized workers."

Nearly all of the bill's provisions affecting individuals take effect Jan. 1.   ''People typically tend to accelerate deductions and postpone income,'' said Ira H. Shapiro, the director of tax policy at Coopers & Lybrand, an accounting firm.

Attention was focused mainly on the decision-making lower chamber, where every major poll suggested that the governing Liberal Democratic Party would strengthen its hold on power and could even manage a landslide victory.   To a large degree, the dimension of that presumed victory has become the dominant issue.

The topic continued to be aired this week as discussion centered both on the effect on last Friday's ''triple witching hour'' of the Securities and Exchange Commission's voluntary experiment to curb volatility and a report in The New York Times yesterday that the commission was considering a number of new approaches. These include limiting the number of index options an investor can hold at any one time and raising margin requirements.

Investment bankers are confident that investor demand will not be badly damaged under the proposed Federal tax bill and that new financings will be readily absorbed when activity rebounds later this year.   Because yields of tax-exempt issues rose earlier this year, relative to taxable bond yields, many analysts agree with Aaron Gurwitz, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., who said the reduced supply of new tax-exempt issues and the elimination of other tax shelters and income deductions ''should translate into an improvement in the relative value of long-term municipals.''   The municipal market will still be vulnerable to fluctuations in the demand for tax-exempt bond interest from casualty insurance companies, but on balance ''it is apparent that tax-exempt securities remain attractive investments for individuals and for property-casualty insurers,'' the Salomon analyst concluded.

According to a recent study by Kidder, Peabody & Company, the proposed alternative minimum income tax for individuals, which would tax interest on some kinds of nonessential function local government bonds issued after Aug. 7, ''may not be as negative as was initially thought.''

Mr. Gorbachev's speech, at a Polish party congress, contained some of the strongest criticism of the United States since the Soviet Union began issuing arms control initiatives early this year.   ''The cause of disarmament has not been advanced by a single millimeter because of the American Administration's open obstruction,'' he said.   ''Worse, Washington is destroying the remaining constraints containing the arms race - the SALT II treaty and other Soviet-American agreements. American officials are not short on eloquent statements about their desire for peace and disarmament, but they are doing just the opposite.''"

But under the new bill, the proceeds from selling the stock would be taxed at 28 percent rather than the 20 percent capital gains rate of the present law.  An incentive stock option program is but one type of executive compensation that would be significantly affected by the proposed tax changes. Pension plans, company savings programs, deferred compensation - all of the various ways executives are rewarded - are likely to change under the new bill."
