The companies serve a sprawling and eclectic list of specialized interests. Primedia has a few big titles, including New York and Seventeen, but it has largely collected about 100 consumer fan magazines.

It now comprises more than 700 sites on topics from astrology to woodworking.

[C4.]    Share Sale in Sky Global Delayed  The News Corporation, which had been planning to sell part of its global satellite businesses, Sky Global Networks, to the public next month, has postponed the sale because of market conditions, a person close to the company said. Despite the delay, News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is in talks with Microsoft about selling a nearly $1 billion stake in Sky Global, which would give Microsoft 3.5 percent of the company.

G.M. said that it would produce 14.5 percent fewer vehicles in the next three months than it did in the first quarter of this year. Its shares fell 69 cents, to $51.38. Ford had already announced that its output would be down 10 percent. And while Chrysler has not disclosed its first-quarter production plans, it is also expected to make fewer cars by eliminating overtime and by not operating some factories at all for a week or two at a time. [Page C2.]    Senate Approves Bankruptcy Bill  The Senate approved a major overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws, passing legislation by an overwhelming margin that makes it harder for people to seek legal protection from payment of their debts. But the bill's prospects for becoming law are uncertain at best because Congress may not get the opportunity to override President Clinton's threatened veto before lawmakers adjourn for the year. [A1.]    The Nexus of Privacy and Security  At SafeNet 2000, a Microsoft-sponsored conference on computer security and privacy, high-technology businesses and advocacy groups touched on all the major policy issues facing technology companies. It showed, as Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, said in a keynote address, that privacy and security ''are tied together in a very deep way.'' [C4.]    Stocks Slide on Technology Worries  Stocks fell only modestly even as investors found more reasons to worry about technology earnings. The Nasdaq composite index lost 43.84 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,752.66. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,343.55. And the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 47.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,617.36. [C7.]    Motorola to Fall Shy of Estimates  Motorola said that it would fall short of Wall Street's sales and profit projections for the current quarter because of sharply reduced demand for its chips and continuing profit margin erosion in its cell phone business. [C3.]    High-Profile TV Shows Canceled  Three broadcast networks moved to shake up their prime-time schedules, canceling several of the most publicized new programs of the season, including NBC's ''The Michael Richards Show'' and Fox's ''The Street.'' Taken with other cancellations announced recently, and sliding ratings for some other heavily anticipated series, the new television season, which began with promise, is now listing badly as it heads for its midseason changes. [C6.]    3 Research Centers for California  Gov. Gray Davis of California announced the creation of three research institutions dedicated to nanotechnology, biotechnology, and telecommunications and computing. [A30.]    Brazil Optimistic on Phone Auction  Despite waning interest in cellular phone licenses, the government of Brazil hopes to raise at least $3.4 billion over the next three months by selling nine licenses to offer mobile phone services.

The blast came a day after 17 Americans were killed in an apparent terrorist attack at a Yemeni port. The cause of the blast was not immediately known, but British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said it appeared a bomb had been thrown over a wall into the embassy area. ""It was not a particularly professional attack, rather an opportunistic one, and it seems to have landed on a diesel generator and has caused quite a substantial explosion,"" he said in an interview with Britain's Sky News. At the time of the blast, shortly after dawn, only a Yemeni night guard was on duty, a British Embassy spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. ""We sustained considerable damage to the building itself,"" she said. The explosions in Yemen, an impoverished country on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, come amid anti-U.S. fervor in the region sparked by two weeks of Israeli-Palestinian clashes. The embassy explosion shook the entire neighborhood, said Hisham al-Qubati, a secretary at the nearby Yemen Times building. ""I heard a loud explosion at 6:05 a.m. (11:05 p.m. EDT, Thursday) and rushed over to the embassy. They wouldn't let us in, but I could see shattered windows and the damage to a school next to the embassy,"" al-Qubati said. Beyond damage to the three-story embassy and neighboring school, both of which normally are closed on Fridays, the explosion just after dawn blew out windows of the nearby Dutch Embassy. Several embassies are located in the neighborhood. A forensics team was trying to determine the cause of the blast, the embassy spokeswoman said."

Ambulances raced to the Mahane Yehuda market, which sells food, vegetables and clothing in Jewish west Jerusalem. Huge plumes of black smoke rose into the sky. Israel TV said that the two people killed were the bombers, but the report could not immediately be confirmed. The blast came shortly before Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were scheduled to make separate announcements of steps toward a cease-fire -- an effort to stop more than a month of fighting that has left at least 162 people dead, most of them Palestinian. An Israeli soldier, Oshri Atun, said he saw a white sedan being chased by a police van with sirens wailing. The car turned into a side street, and seconds later the bomb exploded, Atun said. Another witness, who only gave his first name, John, said he heard a powerful blast. ""When I looked down the street, there was a big fire and people were hurt,"" he said. There was no immediately claim of responsibility. However, the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have said they would carry out new terror attacks in Israel. The leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, has said the Palestinian uprising against Israel would continue. Yassin said the protests are an expression of popular anger and could not be reined in by an order from Arafat. Also, Israeli army spokesman Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey said Thursday he had detailed warnings about attacks, and Israeli security forces have been on high alert for the past few weeks. For years, the market -- spread over several blocks of a predominantly religious neighborhood -- has been a choice target for those trying to sabotage peace between Israelis and Palestinians. It was the scene of a car bomb in November 1998 that killed two suicide bombers and wounded 21 other people. Hamas claimed responsibility. And in July 1997, two militants blew themselves up in the area, killing themselves and 16 shoppers. Dozens have been killed at the market since the 1960s. Palestinian militants with explosives strapped to their bodies have blown themselves up in the narrow, cobblestone lanes or detonated car bombs on the larger streets. The market is closed off to vehicular traffic during shopping hours."

Arafat told reporters after meeting with French President Jacques Chirac that a three-way meeting that had been planned with he, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Barak, was not a sure thing. ""The meeting (with Barak) will depend on the one I will have with Albright,"" said Arafat. Asked what his conditions were, he said, ""Protection and an international inquiry commission."" A senior Palestinian official has said an international inquiry into Israel's actions would be a condition of reviving the peace talks. But Barak's office has said he ""totally rejected the call for an international investigation."" ""I think that, if there are questions and if there are queries, we can answer them ourselves. We don't need a committee biased against Israel to investigate things,"" Justice Minister Yossi Beilin told Israel radio Wednesday. Albright arrived at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Paris on Wednesday to start the talks aimed at stopping six days of violence that have left at least 58 people dead in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, and salvage the already-stalled Middle East peace process. She met with both Barak and Arafat Wednesday separately. At about the same time, Chirac met with Barak, who was accompanied by his most senior military adviser, Danny Yatom. Fighting broke out last week after an Israeli hardline leader, Ariel Sharon, visited one of Jerusalem's most hotly contested holy sites, a spot revered by both Jews and Muslims. State Department spokesman Philip Reeker, speaking in Washington, said CIA director George Tenet planned to join Albright in Paris. Reeker said Tenet will take part in discussions on security issues. As diplomatic efforts gained momentum, there were no signs of the violence abating. Two Palestinians were shot dead early Wednesday in the West Bank, and three Israeli military outposts in the Gaza Strip came under attack overnight. In northern Israel, a large forest fire raged Wednesday, one of more than 100 blazes that police believe have been set by Arab arsonists. Most have been extinguished. Europe has pointed the finger of blame at Sharon, who visited a shrine, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Al Haram As-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. The dispute over who will control the site is the main obstacle to a peace agreement. Chirac has blamed the violence on an ""irresponsible provocation"" -- a clear reference to Sharon's visit to the holy site. Sharon, notorious among Palestinians for launching the bloody war against Arafat's forces in Lebanon in 1982, said he bore no responsibility. After the Paris talks, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key player in the Middle East peace process, is planning a leadership summit on Thursday. Barak and Arafat have both agreed to come, Mubarak said Tuesday. Officials said the Paris talks would not just be a bid to stem the tide of violence. ""The meeting ... is a step in the direction of the renewal of the negotiations and not just the end of violence here,"" Israeli Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told Israel radio. A diplomatic drive, led by Clinton, to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement had lost momentum even before the recent violence, stalling after a July summit in Camp David."

Many rural high school students do not have access to calculus and other advanced math courses. As a result, they enter universities at a disadvantage. Hundreds of such rural students have been getting the mathematics courses they need through the NetMath program at the University of Illinois. In NetMath, each high school student has a personal Internet mentor, an Illinois undergraduate. The mentor guides the high school student through the math course via e-mail, telephone, Internet chat or Internet screen sharing.    J. J. UHL  Champaign, Ill.

At midday Thursday, Bebinca was in the vicinity of Catanduanes province, about 360 kilometers (225 miles) east of Manila, with sustained winds of 120 kph (75 mph). It was moving at 19 kph (12 mph) westward and was expected to pass about 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of metropolitan Manila on Friday, said the weather bureau, which raised high storm alerts over about a dozen provinces on the eastern side of the Philippines. Last week, typhoon Xangsane plowed through the main island of Luzon, knocking down power lines, flooding many provinces north of Manila and stranding thousands of commuters, some for two days, on flooded roads. In its latest report, the office of civil defense said Xangsane left 40 people dead, 249 injured and 54 missing. In addition, the coast guard said 12 crew members of a fishing boat not listed by the civil defense office remained missing after their boat sank Sunday off La Union province northwest of Manila.

Under the terms of the approval, AOL and Time Warner agreed that they will not unfairly muscle out rivals from the emerging media and entertainment markets in Europe, the European Commission said. In a statement, the commission of the 15-nation European Union said that AOL is to sever its structural links with German media giant Bertelsmann AG. That condition is meant to allow Bertelsmann to remain an independent competitor in Europe. ""The commission has a duty to prevent creation of dominant positions in all sectors, be they in the old or new economy,"" said EU antitrust commissioner Mario Monti. Antitrust officials were concerned about a resulting integrated company that ""could have dominated the online music distribution market and music players,"" Monti said. The AOL-Time Warner merger still has to be cleared by U.S. antitrust authorities, but the EU decision was seen as key for the chances of the merger going through. Sources said the EU antitrust authorities only formally endorsed the merger after the companies agreed to several concessions, including ending ties with Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media company. That move will prevent AOL ""from having access to Europe's leading source of music publishing rights, thereby eliminating the risk of dominance in the emerging markets for online delivery of music over the Internet and software-based music players,"" the commission statement said. The companies also have provided guarantees that they will not unfairly discriminate against other companies that provide Internet content or within the music industry. The vote of the 20-member commission on Wednesday came at its weekly meeting -- two weeks ahead of its deadline. EU authorities made quick progress on the issue after Time Warner last week dropped a separate joint venture plan with EMI Group of Britain, which would have created a major music company. European regulators had strongly opposed that deal. With Bertelsmann, Europe's largest media company, competing on its own, the commission said it concluded that AOL-Time Warner ""wouldn't have the critical mass in terms of music publishing to dominate the market."" Bertelsmann's BMG subsidiary is one of the world's five major music companies and EU antitrust officials feared the merger would have left the new company with the ability to keep the industry in a stranglehold. Bertelsmann is investing heavily to become the largest supplier of media content via the Internet. The antitrust division of the commission opened a probe into the proposed AOL-Time Warner merger in June, stressing the need for an open, competitive environment in the emerging cybermusic and entertainment markets."

Shuts Down Chat Room,"WASHINGTON -- The CIA has fired four employees and reprimanded dozens of others for participating in a secret chat room hidden in the agency's computer system, The Washington Post reported Friday. The newspaper said the disciplinary action was described as the largest in the agency's history, and followed a seven-month investigation that involved 160 employees and delved into activities going back 15 years. The CIA issued a statement that said the investigation found no ``unauthorized disclosure of classified information.'' A memo to all employees said investigators uncovered ``a concerted and sustained effort on the part of a group of individuals to create, maintain and hide databases on the agency's computer systems.'' The agency's statement said four employees were stripped of security clearances, ``rendering them ineligible for continued CIA employment,'' the Post reported. Eighteen others received letters of reprimand. ``Most of them will be suspended without pay for periods ranging from five to 45 days,'' the agency said. Nine contractors also were stripped of security clearances, which means they cannot work on CIA contracts, the statement said. Seventy-nine other CIA employees with ``minimal involvement'' in the computer scheme received either warning letters or security briefings. But former CIA employees with firsthand knowledge of the secret chat rooms told the newspaper that the disciplinary actions were an overreaction by CIA management. Ross Stapleton-Gray, a former CIA analyst who participated in the covert communications channels when he worked at the agency from 1988 to 1994, said those involved were primarily computer-savvy employees who enjoyed a sense of community with other ``techies.'' The agency said the first secret chat room was created as an ``unofficial user's group'' on the CIA's mainframe computer in the mid-1980s. ``Over the years, as the agency migrated to new information systems, the hidden databases were moved to take advantage of these new systems,'' the statement said."
