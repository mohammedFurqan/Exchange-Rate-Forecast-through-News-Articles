Gotham's proposal, which has the support of several of the trust's other large shareholders, would use a rights offering to raise at least $105 million and combine that with a senior loan of at least $350 million to replace some of the trust's high-cost debt and give it the financial wherewithal to operate the property."

Stop & Shop, the supermarket leader by a mile in southern New England with well-managed stores that have been praised for their variety and spaciousness, has begun a southward push into what its executives, like Whitehall officials, call ""the new territories"": the suburbs of New York City."

Joe O'Neill, executive vice president and national creative director of Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco, has left that agency after almost five years there. Mr. O'Neill attributed his decision, reported this week in Adweek, to steps by Hal Riney, chairman and chief executive, to become more active again in agency operations. Mr. O'Neill said he would either join an agency on the East Coast or open a shop of his own in the West."

Many of my students are workers, though -- and, boy, do they complain about their bosses. They also complain about the pay, the customers and the job conditions, but mainly they complain about what they see as the fundamental unfairness of having to take orders from someone else.  When I was their age, I studied unfairness with one of the most eloquent teachers I have ever had, even though he said little more than 20 words to me the whole time. It was 1965, and I had been hired by Sears in my hometown of Baton Rouge, La., to install appliances, but since I was just a 20-year-old college kid working for the summer, the supervisor assigned me to Mr. Andrews, who was older (somewhere in his 40's), shorter (built like a fireplug) and always seemed to be angry."

National Guardian, based in Greenwich, Conn., has about 275,000 customers in the United States and had $213 million in revenue last year, Ameritech said. In June, LEP announced plans to sell National Guardian as part of an effort to reduce debt. Ameritech, the regional Bell company based in Chicago, entered the security-monitoring business last year with the purchase of Securitylink, an Illinois company with about 44,000 customers."

For 12 days this month, this smoggy northern Italian city became a burst of bright bunting, music and street theater, as the big Fiat S.p.A. automobile company introduced a range of compact cars bearing the names Bravo and Brava. Earlier, in Barcelona's huge Olympic Stadium, in northern Spain, France's Renault S.A. displayed, with a bit less fanfare but equal hopes, a similar line of cars called Megane.   Both car makers have traditionally been linked in European minds with their staples, mini-cars and subcompacts. Their new models, priced aggressively and with a styling that has more Latin flair than northern European stolidity, are a frontal assault on the next level in the European market: slightly larger and sturdier compacts. That is the largest, most profitable segment -- but one that they have all but ceded to Volkswagen A.G., the Ford Motor Company and the Adam Opel A.G. division of the General Motors Corporation."

Just a day or two before Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, testified before the House ethics committee on Aug. 1, largely about a lucrative book contract between his company's HarperCollins publishing subsidiary and the House Speaker, the same subsidiary abruptly killed plans to publish a glossy coffee table book whose photographs focused on Mr. Gingrich."

The reorganization raises questions about what directions the individual businesses will take and what investors can expect.   A big advantage of the breakup appears to be that it will help AT&T expand around the world at a time when many countries are rushing to modernize their telephone systems. By splitting off its equipment business from its long-distance operations, AT&T can avoid the conflicts of trying to sell technology to European and Asian companies that are its competitors in long distance."

In recent speeches and interviews, Mr. Castro and his senior aides have criticized the Clinton Administration as sharply as ever, attacking its support for the American economic embargo against Cuba and describing its proposal to increase contact between the countries as sabotage in disguise."

Many of my students are workers, though -- and, boy, do they complain about their bosses. They also complain about the pay, the customers and the job conditions, but mainly they complain about what they see as the fundamental unfairness of having to take orders from someone else.  When I was their age, I studied unfairness with one of the most eloquent teachers I have ever had, even though he said little more than 20 words to me the whole time. It was 1965, and I had been hired by Sears in my hometown of Baton Rouge, La., to install appliances, but since I was just a 20-year-old college kid working for the summer, the supervisor assigned me to Mr. Andrews, who was older (somewhere in his 40's), shorter (built like a fireplug) and always seemed to be angry."

For 12 days this month, this smoggy northern Italian city became a burst of bright bunting, music and street theater, as the big Fiat S.p.A. automobile company introduced a range of compact cars bearing the names Bravo and Brava. Earlier, in Barcelona's huge Olympic Stadium, in northern Spain, France's Renault S.A. displayed, with a bit less fanfare but equal hopes, a similar line of cars called Megane.   Both car makers have traditionally been linked in European minds with their staples, mini-cars and subcompacts. Their new models, priced aggressively and with a styling that has more Latin flair than northern European stolidity, are a frontal assault on the next level in the European market: slightly larger and sturdier compacts. That is the largest, most profitable segment -- but one that they have all but ceded to Volkswagen A.G., the Ford Motor Company and the Adam Opel A.G. division of the General Motors Corporation."

Just a day or two before Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, testified before the House ethics committee on Aug. 1, largely about a lucrative book contract between his company's HarperCollins publishing subsidiary and the House Speaker, the same subsidiary abruptly killed plans to publish a glossy coffee table book whose photographs focused on Mr. Gingrich."

The reorganization raises questions about what directions the individual businesses will take and what investors can expect.   A big advantage of the breakup appears to be that it will help AT&T expand around the world at a time when many countries are rushing to modernize their telephone systems. By splitting off its equipment business from its long-distance operations, AT&T can avoid the conflicts of trying to sell technology to European and Asian companies that are its competitors in long distance."

In recent speeches and interviews, Mr. Castro and his senior aides have criticized the Clinton Administration as sharply as ever, attacking its support for the American economic embargo against Cuba and describing its proposal to increase contact between the countries as sabotage in disguise."

Mitsui, a trading company based in Tokyo, said the company it plans to buy, the Ocelot Ammonia Company, has the capacity to make 270,000 tons a year of liquid ammonia, which is used in synthetic resins and fertilizers. The company plans to ship 170,000 tons of the liquid ammonia to American fertilizer makers and will send the remaining 100,000 tons to Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, a Mitsui spokesman said."

The success rate for takeover deals, depending on which management expert is doing the calculating, is 50 percent or less. And combining two big, established institutions like Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan into one huge corporation will undoubtably be a long and painful process.   But many experts in banking were giving the deal, announced yesterday, better-than-even odds of working out in the long term, largely because Chemical has already been through the process when it merged with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation in 1991."

Then again, there's a lot in the tale of John J. Kilcullen and the "" . . . for Dummies"" publishing phenomenon that could have come straight from Broadway.   For starters, take the concept itself -- a line of how-to computer and personal finance books written specifically for people willing to admit, indeed to glory, in their own ignorance and technophobia. Major booksellers and publishers, who said readers wouldn't buy books about their inadequacies, now clamor to stock or to imitate the bright yellow and black paperback volumes that take the side of people challenged by the complexities of modern life, making the series ""a reference for the rest of us."""

Presidents have come and gone since those final apocalyptic scenes of a long, wretched war -- the American Ambassador fleeing from Saigon with the embassy's flag folded under his arm, the fevered scramble for the last seats on the last helicopter out.

TELEVISION  Is the Buzz the Message?  You didn't watch ""Central Park West"" last week? That took great strength of character, considering the mind-boggling effort that CBS, desperate to lure younger viewers with something glitzy, put into hyping the show. It went way beyond buzz -- the network enlisted every bee in its hive to promote this one: the stars' faces adorning Manhattan buses, ""advertorials"" (horrible word), board games, even a World Wide Web site. The goal, as one marketing type put it: ""entertainment-fashion-media-advertising synergy."" Whew! That's a mouthful.  HEALTH CARE  Will This Fix Medicare?  House Republicans were determined to slash $270 billion out of seven years' worth of projected Medicare spending, and last week they said they'd found a way. But have they? Yes, premiums would rise -- slightly for most, sharply for the rich -- but the plan is short on incentives to nudge the elderly into H.M.O.'s. Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich insist that a free market in health care choices will make it all better -- even without those incentives. But critics like Representative Henry Waxman said cuts in payments to doctors would ""destroy Medicare in a few short years."" And many elements of the plan are still vague, prompting Democrats to say crucial details are being hidden.  ROCKEFELLER CENTER  It's Hard Being a Trophy  How can this happen? One of the world's prize properties, Rockefeller Center, is caught up in such convoluted financial games that billions are being lost on it. The answer is that no one really ""owns"" such a place, one merely owns the right to collect rents and pay the bills -- but that right is a dubious trophy indeed when the bills exceed the rents. Last week Mitsubishi Estate decided it wanted no more of such losing math and bailed out -- and expects to pay $1 billion for its lesson in New York real estate economics. At which point more investors -- like Sam Zell and Goldman, Sachs -- rushed in, cash in hand, to make it even more complicated. The venerable buildings didn't even sway. POLITICS  Tobacco Money for the G.O.P.  At a time when it faces various regulatory threats -- Government efforts to label nicotine an addictive drug, for instance, and to reduce sales to teen-agers -- the tobacco industry is pouring money into Republican coffers. In the first half of this year, the industry contributed $1.5 million, five times as much as last year's first six months. Nearly half that sum came from Philip Morris. Representative Henry Waxman said the tobacco industry ""has gotten its hooks into the Republican leadership."" And the head of Common Cause called the heavy donations ""a desperate last effort."" But a spokesman for Brown & Williamson -- also a donor -- cited his company's belief in the Republican vision of ""less government, less red tape."" COMMUNICATIONS Policing the Internet  Computer networks are indisputably glorious things. No stamps, no paper, no fuss. A generation that thought letter-writing had surely died in a sun-washed 19th-century morning room has suddenly started to communicate. Now, alas, comes the dark side. Some people are using this strange new toy to send out child pornography or even lure children to sex. This gets complicated, for even if you get past the ethical question -- isn't private communication private? -- a huge practical one remains: how can you possibly monitor the zillions of 1's and 0's zooming through cyberspace? You can't always, of course, but last week -- after a four-year F.B.I. investigation -- came dozens of arrests for on-line porn and solicitation. THE WORKPLACE  Women's Progress, Stalled  Are women moving steadily closer to equal status in the workplace? Surely nothing could stop the momentum of recent years. Or could it? In a poll out last week, only 56 percent of women said the role of women was continuing to change -- down from 73 percent five years ago. Do women ""face more restrictions"" than men? Yes, said 84 percent, with 77 percent saying sexual discrimination ""remains a serious problem."" And 76 percent said there was sexual harassment in the workplace.  STATISTICS  Do-It-Yourself Inflation  Numbers flow mercilessly from the Government -- statistics with little apparent purpose except to keep statisticians busy -- and many are easily ignored. But not the Consumer Price Index. ""This is real,"" said Pat Moynihan. ""Everything else is talk."" This mighty inflation gauge, after all, dictates cost-of-living increases for Social Security and adjustments in tax brackets, and the tiniest blip translates into billions of dollars. What a gift to budget-cutters, then, if the index was found to be flawed. Sure enough, last week a Congressional panel said the index greatly overstates inflation -- and fixing it could trim $634 billion from the deficit over 10 years. This wouldn't exactly be a gift to retirees, though. Part of the index's flaw, it seems, is that it doesn't pick up shifts in buying patterns in response to higher prices. So if this ""flaw"" is fixed, Social Security recipients struggling to stretch their budgets would, in a sense, be doing the Government a favor, not themselves.  TRANSPORTATION  Tunnel of Lost Cash  Talk about a money pit! The Channel tunnel cost such a staggering sum to build -- $15 billion -- that it now faces interest costs of more than $3 million a day. A day! The tunnel's doing fine, mind you -- Eurostar trains are 75 percent full. But there's no way it can shell out that killer interest, and last week the company that runs it said it would simply not pay much of that interest for perhaps 18 months. Which means, of course, that big changes are coming -- and investors will be out a lot of money. But it will certainly keep running. ""You cannot sell a hole in the ground for much,"" said a Eurotunnel executive, ""if you've closed it."" THE MARKETS  Stocks Are Up. Period.  The facts: The stock market kept soaring last week -- setting records, topping 4,800 for the first time. The reasons: Oh, please don't ask; no one really has any idea why the market does what it does."

Harcourt General, parent of the retailer Neiman-Marcus, did not proceed very far in the talks, but the fact talks were held indicates that Westinghouse would consider a partner. Harcourt weighed an approach to CBS last year, various people said, but is unlikely to join in this time, partly because of the deal's high price.  [ 35. ] City May Privatize Jails  New York City asked for proposals to privatize all or part of the city's jails. When it is clear how much interest private companies show, the city will decide how to proceed. The city spends almost $750 million a year to run the jail system.  [ 1. ] Tobacco Farmers Fight Back  Tobacco farmers denounced President Clinton's call for regulations to reduce teen-age smoking. A cooperative in North Carolina representing 180,000 growers in five states joined the nation's five largest tobacco companies in suing to block the plan, that would give the F.D.A. the authority to regulate the sale, distribution and promotion of cigarettes. Farmers said that state laws already barred the sale of cigarettes to minors, and that the Government should not influence a teenager's decision on whether to smoke. The regulations proposed by Mr. Clinton were based on the F.D.A.'s finding that nicotine is an addictive drug and thus subject to the agency's control.  [ 1. ] Morgan Stanley Jumps Into China Morgan Stanley began China's first international investment bank with a Chinese company and other partners from Hong Kong and Singapore. The investment is expected to give Morgan Stanley an advantage over its competitors in winning deals involving project financing, direct investment and equity and bond offerings at a time when China needs to finance enormous infrastructure projects. The new firm has a capitalization of $100 million and is headquartered in Beijing. Ten Morgan executives will be based there, giving Morgan the largest presence in Beijing of any American investment bank.  [ 34. ] A Capitalist Farm Thrives in Vietnam A capitalist showcase is blossoming on a farm in Vietnam. A Dutch farmer recruited by a British entrepreneur is cultivating 75 acres of vegetables and flowers in the highland area. Vegetables are being shipped out almost daily, mostly for export to upscale restaurants in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan. The company is the first wholly foreign-owned agricultural and horticultural investment in Vietnam. One attraction is that costs are lower than elsewhere in Asia. The farm is headed toward its first year of profit.  [ 34. ] S.E.C. Internet Service May End  A service offering free Internet access to S.E.C. filings will be discontinued on Oct. 1. Executives said they hoped the Federal Government would take over the service, known as Edgar.  [ 35. ] In Recycling, New York City Pays  While suburban areas around New York make money by selling recycled metal, glass and plastic -- Oyster Bay, L.I., gets $25 a ton and Mercer County, N.J. $9.50 a ton -- New York City pays recycling operators $40 to $50 a ton to take away such material. City sanitation officials call it ""a fair deal.""  [ 23. ]"

You often hear of top executives getting them -- windfalls that would pay off the mortgages in entire neighborhoods, with enough left for a few centuries' worth of groceries. But at Chemical Bank, some goodies trickled down to humbler workers last week, too; when the stock topped $50 for three days running, a share plan announced a year ago kicked in. The numbers had considerably fewer decimal places than those in executive pay packages -- a profit of $1,481 (before taxes) -- but it did spark interest. ""It was amazing how suddenly the whole organization began paying attention to the stock price,"" said Chemical's chairman, Walter Shipley, who at yearend owned 551,950 shares and has options to buy 530,000 more.  TOBACCO  Yes, It's a Drug. Now What?     The F.D.A. has this tricky problem. It has decided that nicotine is an addictive drug, and one that's clearly dangerous; plug those facts into a legal computer and you'd have to ban cigarettes. It can't do that, of course -- smokers would probably burn Washington to the ground (or bury it in ashes). So last week the agency sent some more modest ideas to the White House (given the explosiveness of this issue, it passed the buck). These included banning vending-machine sales, clamping down on sales to minors, and barring ""Joe Camel""-type ads (which seem to have nearly vanished anyway). Even such modest measures face a rough ride, though. Tobacco is ""a legal commodity"" and should be treated as such, said one tobacco-state lawmaker, while another was ""distressed"" and ""annoyed."" . . . Also last week, a glimpse into tobacco history: In 1950, an epidemiologist named Morton Levin wrote one of the first papers to show that smoking causes lung cancer, and campaigned against smoking throughout his career. Dr. Levin just died at 91.  SPENDING IT  Down and Out at Genentech    It's hard to get by on nearly $1 million a year. So to make ends meet -- and considerable ends they must be -- G. Kirk Raab kept borrowing from Genentech, where he happened to be chief executive. Finally, Mr. Raab sought a $2 million personal-loan guarantee from Roche Holdings of Switzerland, even as he was negotiating the sale of his company to Roche -- a deal, by the way, that shareholders say shortchanged them. This was too much for the board, which sent Mr. Raab packing last week. That ended a stormy tenure at this fast-growing company, one marked by strong criticism of its sales practices. A top Genentech sales executive, in fact, is about to go on trial on charges of paying kickbacks to a pediatrician to prescribe Genentech's growth hormone.  INVESTIGATIONS  Blowing a Golden Whistle    It is not, generally, a great idea to bite the hand that feeds you -- especially if that hand belongs to a powerful company like Archer-Daniels-Midland. That company has fed Mark Whitacre very nicely, in fact: as head of the BioProducts division, he is a rising company star. But it's unclear whether that star will keep rising. For last week it turned out that Mr. Whitacre, working with the F.B.I., secretly taped executives' conversations as part of an inquiry into possible price-fixing. Though whistleblowers have popped up in all sorts of places to denounce corporate naughtiness, it's highly unusual for such a high executive to play that role.  TRADE  No Favors From China    Yes, we can talk tough with China all we want -- on human rights, on Taiwan's status. But highmindedness, no matter how virtuous, might also have its costs, for China's sheer bulk gives it indisputable power. Last week, after saying that no decision was due for months, China snubbed Ford and Chrysler to give Mercedes a $1 billion contract to build mini-vans and engines in China, even though Mercedes has never actually built a true passenger mini-van -- you know, with all the cup-holders. Chinese officials denied that rising tensions with Washington had anything to do with the decision, but Detroit has to be wondering. DIPLOMACY  The Next Step in Vietnam    The building of a diplomatic bridge to Vietnam raised emotional issues -- some people saying the move was overdue, others insisting it wouldn't be time till all the missing were accounted for. But put those issues aside for a moment: a big step in healing the wounds will come when goods can flow freely between the nations. And despite last week's opening, that can't happen quite yet. Still needed are a trade agreement and preferred trading status, and even then American companies must struggle to catch up with Asia and Europe to do business in a country with 73 million people, more than France or Britain.  AUTOS  Japan Meets One Trade Goal    Remember that hoopla-laden trade agreement with Japan last month, the one that made the world safe for Lexus owners? No numbers. No specific targets. Just words. But most people have probably forgotten that when George Bush went to Tokyo three years ago, Japan's auto industry set a target of buying $19 billion worth of American parts in the year that ended this past March, twice the previous level. And guess what: Japan did so, and more. Figures out last week showed $19.86 billion in purchases. There's a footnote, though: that figure is total purchases, not imports. Most parts were for Japanese plants here. Japan had set a goal of $4 billion in imported parts, but fell short with just $3.23 billion.  CONSOLIDATION  One Bank, Indivisible    Something strange is going on. One advantage of a national Government -- politics, if possible, aside -- would seem to be the economies of scale it offers in running things. But everyone's been slamming the centralized bureaucracy as a failure. Banking, though, is heading full-blast in the opposite direction. Repeatedly citing ""economies of scale,"" the nation's banks are tripping over themselves in a rush to merge into behemoths. A few weeks ago, First Union said it would buy First Fidelity of Newark.

The decline began when Caldor told analysts that its sales for August in stores open at least a year -- a common measure of retail activity -- could fall 7 percent or more from August 1994. Asserting that its cash reserves were adequate, Caldor, based in Norwalk, Conn., said it was continuing to receive shipments of merchandise without interruption. But an executive at a factoring firm, which specializes in financing for retailers, said he had cut off credit for Caldor merchandise after hearing that two other factors had done so. Caldor's stock ended the day at $10.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, down $1.25 a share. (Dow Jones)"

But many lawyers and experts on the way companies are managed see nothing to cheer about. They say the behavior of the company's board of directors fell far short of what shareholders should expect.   Among their questions are whether the Del board was too dominated by friends and associates of the chief executive, Dan K. Wassong, with no truly independent directors who could step back and act dispassionately. They also asked whether a separate board committee should have guided the company's response. And they wondered why Mr. Wassong was allowed to remain deeply involved in the board's deliberations."

All the signs point this way: inflation is down, the country's budget deficit is under control -- and its central bank has ceased the practice of printing rubles whenever it needed to prop up factories and farms, meaning that the ruble is for the most part holding its value.   While all these signs are encouraging, the economic and political atmospheres remain volatile, threatening stability -- and economists report a growing gap between the rich and poor.  [ Page A1. ] At NBC, Generation X Generates $  While the president of NBC Entertainment would have you believe that the network wants to appeal to all segments -- read, ages -- of the population, his actions tell otherwise. NBC has annointed three young programmers, including 31-year-old Jamie McDermott, left, to run mini-networks of their own. Shepherding such shows as ""Friends,"" ""E.R."" and ""Hope and Gloria,"" the programmers have been a blessing to the network, which leads all three networks by a wide margin in ratings among relatively young adults with household incomes greater than $60,000 -- a segment that advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach.  [ D7. ] A Force to Contend With, Again  Ken Olsen, the founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, is back. At 69, Mr. Olsen, who was forced to resign from Digital in 1992 after the company suffered heavy losses, is competing with Andersen Consulting, E.D.S., and I.B.M. to help businesses modernize their computer systems. He believes corporations would do well to impose the same discipline on networks of PC's that they reserve for their mainframe and minicomputers.  [ D5. ] Janet Jackson Does the Impossible  Thanks to video technology, the singer finds herself running across the arms of the statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro and sitting on top of the Easter Island monuments -- even though she never left the airplane hangar in California where she taped the video for her latest single, ""Runaway."" By imposing Ms. Jackson's image into two-dimensional photographs of the locales, the production studio Hollywood Digital spent one-fourth of what it would have spent traveling to the locations shown in the video. And those savings don't even take into consideration the idea of hoisting the pop rock star to the heavenly heights she appears to roam in Rio.  [ D7. ] San Francisco Examiner in Flux  The Hearst Corporation, which owns the 108-year-old evening paper in San Francisco, is reportedly in talks to close The Examiner and take over management of The San Francisco Chronicle -- the city's bigger, morning newspaper. Since 1965, the papers have operated jointly, sharing printing, distribution and other business operations. But they have maintained separate editorial staffs. They have split profits, or losses, too. For the current year, losses are estimated to be $10 million to $12 million. Both newspapers have been losing circulation, with The Chronicle down to 110,000.  [ D8. ] Former Intel Engineer Arrested  The F.B.I. arrested William Gaede, charging the former Intel software engineer with mail fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property. The Federal crimes of which Mr. Gaede is accused are related to the theft of millions of dollars worth of production secrets for Intel's Pentium microprocessor.  [ D2. ]"

Don't Quit Your Job,"Q. I have two inventions that my wife thinks I should try to patent. But my lawyer says it's only worth the $15,000 in fees if I plan to do something with them. I'm inclined to listen to my wife since she bought I.B.M. at $55 last year, and look where it is now! D. JACKSON Cincinnati A. Love your wife but listen to your lawyer. Spousal stock-picking skills play no part in this unique and complicated field.  Having invented a nation, Americans take for granted products like the ubiquitous zipper, parking meter, safety pin and nail-polish remover. Rarely do we stop to reflect that someone had to invent them and that, for every patented invention that clicked, at least 98 bombed. The reason is not lack of merit, pizazz or even usefulness, but the inventor's inability to commercialize his bright idea, says Richard C. Levy, who has 85 inventions -- like his Wayne's World VCR board game -- under his belt and wrote the comprehensive ""Inventor's Desktop Companion"" (Visible Ink, $24.95).   Mr. Levy's creativity is squarely in the American tradition. Since April 10, 1790, when George Washington set up what eventually became the Patent and Trademark Office, more than 5.4 million patents have been granted. Among them: Eli Whitney's cotton gin, Thomas Edison's incandescent light bulb, Clarence Birdseye's flash-frozen veggies and Bette Nesmith Graham's Liquid Paper typewriter correction fluid.  For the examiners in the Patent Office, these and all other patents must pass three tests to gain the 20 years of protection from intellectual poachers that a patent represents. The inventions must be new, useful and not obvious. While non-obviousness is a very difficult concept and can be a high hurdle, the other two often aren't that tough.  Back in the 1890's, notes Bruce Felton, who is compiling a compendium of bad ideas, Martin Goetze received patent 560,351 for a cosmetic device to endow users with a temporary dimple -- a precious asset in Victorian society. And consider patent 5,163,447, issued in 1992 to Paul Lyons, for a condom with a tiny transducer similar to those in singing greeting cards. On contact, it breaks into a rousing rendition of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture or whatever else has been programmed.   But inventing is hardly easy; even the best get discouraged. In 1878, after a demonstration in Paris of his phonograph, Mr. Edison was accused of ventriloquism by Jean Bouillaud, a member of the French Academy of Sciences. ""It is quite impossible that the noble organs of human speech could be replaced by ignoble, senseless metal,"" the Frenchman declared. Two years later, a depressed Edison told his assistant, Sam Insull, ""The phonograph is not of any commercial value.""   His wasn't the only clouded crystal ball. As recently as 1977, Kenneth Olsen, the founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, told the World Future Society, ""There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.""   Blind alleys abound, too. Norman Larsen, a chemist, tried 39 different formulas of an anti-rust lubricant until he hit one that worked. The result: WD-40, the aerosol spray which stands for Water Displacement/40th try, now a $100 million product. (Musical satirist Victor Borge tells the story of his Danish uncle who hoped to strike it rich in the soda-pop business. All his attempts came to naught -- first there was One-Up, then Two-Up, then Three-up, etcetera. Mr. Borge's uncle quit after Six-Up went flat.)  And all that, as Mr. Levy says, is the easy part. Filing for a patent -- last year 113,268 were issued, 57 percent to Americans -- is described in detail by Judy Ryder in ""Turning Your Great Idea into a Great Success"" (Peterson's, $14.95).   Consider the patent search, which hopeful inventors must conduct to prove their creation is original. There are three ways to go. Retain a patent lawyer -- the cost will be at least $1,000 -- and make sure he or she is both knowledgeable in your field of innovation and registered with the Patent Office. Or hire a patent search firm, which is less expensive. Or do the search yourself, and be prepared to spend a lot of time at the patent office in Arlington, Va., or at one of the more than 80 Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries scattered around the country.  More complexity: for inventors in midcreation who worry that someone may beat them to the punch, temporary protections are available. For $10, buy a disclosure document that functions as a two-year claim stake, or get a provisional patent application, good for one year. Both should keep poachers at bay while you perfect your invention.  With a patent in hand, you must decide whether to make the product yourself or to license its manufacture. Licensing lowers your financial risk and frees you to go on to the next invention. When Dorothy Rodgers, wife of Richard Rodgers, the composer, invented the Jonny-Mop back in the 1950's, she licensed the toilet scrubber to a large maker of packaged goods and became a lot richer.   The drawbacks of licensing include loss of control of the invention and of its development and marketing. Another risk is selecting the wrong licensee. By the time you discover the mismatch, it may be too late to retrieve your invention.   And all potential Edisons must be wary of unscrupulous marketing companies whose real expertise is in parting inventors from their money. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who has been investigating patent fraud, says about 25,000 inventions are ripped off this way every year. The most common ploy: asking for upfront appraisal fees and then disappearing -- often with enough product information to make unpatented knock-offs. Most inventors have neither the money or stamina to seek court relief, according to the Intellectual Property Owners Association (202) 466-2396.   The Federal Trade Commission is also cracking down on such scams. It has logged thousands of complaints on its hot line and has taken action against some fraudulent invention marketers (202) 326-2222.  Be particularly suspicious of demands for upfront payments, experts say. ""You invested your ingenuity, time and money to create and protect your invention,"" Mr. Levy said. ""The marketers are obligated, in turn, to invest their ingenuity, time and money to find it a home in return for a percentage of future royalties."" By paying someone at the start you remove the incentive to deliver the goods, he maintains.   At least there still are patents to be had. In 1899, Charles H. Duell, then head of the patent office, advised President McKinley to abolish the agency. Everything that could be invented had been invented, Mr. Duell explained. But McKinley was assassinated before he could act on the recommendation.

Boatmen's, the largest banking company in Missouri and 30th in the nation, has about 500 offices in 9 states in the Midwest and Southwest. Fourth Financial is the largest banking company in Kansas and one of the largest in Oklahoma.  [ Page 36. ] A Start-Up Hopes to Develop Breakthrough in Heart Surgery  A Silicon Valley start-up named Heartport said it had developed a technology to allow coronary bypass surgery to be performed through a tiny incision between the ribs, promising far less pain and trauma than current methods that split open the breastbone. But the advance could be two years away from being generally available.    Analysts say Heartport's technology could cut the cost of a coronary bypass -- which can be as high as $50,000 -- by $10,000 or more. The development needs F.D.A. approval, but investment bankers are already scrambling to underwrite an initial public offering.  [ 34. ] Bond Yield Falls to 6.70%  Treasury securities surged in price, cutting the yield on the 30-year bond to its lowest level in six weeks. Traders said the gains were driven by follow-through buying from Thursday and were bolstered as short sellers scrambled to cover their positions.  [ 36. ] Fed May Lower Rates Soon  Federal Reserve policy makers gave Alan Greenspan the power to cut short-term interest rates this summer. He didn't take up the offer, but the discretion given him strongly suggests that the Fed may lower interest rates in the coming months.  [ 35. ] Home Sales Sprinted in July  Home resales surged 5 percent in July to an annual rate of 3.99 million units, their highest annual rate in more than a year, as mortgage rates fell, an industry group said. But the market may have peaked.  [ 35. ] Harsh Words for Honda  A Federal judge criticized Honda's role in a scandal in which company executives solicited bribes from dealers. The judge, who sentenced former executives, said the company ""could well be accused of being negligent,"" but not criminally culpable, for ignoring the scandal's warning signs. The comments seemed likely to bolster the more than two dozen lawsuits brought by dealers against Honda.  [ 35. ] Dollar Skids in Turbulent Day  The dollar fell against the German mark after Finance Minister Alain Madelin of France resigned, suggesting that there was dissension in the conservative Chirac Government. The political uncertainty caused dealers to unload dollars as well as French francs, as they rushed to buy marks.  [ 32. ] In futures trading, prices of coffee, gasoline and corn all rose.  [ 32. ] Geico Takeover Lifts Stocks  Stocks rose, led by banking and insurance companies, but technology shares fell. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.78 points, to 4,601.4, its biggest gain in almost two weeks. For the week, the average slipped 16.2 points. Stocks took strength from the plans for Warren Buffett's investment company to buy the rest of the insurer Geico for $2.3 billion. Microsoft slipped for a third consecutive day, losing 1 3/4 to 94 3/8 , and I.B.M. fell 1 to 103 7/8. [ 37. ] Crisis Claims 9 Russian Banks  Russian banks have begun to default on credit obligations, but the crisis may ultimately prove to be healthy if it weeds out weak institutions. Overnight lending rates have soared. The crisis began unfolding in July, when the Government limited ruble speculation by banks, cutting off a lucrative source of profits. And in the last week or so, nine banks failed to meet some of their credit obligations.  [ 34. ] F.A.A.

That worry helped move 60 Republicans to join 168 Democrats last week in voting to retain stricter limits on media ownership. The vote scaled back a House bill that clears away regulations in every other corner of the communications industry. For their part, media executives say they have little choice but to consolidate into giant companies that produce and distribute programming.  [ Page A1. ] ABC Leader Sees Strengths  Known in the television industry as a deft handler of business relationships, Robert A. Iger, the president of Capital Cities/ABC, faces a new challenge in his new, mercurial boss, Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney. But Mr. Iger seems to be focusing on areas in which the combined companies can do better than they could have as separate entities, like international expansion and joint programming. Mr. Iger also hopes that ABC can tap Disney's expertise in areas like theme parks, stores and toys. As an example, he might seek to build ESPN network virtual-reality theaters to give audiences the sense that they are on the field.  [ D6. ] Disney Purchase Inspires Fear  Disney's purchase of ABC has major movie studios and other producers of prime-time television programs shaking. Will access to ABC -- a vital route to the lucrative syndication of a show -- be sharply cut for non-Disney productions? Will studios be forced to focus on distribution as much as content? Disney has moved to quell some fears, but skeptics abound.  [ D6. ] CBS Deal's Unusual Terms  CBS could accept another bidder without having to pay Westinghouse a $150 million breakup fee, according to terms of the deal disclosed on Friday. And under certain circumstances, Westinghouse would have to pay CBS if the deal falls apart.  [ D6. ] A New Budget Plan Emerges  The White House is considering a strategy that would try to rally a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans around an alternative to the Republican plan to produce a balanced budget in several years.  [ A1. ] Virtual Reality's Starter Home  The first store in the United States devoted to sales of virtual-reality equipment is in Indianapolis, wedged between a pizza parlor and Laundromat. The technology, which combines headsets, gloves and other equipment with computer programs, allows users to feel as if they are inside a computer-generated landscape. So far, nearly all the store's sales have been of low-price accessories like magazines and T-shirts. But some analysts calculate that the virtual-reality market -- now estimated at less than $90 million a year in consumer sales -- will explode into a $6 billion business by the end of the century. And chain stores like Incredible Universe and Comp USA are stocking virtual-reality games and accessories in preparation.  [ D5. ] Powerful 'Soul Train'  Just as it did when Afro hair styles and platform shoes ruled in the 1970's, ""Soul Train"" continues to pull its weight. The last remaining dance show on broadcast television is about to enter its 25th season, making it the longest-lasting program now in first-run syndication. And it remains under the direction of its creator, Don Cornelius.  [ D7. ] Microsoft's Other System  Windows 95 is getting all the attention, but the big winner at Microsoft could be Windows NT, which is used on corporate computer networks. The company is hoping that Windows 95 will lure customers and software developers to its corporate system, a market in which Microsoft has been trailing.  [ D5. ]"

But if you understand what produced the results, it can help in forecasting.   Nowhere is that more clear than when a small mutual fund has got hot. It pays to learn not just the percentage gains the fund has racked up, but to figure out how many dollars were involved, and what investment decisions really produced the gains. Maybe the manager was good; maybe lucky. But if a fund has grown rapidly, a strategy that once worked may be impossible to repeat, a fact that many investors learn only after they have leaped into the fund."

The digital effects group at Digital Domain in California rendered most of the elements electronically and then combined them for the movie scene. What made the launch especially difficult to create were the smoke, fire and ice that artists had to simulate. the lifelike rendering elements bodes well for the entire business of simulated photo realism: advertising flight simulators and virtual-reality surgery are among the area that will benfit from practical alternatives to real-world experiences, but only when compters can routinely process complex polygons to match the look of reality. TY AHMAD-TAYLOR -- How it was done   The artists began with a helicopter photograph of a launch pad. They embellished the original, adding grass, shadow and a digital replica of the Saturn 5 launch pad by using a computerized painting program to alter the photograph   For two large smoke effects. Kevin S. Mack, the digital effects art director. drew several plumes of smoke and layered copies of the plumes on top of one another. Each layer was then morphed, or distorted, to make the entire smoke image look real.   The creation of the rocket's launch flame and smoke, as well as the coolant ice that slides off the rocket, was more complicated that the large plumes. The flame, for example, was drawn underneath the rocket as a three-dimensional image. Artists used what is called a computer particle system to cause the flames to shimmy and vibrate in space like real flame.   The sequence was created at 24 frames a second, and each frame was altered separately. Some of the more complicated frames took a computer two hours each to complete. During a five-month period at the peak of production, Digital Domain used more than 100 artists.   The final scene, shown, below, was put together using a process called composting, where the smoke plumes, exhaust, rocket model, scenery and launch pad were integrated electronically. Other applcations  It is extremely hard, if not impossible, to show realistic computer-generated ice, fog, flame or even clouds in real time. Flight simulators, for example, like the NASA aviation training program shows below, render multi-faceted elements like clouds as crude, chunky shapes.   W. Jeff Morgan of Graphic Simulations in Dallas uses a technique in his simulation programs that alters the density of a cloud depending on the pilot's proximity to that cloud, but concedes that personal computer processor speed is too slow to make realistic clouds possible.   Artists can use the painstaking particle system process shows above in ""Apollo 13"" to generate snow, rain and bubbles under water in films and commercials. The effect is more convincing than conventional animation or large models, said Scott A. Ross, chief executive of Digital Domain.   This commercial, put together by Lintas, Campbell & Ewald and Digital Domain, features a sport-utility vehicle moving seamlessly from a rainy environment to a snowy one and then to dry pavement. The camera never cuts from the vehicle, and the ability to animate the various rain and snow elements by computer help to portray a seamless journey through impossible conditions."

An average or even slightly better than average grain and soybean harvest is still possible, analysts say, but shortfalls seem more likely.   Problems with this year's crop already are translating into higher prices for livestock feed, costlier ingredients for food and beverage companies and higher prices for industrial consumers of agricultural products. Little of the expense has filtered through to consumers, but that could change if continued weather problems hamper the current harvest of winter wheat and the progress of crops planted this spring."

While the flights benefit business and leisure travelers equally, the real motivation behind many of the flights is to make flying more convenient for business travelers, who pay the highest fares.   Northwest Airlines, for example, is so determined to accommodate its business travelers to Asia that on some flights it chooses to carry fewer leisure passengers and less cargo. While it flies in the face of conventional aviation wisdom to leave passengers behind on planes that are not full, Northwest's purpose is to eliminate stops en route that otherwise would be necessary for planes carrying heavier loads."

The obvious question, from a 43-year-old Bellevue patient with AIDS, was this: ""Where will the poor people go for medical care?"" The mayor's panel, though, insisted that the poor will get better care at revamped hospitals or at private medical centers.

Or so Maytag thought when, in 1991, it shut a vending-machine plant in West Virginia and opened one in South Carolina. Workers say Maytag assured them this would never happen, and the workers -- first one, then a class-action parade -- decided this was a legal promise and sued. And last week Maytag settled the case by agreeing to pay $16.5 million -- it was ""risk avoidance,"" mind you; the company remained pure as a new-laundered sheet. Lawyers, bless their billable souls, will devour $5 million of that, but that still leaves a tidy sum for 800 workers.  ENTERTAINMENT  Rocking Hollywood's Boat  Think of Hollywood as a huge rowboat, managing a delicate balance even under its heavy load of ego and money -- mighty agents on one side, mighty studios on the other. Then, without warning, a giant among giants leaps from one side to the other, sending everyone else scampering for equilibrium. That's basically what happened last week when Michael Ovitz, agent to the gods and just about everyone else, decided that, well, working for a studio might not be that bad. MCA hadn't worked out, so the buzz (sorry, but Hollywoodspeak is de rigueur) was that nothing would shake him from Creative Artists. But then Disney came calling -- its new jewel, ABC, in hand -- and Mr. Ovitz couldn't resist, even though he'll play second fiddle to Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman. You can bet he'll be a loud second fiddle. GUIDING NATURE  Writing E-Mail in the Sand  Beaches are big business -- people go to unholy lengths to sit on them and fry, and pay unholy prices for shelter and hot dogs nearby. But only God can make a beach -- well, God and the Army Corps of Engineers. The big difference: when engineers do it, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And when God then washes away man's sand, there's hell to pay -- and more sand to cart in. Take, say, New Jersey. Man built beaches recently at vast expense -- Federal money that miraculously flowed freely -- but (of all the nerve!) water barged in and took much of it away. And so the debate heats up, with some insisting that, yes, man can shape the earth, but other heretical souls (they probably don't even like running barefoot on the sand) talking about pouring tax dollars into the ocean.  REGULATION  A Tobacco-Country Judge  The battle is joined. The F.D.A. wants to regulate the sale and promotion of cigarettes -- because it wants fewer teen-agers to start smoking. The tobacco industry doesn't like that idea, possibly because if people don't get the habit young, they usually don't get it. So the industry sued, and by all signs got just the arbiter it would want last week -- a North Carolina judge who had ruled pro-tobacco in a suit involving the E.P.A. and had, as a lawyer, defended an R.J. Reynolds heir. Why North Carolina? It's ""the only jurisdiction that makes any sense,"" Reynolds said. But the head of an anti-smoking group said, ""Among Southern lawyers, it's called home cooking, helping out the friends and neighbors.""  ROCKEFELLER CENTER  What Price Location Now?  What next? Just when you thought you'd figured out who owns Rockefeller Center -- no simple matter, in case you've missed it all; the overlapping trusts and groups and holding companies create a dazzling financial maze -- here come two more investors battling for a piece of it. First was Sam Zell of Chicago, who, like others drawn to the fabled towers, is all gaga about ""location, location, location,"" a rule he learned ""when my daddy put me on his knee."" (Well, at least his daddy didn't say, ""Plastics."") And the very next day this bankruptcy-smudged landmark got a rival offer, from Tishman Speyer Properties of New York. Don't even ask what the ownership chart might look like now; the family tree of British royalty is a sapling in comparison.  THE FED  A Rate Cut? Probably Not  Oh, yes -- interest rates. Is the Federal Reserve going to give borrowers another break, as it did a month or so ago, when it cut rates slightly after that endless string of increases? The Fed gathers on Tuesday, but people who think they know such things expect no more rate cuts just yet. True, official rates still hover farther than usual above inflation -- which the Fed is slapping itself gleefully on the back for taming. But Fed officials seem to think things are going just fine, with a sharp rise in housing starts last week just the latest bit of strength. Or perhaps it's just too hot for them to think about anything so strenuous as tinkering with those all-powerful rates. Maybe in September.  EQUALITY  Women of Value  Life is unfair: Any 12-year-old denied extra dessert or a new computer will tell you that. But for the world's women, life is truly unfair -- as a United Nations report out last week made vividly and statistically clear. Among the findings: 70 percent of the world's poor are women, and women hold just 14 percent of top managerial jobs. Not that women don't do their fair share of the world's work -- far from it. One of the study's more intriguing findings is the extreme economic undervaluation of women's work. They pull their weight; they just don't get paid for it.  WORK FORCE  Employees, by Another Name  No one wants employees anymore. Employees want pesky things like health benefits. (Health benefits?) They want companies to be loyal to them. (A quaint idea.) You have to pay payroll taxes so they can get stuff like Social Security. It's all such a nuisance! More and more, companies prefer ""independent contractors"" -- not too independent, mind you -- and the ranks of such semi-employees have soared with all the layoffs lately. But there are rules about who can be called a contractor -- rules, no doubt, often stretched to, and past, the limit -- and last week Texas A&M University admitted that it had illegally paid 400 farm workers as contractors, cheating the Government out of $86,000 in payroll taxes. The Republicans, meanwhile, have a solution: they're pushing a bill that would liberalize the use of contractors."

After all, Congress is now poised to dismantle the whole Federal regulatory apparatus. But even if the Environmental Protection Agency disappeared tomorrow, public concern and corporate commitments would remain powerful goads to better environmental performance. And smart firms will keep squeezing more product out of less raw material and energy -- a hard-nosed business imperative with healthy environmental side effects.  Unfortunately, companies can't make smart decisions when standard accounting practices force them to fly blind. Accounting-as-usual shows what a company spends on environmental compliance and cleanup, but that is only the tip of the iceberg. Sums spent on salary, labor, permits and equipment for environmental purposes show up somewhere in the ledgers, but they are usually scattered around arbitrarily in ""nonenvironmental"" accounts, hiding the connections between a particular business decision and its environmental tab."

Members voted 305 to 117 for vastly reduced regulations on everything from cable television to local and long-distance telephone services. The bill would give the Baby Bells something they have long sought: the right to enter the long-distance market.     But in a setback for the television networks, House Democrats curbed some of the legislation's strongest elements of deregulation, winning key amendments to limit media ownership and to mandate that all new television sets include technology that would allow parents to block out programs with violence or sexual content.  [ Page 1. ] Having passed a spending bill and the telecommunications bill, the House adjourned for a monthlong recess in a wave of partisan sparring.  [ 1. ] Edward J. Markey, an archetypal liberal Democrat, fought the conservative tide and won approval of two important changes in the House bill, relating to program coding and station ownership.  [ 32. ] Tighter Rules for Lobbyists  President Clinton said he would soon tighten the rules for contacts between lobbyists and the Executive Branch and chided Speaker Newt Gingrich for the House's ""delay, debate and division"" on the measure.  [ 9. ] Suit Dismissed on Nasdaq Trading  A suit against Nasdaq market makers was dismissed by a Federal judge, but both sides said they expected the plaintiffs to refile it soon. The State of Louisiana and some 30 private investors argued that big Wall Street firms had benefited from wide price spreads in the stocks that they bought and sold to private investors. The defendants included dozens of firms.  [ 35. ] Rail Streamlining Is Predicted  Union Pacific and Southern Pacific Rail executives expressed confidence that their union would promote greater efficiency and service. Securities analysts largely agreed, suggesting shippers would benefit from lower rates to come.  [ 33. ] Atlantic Bank Fined $1.1 Million  Atlantic Bank of New York was fined $1.1 million after it pleaded guilty to helping its clients avoid declaring large cross-border transactions. The bank is a unit of the National Bank of Greece and has strong ties to the Greek-American community.  [ 34. ] Phone Strike Deadline Near  Four of eight regional telephone companies face strike threats by the Communications Workers of America if contracts are not reached by midnight. The 164,000 workers involved include operators, repair personnel, technicians and other employees. The companies are: Bell Atlantic, Ameritech, Bell South and Pacific Telesis.  [ 7. ] Recycling Plant for New York  Pratt Industries of Australia agreed to build a $250 million waste paper recycling plant in Staten Island, which will be the first of its kind in New York.  [ 22. ] Sweatshops Are Flourishing  At least one-fifth of the garment workers in Los Angeles are toiling in unregulated, sweatshop conditions, labor officials, economists and union organizers said. Experts said that employers take advantage of the workers' legal status, naivete and cultural alienation, despite a host of regulations intended to shut down the companies.  [ 6. ]   Stocks Drift Lower  Blue-chip stocks sagged in lethargic trading, although technology issues rebounded. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 17.96 points, closing at 4,683.46, which was off 32.05 points for the week. Walt Disney gave up some of its gains from earlier in the week, slipping 1 3/8, to 58. Oil stocks dropped on prospects for lower earnings.

There, men wearing only bikini briefs stand in the water, turning it coffee-colored as they wash and sift the clay soil, inspecting the leftover stones for the glimmer of a diamond.   Everywhere are teen-agers on patrol with AK-47's. The people in charge wear Government uniforms. A little north of here, the scene is the same, only instead of the Government, rebel Unita soldiers control the area."

Another couple, Anton and Mira Homa, looked for a house that would be near a school for their two boys."

Malone was easy. But until last week, few people outside the media industry knew just how tenacious a negotiator the cable television entrepreneur could be. For almost a week, Mr. Malone has been the sole roadblock to Time Warner's proposed merger with the Turner Broadcasting System. Although Ted Turner, the chairman of Turner Broadcasting, supports the deal, it is Mr. Malone who needs to be mollified.   As the chief executive of Tele-Communications, Mr. Malone controls the company's 21 percent stake in Turner Broadcasting, worth about $2.34 billion. While Mr. Malone has no legal right to block a deal, neither Mr. Turner nor Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner, wants to do the merger without his imprimatur. Not only have Mr. Turner and Mr. Malone worked together for years, but Tele-Communications is a major distributor of Turner's cable services as well as Time Warner's Home Box Office movie channel."
