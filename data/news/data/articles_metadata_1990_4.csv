The agreement, signed last week, calls for Brig. Gen. Rami Dotan to return $10 million in bribes and kickbacks he is charged with having accepted while heading the Defense Ministry's department of military acquisitions in New York in 1984-85. General Dotan was arrested in October.    He also agreed to supply investigators with the names of other people involved in the scheme, Israel radio said. In exchange, it said, no charges will be brought against General Dotan's wife, who was also accused of involvement.   The scandal startled Israel's military establishment and raised concern that it might jeopardize the $1.8 billion in United States military aid that Israel receives each year.    In announcing the plea bargain, the chief military prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Amnon Strashnov, dismissed suggestions that it could limit full disclosure of the corruption.   ""There is no attempt to hide or to cover up anything here,"" he said."

Council Returns to Israel Issue Today,"  The Security Council is to resume discussions Monday on a resolution on Palestinians living in territories occupied by Israel. The United States narrowly succeeded in delaying a vote on the measure over the weekend.   The delay has given Washington more time to try to change the proposed resolution. American diplomats oppose it because they believe its passage would weaken their demand that President Saddam Hussein unconditionally withdraw his troops from Kuwait; at the same time, American efforts to resist the measure are complicated by a reluctance to allow a wedge to be driven between Washington and its Arab allies in the gulf crisis.     In its current form, the resolution would give United Nations protection to Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied territories. It also endorses a plan to convene an international Middle East peace conference to resolve the region's problems at an unspecified future date. Passage of such a resolution now, the United States says, could be seen by President Hussein as a weakening of the American insistence that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait without any linkage of its withdrawal to other issues."

Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin met for two hours, an independent news agency, Interfax, reported. The conversation between the two leaders was conducted in a ""businesslike, principled atmosphere,"" Interfax said, without quoting any officials.   It was their first substantive meeting since an attempt at reconciliation over economic policy broke down late last summer. Mr. Yeltsin, whom Mr. Gorbachev ousted from the Communist Party Politburo in 1986, has criticized the Soviet President for the Government's slow pace of economic change.    Among the issues discussed today by the two leaders were the Russian republic's role in possible radical economic reforms and ""urgent measures"" to provide food and consumer goods, Interfax said.    After their private meeting, Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin were joined by the Soviet Prime Minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, and two officials from the Russian republic, Vice President Ruslan I.

If United Airlines completes its deal for the routes, as expected, it will emerge as a much heftier competitor for the less robust T.W.A., notes John Clair, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. But that might also leave American Airlines, which has expressed interest in Pan Am's routes, looking for other London connections -- and T.W.A. has them, and might sell them.   ""This both increases T.W.A.'s opportunities and its risks,"" Mr. Clair said. While he gives Mr. Icahn high marks for handling such situations deftly, he added, ""What is good for T.W.A. may not be good for bondholders."" One thing, at least, can be said for the bonds: Somebody at T.W.A. likes them. T.W.A. disclosed it bought up various bonds with a face value of $213 million in the second quarter."

Today all that came back to haunt her, with a bitter political challenge from Michael Heseltine, a pro-European figure she had driven out of her Cabinet in 1986.   A handsome, leonine 57-year-old who has been planning to be Prime Minister ever since his student days at Oxford, Mr. Heseltine openly called upon the 372 Conservative members of Parliament to overthrow Mrs. Thatcher as party leader and Prime Minister in a closed ballot set for next Tuesday. He had parted ways with Mrs. Thatcher in 1986, when he abruptly left her Cabinet.  Britain's Role in Europe     On the surface, the issue is the two-decades-long British argument over whether to be a full-fledged partner in the European Community, driving ahead toward political and monetary union as Mr. Heseltine and other ""Europeanists"" want, or to slow the process down to preserve the centuries-old hard-won prerogatives of parliamentary democracy, as Mrs. Thatcher insists."

""The new budget is a step, but I don't think fiscal discipline has been re-established at all,"" said William H. Gross, a managing director of the Pacific Investment Management Company, a Newport Beach, Calif., money management firm with a portfolio of more than $16 billion in fixed-income investments. ""Unless we can exert some discipline on spending, rather than taxation, we are probably not going to make much headway in reducing the deficit.""   No Comment From Fed     As is their wont, neither the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, nor other officials of the nation's central bank would speak on or off the record about their intentions on interest rates. Telephone calls to Mr. Greenspan and governors of the Federal Reserve on Friday found no one who would comment on Federal Reserve policies and how the budget agreement might affect them.    But through the summer and into the fall, Mr. Greenspan had offered Congress a carrot -- a drop in short-term interest rates -- if the credit markets responded positively to a budget package.    The message struck a chord with market participants, and in the last week short-term money market interest rates moved down in anticipation of a budget agreement and a subsequent reduction in the overnight Federal funds rate, the market rate controlled most directly by the Fed. The funds rate -- the overnight rate on bank loans-- has hovered around 8 percent since July.   Drop in Prime Rate Unlikely     While welcome, a minor cut in the funds rate would probably not lead to a decline in the prime lending rate charged by commercial banks, or in other prime-based consumer borrowing rates. With poor balance sheets, analysts said, commercial banks were not likely to consider lowering the prime rate, currently at 10 percent, until the funds rate fell to 7 1/2 percent.    Yet, even as short-term rates slipped, bond yields, which are the ultimate indicator of how a long-term budget package is judged by market participants, have not budged.    By the end of last week, yields on 8 1/8 percent two-year Treasury notes, securities which are very sensitive to changes in Fed policy, had fallen to 7.76 percent, well under the funds rate. But yields on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds were stuck at 8.76 percent.    ""The Fed might be able to cut the Federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percentage point without upsetting the market,"" said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. ""But people who think there will be a big payoff on interest rates based on this budget package are in for a disappointment.""    The Fed will be reluctant to move faster because market participants, especially long-term investors, see little reason to believe the budget package will generate the advertised $500 billion in savings over the next five years.    Moreover, with the dollar under pressure and fears about inflation still strong, the Fed would be running a substantial risk of pushing up long-term rates if it quickly cut short-term rates by more than a quarter of a percentage point, the analysts argued.   Economic Reports Awaited     A signal from the Fed that it has moved the funds rate lower may come almost immediately, but in order to calm nerves in the long-term bond market, analysts said, the Fed might well delay its move until after a string of important economic reports are released this week.    Those reports, coupled with the announcement late last week that a key measure of consumer confidence had plummeted in October, are likely to reassure bond investors that an easing of Fed policy is justified on economic grounds.    This week will provide a preliminary reading on how the economy fared in the third quarter and reports from the naton's purchasing managers and the Labor Department on how the fourth quarter began.   Rise in Consumption Spending     The Commerce Department's preliminary report on third-quarter growth could well show growth that is considerably above the increase of four-tenths of a percent recorded in the second quarter. But most analysts said a rise in third-quarter output should not be interpreted as a sign that the economy was regaining momentum. Much of the increase will probably be from a rise in consumption expenditures, a figure that tends to increase in the third quarter.   ""I would hope people will look past the consumption number in the third quarter G.N.P. report,"" said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. ""Consumption was stronger than it was in the second quarter, but on a year-over-year basis it continues to weaken.""    Dimming the outlook for the fourth quarter was the announcement late last week of a record drop in the Conference Board's monthly survey of consumer confidence, which in October fell to its lowest level since the 1982 recession.   Gayle Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board and an analyst who says the economy will avoid a recession, acknowledged that the results of the survey were troubling. ""I would now be inclined to reduce my estimates on consumer spending somewhat,"" she said, ""but I think this number has more to do with disenchantment over the budget negotiations than with economics.""  Manufacturers and Jobs     Other analysts are not so sure. A report, due Thursday, from the nation's purchasing managers, will probably show that conditions among large manufacturers deteriorated further in October. October employment data from the Labor Department, expected the following day, will probably be weak, too.    ""The data will show that the fourth quarter started off on a very weak note,"" Mr. Fine said. ""I have no problem with a forecast which shows economic output declining in the fourth quarter.""    Mr. Jordan of First Interstate said that weakness in the economy would ultimately lead to an aggressive easing in policy by the Federal Reserve. But constraints on the Fed will not be lifted until the crisis in the Middle East is resolved, he added, and the dollar regains some bouyancy.    ""If they were not constrained by the Middle East crisis, the Fed would have already done more to help the economy,"" he said. ""Assuming there is a solution, we think the funds rate will come down to 7 percent next year."""

As a result, ITT Financial has had to increase its provisions for loan loss, which in turn is affecting the company's profits, S.&P. noted.

Profits in the quarter were $260.7 million, or 91 cents a share, up from $238.3 million, or 83 cents a share, last year. Revenue jumped 15.5 percent, to $3.12 billion, from $2.70 billion for the third quarter last year. It was the 55th straight quarter of record sales and earnings at the world's largest brewery.    August Busch 3d, chairman and president, said beer sales had been helped by the introduction of two brands, Bud Dry and Busch Light, in the early part of the year.   ""We continue to be extremely pleased with our beer company's performance during 1990,"" Mr. Busch said. Sales of beer to wholesalers were up 4.8 percent from last year's third quarter, the highest volume gain in the industry, the company said.   Mr. Busch said higher profits at two other Busch companies -- Campbell Taggart bakery and the Metal Container Corporation -- also helped profits in the quarter.   But he cautioned that the weak economy, higher gasoline prices and tougher competition have resulted in lower 1990 attendance at the company's Busch Gardens and Sea World theme parks. The low attendance and lower profits will probably continue into 1991, Mr. Busch said.   The company's stock slipped 62.5 cents today, to $38, on the New York Stock Exchange."

The main businesses of the three companies will be real estate, petroleum and rail service.   ""In our view, the values of our significant and diversified assets, especially our real estate and petroleum properties, have not been reflected fully in Santa Fe Pacific's stock price,"" said Robert Krebs, the chairman of the company.   He said that separation into three companies, which had been under consideration since April, would ""place a spotlight on the values inherent in those companies.""    However, Graeme Lidgerwood, a railroad analyst for First Boston, said that in the near term the total value of the three pieces could end up trading at about $12, which would be lower than the company's current stock price.    Santa Fe closed yesterday at $13 a share, down 25 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Ms. Lidgerwood said that the minerals subsidiary had made significant gold discoveries and that the railroad had some valuable track it could sell and was taking steps to increase operating efficiency and cut costs.    The main problem, she said, was with the real estate company, the Catellus Development Corporation, which has a land portfolio of two million acres.   The spinoffs were put into place by the Santa Fe board, which yesterday approved a special dividend to common stockholders consisting of Santa Fe's interests in the company's real estate and energy subsidiaries.   Holders of Santa Fe common stock as of Nov. 29 will get one share of common stock of Santa Fe Energy Resources for every 3.3 shares of Santa Fe common stock, and one share of Catellus for every four shares of Santa Fe common stock.    The value of Santa Fe Pacific's stock has dropped considerably since June, when it was trading at $23.    Ms. Lidgerwood said the spinoffs were the culmination of a long effort by Mr. Krebs to keep the company from being taken over after it was put in play by an offer from the Henley Group in 1987.    After a series of steps to ward off takeovers and placate shareholders, which included a $30-a-share special dividend, Santa Fe has had to carry considerable debt and make large interest payments."

Baker 3d's weeklong talks with America's main partners in the coalition against Iraq has demonstrated that there are some very obvious differences over when, and even if, a military operation should be carried out against Iraq, senior Administration officials said today.    Indeed, if there is one overarching lesson from Mr. Baker's eight-country tour, it is that the coalition against Iraq remains solid -- as long as the military option is not imminent. But the closer Washington edges toward using military force, the more the small differences that now exist between coalition partners could develop into major cracks.   Administration officials say they do not think President Bush has decided whether or not to go to war. But his decision to send more than 150,000 more troops to the Arabian Peninsula was interpreted by American marines in Saudi Arabia today as a strong signal that an offensive was growing nearer.  [ Page 14. ] Making 'All Options Credible'     Mr. Baker in effect acknowledged the problems of maintaining the coalition at his closing news conference in Paris, after his talks with President Francois Mitterrand, when he said, ""As we wrap up this trip, I feel that we have a very strong consensus on our collective aims, and on the need particularly to resist partial solutions and on the need to work together and stay together in this coalition and on the need to make all of our options credible, if we are to succeed."""

The specter of an attack on Israel has been especially troubling to American policy makers as they prepare for the possibility of war with Iraq. Washington's concern has been that the historic enmity between Israel and its Arab neighbors would resurface and break apart the international coalition if Israeli were involved.

Investcorp, which wants to use the proceeds of any such transaction to reduce the $775 million of debt it assumed when it bought Saks, will focus its efforts on the 13 stores that Saks owns, company officials told Crain's.    Investcorp is a partnership of Arab investors that last spring outbid several of the world's biggest retailers to pay $1.6 billion for the 48-store chain.   Among the options that Investcorp is considering are a mortgage on the properties, floating some form of securitized debt or doing a sale-leaseback transaction.   Saks, which recently reduced its staff by 700 employees, may have a difficult time raising the amount of financing it is seeking because of the weak commercial real estate markets around the country. The retail chain, which reported operating profits of $110.5 million for 1989, said last month that its 1990 profit was expected to be higher.   Investcorp is being advised on a possible transaction by Jones Lang Wootton, an international commercial real estate brokerage and consulting company. Merrill Lynch & Company has been retained to underwrite the sale of securitized mortgages if that method is used."

We also talked at length about the situation in the Soviet Union and the response of the United States to the economic problems there. I asked Minister Shevardnadze to convey to President Gorbachev my desire to respond both to the short-term needs of the Soviet Union and to contribute to fundamental economic reform. I've long supported perestroika and continue to.   We discussed frankly the relationship of economic change in the Soviet Union to the critical task of democratization and I reiterated our strong desire to see both political and economic reform continue because they are inextricably linked. I outlined specific and important steps that we're willing to take in support of reform, and after consulting closely with Secretary Yeutter as well as Secretaries Brady and Baker, I told Minister Shevardnadze that I am prepared to respond to a Soviet request for credit guarantees for purchase of agricultural commodities through a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.    While I've taken this step, I still look forward to a passage of the Soviet immigration law codifying the generally excellent practices of the past year. And this then will permit us to make further progress toward the normalization of the U.S.-Soviet economic relationship. Long-Term I.M.F. Role    In addition, we have proposed to the Soviets a special technical assistance project to help in assessing their food-distribution problem and to support market reforms.   I will also authorize a joint public-private medical-assistance effort to help the Soviet Union cope with immediate shortages of pharmaceuticals and basic medical supplies.   In the longer term, only steps that the Soviet Union itself takes can assure the economic health there. Thus to promote fundamental economic reform, I will propose that the World Bank and the I.M.F. work out with the Soviet Union a special association to give the U.S.S.R. access to the considerable financial and economic expertise of those institutions.   I have asked Secretary of the Treasury Nick Brady, as U.S. governor of both institutions, to pursue this proposal with them and also with our other allies, who I'm sure will be in accord.    As I've said before, I want perestroika to succeed. The Soviet Union is facing tough times, difficult times. But I believe that this is a good reason to act now in order to help the Soviet Union stay the course of democratization and to undertake market reforms. The United States has an interest in a Soviet Union able to play a role as a full and prosperous member of the international community of states. And I'm hopeful that these initiatives will further that goal."

The chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, William Purves, said the decision reflected the bank's global reach and did not signal abandonment of the territory where it has flourished for 125 years.   One broker speaking on condition of anonymity said the action, which transfers the bank's assets to a British holding company, ""leaves the impression that the British are pulling out."" The Chinese authorities had no immediate comment on the move.    Under the plan, the bank will rename its Silom Ltd. subsdiary as HSBC Holdings Ltd. HSBC Holdings will then be transformed into an umbrella company, owning Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and all its holdings."

A GATT spokesman said there would ""certainly be some relief"" that all the major negotiating groups now have an offer on the table. But the spokesman added there would be a need to look at the fine print in some detail. There would also need to be an assurance that there was some room for negotiation, he said.    A large gap remains to be bridged between the American proposal, submitted three weeks ago, for 90 percent cuts in export subsidies and 75 percent in other farm supports, and the community proposal for 30 percent cuts.    The news came from Brussels as five days of crisis meetings at the Geneva headquarters of GATT and among some of the main participants had ended without any clear sign of progress. The four-year-long Uruguay Round is scheduled to end in Brussels Dec. 7.   GATT's Director General, Arthur Dunkel of Switzerland, said with evident disappointment that there were not many signs of movement.    Rubens Ricupero of Brazil, speaking for the developing countries, also said there had been no real negotiating effort in Geneva, and no progress in areas like agriculture and textiles that are of particular importance to developing countries.    He warned that these countries would not accept a package worked out by other nations that is presented on a ""take it or leave it"" basis.

Is this, as some economists are saying, a horrendous blunder, comparable to the decision made by President Herbert Hoover to put through a huge tax rise, nearly doubling rates, as the economy was falling into the depths of the Depression in 1932?      Mr. Hoover's aim was to prevent inflation by closing the budget deficit when businesses were failing, unemployment rising and incomes falling, and the real threat was deflation. Fear of inflation, during a time of falling employment and prices, also greatly restricted the efforts of the Federal Reserve to make more money and credit available and to reduce interest rates. The perverse Hoover fiscal policy and timid Fed monetary policy, which allowed the money supply to shrink by one-third, as banks slashed their lending to business, deepened the Depression.    Are national leaders about to make the same mistakes and thrust the weakened American economy into depression? Should they just forget about reducing the structural budget deficit, regarded as a cause of big trade deficits, savings shortfalls, low capital formation and productivity growth, as well as weakened American competitiveness -- and instead focus on the short-run necessity of fighting recession by increasing the deficit through lower taxes and higher spending? C. Eugene Steuerle, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary for tax analysis at the Treasury Department before joining the Urban Institute in Washington in 1989, contends it would be a serious mistake to forget about reducing the debt burden, which has been growing faster, even in good times, than the national income, for the sake of using short-term fiscal policy to combat the recession.    Indeed, he maintains it is possible to achieve a fiscal policy that will meet both the objectives of short-term economic stabilization and long-term deficit reduction aimed at strengthening national economic growth. To get both, he calls for ""automatic fiscal stabilization through the tax and transfer system"" within the context of long-run fiscal balance.    To get greater fiscal responsiveness to short-run cyclical swings without sacrificing long-term economic stability, he calls for improving public insurance programs. The unemployment compensation system, traditionally the Government's chief weapon for providing anti-recessionary expenditures and insurance, has, he says become a ""timebomb,"" because the system is so inadequately financed that a recession could make many state programs insolvent. Less than one-third of the jobless have received benefits in the last decade.    He would provide financing to unemployment compensation that would make it one of the strongest automatic stabilizers, increasing total demand when the economy slumps and decreasing it when the economy booms.    While improving the automatic stabilizers for short-term fiscal responses, he supports a long-run deficit-reduction target and would stick to it over the course of the business cycle. Negotiators of the recent budget deal, in Mr. Steuerle's view, ""score fairly high marks on their overall deficit-reduction strategy, but score less well on their choice of specific cuts.""      But if one relies only on the automatic stabilizers, rather than on discretionary changes in taxes or spending, to check a recession, will the economy fall into a depression?    Hyman P. Minsky, a visiting professor at Bard College of Columbia University and author of ""Can 'It' Happen Again?"" answers no -- because today's economy is far less vulnerable to deep depression. In 1929 the Federal Government constituted a mere 3 percent of the total United States economy; it now accounts for 25 percent, and its spending will be stable throughout the business cycle.    In addition, the Federal Reserve, in the event of crisis, would move in, as Professor Minsky says, ""to flood the economy with reserves and to prevent a collapse of asset values.""    After the New York stock market crash of October 1987, which swiftly spread to markets around the world, the central banks behaved as a close fraternity, and they are likely to do so in any future crisis. As the former Fed Chairman, Paul A. Volcker, put it in his 1990 Per Jacobson Lecture before the International Monetary Fund: ""In a turbulent world, the importance of restoring a sense of stability is more clearly recognized."""

Nevertheless, there is a major fallacy in the chart intending to compare charges at Stanford and two competing hospitals. Statistics represent variation -- the reported averages are not comparable unless the data distributions of charges are symmetrical.   Quantitative data have three main characteristics -- central tendency (the average), variability (the spread) and shape (the symmetry, or lack thereof). Your chart focused only on central tendency. Stanford's measure was the arithmetic mean -- the average cost of all operations for a given procedure. El Camino's measure was the midrange -- the average of the lowest and the highest cost out of all operations for a given procedure. Sequoia's measure was either the trimmed mean (an average of the midmost 50 percent of all charges for each operation) or the midhinge (the average of the most costly and least costly operations for a given procedure). It is impossible to tell from the chart's key.    As data distributions become more and more asymmetrical, the midrange and the mean become less and less useful because these measures are too highly influenced by extreme values (i.e., unusually high charges will pull the measures up while atypically low charges will pull the measures down). The measure used at Sequoia -- whether trimmed mean or midhinge -- is resistant to extreme values and would clearly be the preferred indicator of average charges if symmetry in the data distributions were lacking. Thus it may well be true that Stanford is the most expensive of the three hospitals with respect to the three procedures selected -- but one simply cannot tell from this chart. Other outcome measures for comparing the three hospitals, such as the proportions of indigent, Medicaid and Medicare patients as well as morbidity indexes to indicate the severity and complexity of illness would be needed to make Stanford's case.

The ad, created by Young & Rubicam, New York, also emphasizes the postal service's technology, and calls on people to help enhance service by using a complete address.    ""The objective is to communicate that the postal service is doing everything it can to improve itself,"" said Rich Kahn, senior vice president and group director at Young & Rubicam."

Many said that the most recent figures pointed to a recession deeper and more prolonged than they had expected. New factory orders for durable goods in November fell 10.5 percent, matching January's record decline. These include the orders for aircraft, automobiles, machinery, metals and computers that nourish the economy for months, or sometimes years. A broader forward-looking index, the leading economic indicators, dropped for the fifth straight month in November, falling 1.2 percent; three straight declines are usually enough to signal a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of business cycles, confirmed that a recession probably began between June and September. Economists are watching the Middle East, the banks and consumers to see how severe the slump will be. High consumer debt and low confidence are likely to aggravate the slowdown, many say. ""If Sam Kahan doesn't know whether he's going to have a job in 1991, he's going to tell the kids 'No more Nintendo games,' "" Mr. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities, said. Middle East peace would give consumers heart, he said, adding that his children remain optimistic that at least one economist will do all right. ""They figure dad is always good for another buck,"" he said.  More Taxes on the Toast  The party's over on Dec. 31 as far as the Government and the liquor stores are concerned. A one-time tax, expected to generate $300 million, is being imposed on wholesale and retail liquor inventories held on that date. Higher excise taxes take effect with the New Year. The excise taxes should add only pennies to the price of a bottle or can of beer, wine or spirits; the tax on a bottle of 80-proof whiskey goes from $1.98 to $2.14. But just as every tremor in the Middle East seems to produce an earthquake at the local filling station, the liquor tax hikes might be amplified and redoubled. Many big American brewers and French and Italian winemakers are seizing the chance to raise prices. Wholesalers and retailers will then add their own markups. Some merchants say a $2 tax increase per case could mean $10 more in the store. Less Action At the Stores  For the nation's retailers, it was almost as if the doldrums and discounts of July had arrived in December. A chronically optimistic bunch, they were nevertheless frankly downcast about this year's Christmas results -- the worst season in years, they said. Some retailers reported last week that sales had dropped from the year before; factoring in inflation, most appeared to have suffered real declines. Shoppers neglected to swarm into the stores at the last minute, as they had done in previous years. The stores usually earn about half their annual profits between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Analysts say that price-cutting, continuing slack sales and weak balance sheets might force more chains into bankruptcy court. A few privileged retailers did report higher sales from customers who were rushing to beat the new 10 percent Federal luxury tax. That levy takes effect on New Year's Day, making very expensive cars, boats, jewelry, furs and private planes that much more difficult to afford. Trouble in the California Freeze  When the parade floats for the Tournament of Roses can't get enough flowers, California must really be in trouble. The state's worst winter freeze in more than half a century has wilted the flower crop and also promised to raise fruit and vegetable prices around the nation. A box of California navel oranges at local produce markets shot up to $22 last week from $12 the week before. Considerably higher prices are likely to spread toward the East over the coming days and weeks. COMPANIES   Drexel Still Pays  The patient might be in a terminal coma, at best a vegetative state, but the continuing treatment remains excruciatingly expensive. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection May 29, but it is still paying two officers $1.45 million a year each, and $21.1 million to the 73 officers still on the payroll. Frederick H. Joseph, the firm's former chief executive and now vice chairman, has to make do with $450,000. Drexel executives speak of the need to pay competitive rates to keep talented people with the firm; creditors say Drexel is depleting its estate with no chance of being revived. Icahn Moves In on Pan Am  The letters and news leaks and telephone calls flew thicker than the Northeast's snow between Carl C. Icahn and Pan Am last week.  Mr. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, added more tangles and twists to his offer to buy Pan American World Airways. First, he sent a tough letter warning Thomas G. Plaskett, the Pan Am chairman, not to sell his Northeast shuttle. Then, through an anonymous but talkative aide, he demanded Mr. Plaskett's ouster. Mr. Icahn, who proposed buying Pan Am for $375 million in mid-December, is expected to make a formal offer in the next several days. Pan Am is desperately searching for help as the slow winter season arrives and its cash supplies dwindle. Japan's Protective Instincts  Maybe, as the United States Treasury Department insists, the Japanese Government really does give unfair breaks to domestic banks and brokerages. Japan's Finance Ministry has quietly begun investigating whether Japanese investment firms pressured two Japanese companies into dropping their deal for Salomon Brothers to issue bonds. A leading executive at Nomura Securities, Japan's largest broker, compared Salomon's entry to ""exporting AIDS from Wall Street."" INTERNATIONAL   Russia's Latest Split  Gorbachev is veering to the right, Yeltsin is staying on the left and a chasm opened last week in the middle. The Russian republic's Parliament, urged on by its President, Boris N. Yeltsin, voted Wednesday night to reduce its contribution to the central Soviet budget by more than 90 percent. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told his own legislature that the confrontation threatens economic collapse. ""This would mean the breakup not only of the economy, but of the Soviet Union,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Gorbachev won the lawmakers' approval of Gennadi I. Yanayev as Vice President only after they initially turned the nomination down. Michael Mandelbaum, director of the Project on East-West relations for the Council on Foreign Relations, called the split inevitable once the republic adopted a free-market plan that Mr. Gorbachev spurned. ""There is no way to have serious economic reform in the Russian republic without a constitutional confrontation,"" Dr. Mandelbaum said. "" What they are saying is, 'We the Russian people are not going to let this corrupt machine take our money anymore.' "" Vineyards Safe and Sound  As 1990 ends, the French village of Chateauneuf-du-Pape can raise a glass of its earthy red wine to one of the most successful examples of government regulation to encourage commerce. In 1954, the village council passed a law forbidding flying saucers -- flying cigars in French parlance -- from landing, fearing they would crush precious grapes. Any that did arrive were to be immediately impounded. Again this year, no saucers or cigars touched down in Chateauneuf-du-Pape, and the vineyards were safe. No word on whether, come 1992, saucers from within the European Community will be allowed in.  "

But there are times when one must choose a path for the future. His indecision and his drift for most of this year into alliance with reactionary forces are very disquieting and may move him on the path toward becoming a Russian Jaruzelski. Jaruzelski thought of himself as a patriot restoring order and avoiding bloodshed. But objectively speaking, what he did was to repress the grass-roots reformist element represented in the Solidarity movement and to set democratization back a decade.   One would have expected that Gorbachev, as a pragmatic politician who unleashed glasnost and the reform impulse, would have found opportunities to work more boldly with reform-minded officials who received popular electoral mandates in the past year -- or at least to adopt the economic measures his own economists have been recommending. The reform movements in the dominant Russian republic have been generally nonviolent and have shown tremendous vitality this year and opened up a real possibility for relegitimizing civil authority from the bottom up."

At that time, the fear of pan-Islamic upheaval gnawed at secular governments and conservative monarchies across the region. It also served to unite much of the Arab world behind secular Iraq as its champion against Iran's avowed desire to export Islamic revolution and topple those regimes that did not subscribe to its absolutism.   ""There was a fear of this Islamic monolith that threatened the entire Arab political order,"" said a senior Western diplomat in Cairo. ""That is no longer the case,"" despite the passions and uncertainties aroused by the vision of foreign, mainly American, soldiers on the conceptual Arab homeland.   The current crisis, by contrast, has laid bare fissures in the one-time perception of Islam's power as a universal rallying point. While virtually all Muslims oppose the deployment of American troops in Saudi Arabia - the land that houses their holiest shrines -many others remain privately wary of association with Saddam Hussein's secular leadership."

We're in the gulf because the world must not and cannot reward aggression. And we're there because our vital interests are at stake. And we're in the gulf because of the brutality of Saddam Hussein.    We're dealing with a dangerous dictator all too willing to use force, who has weapons of mass destruction and is seeking new ones and who desires to control one of the world's key resources -- all at a time in history when the rules of the post-cold-war world are being written.   Objectives of U.S.     Our objectives remain what they were since the outset. We seek Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. We seek the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government. We seek the release of all hostages and the free functioning of all embassies. And we seek the stability and security of this critical region of the world.    We are not alone in these goals and objectives. The United Nations, invigorated with a new sense of purpose, is in full agreement. The United Nations Security Council has endorsed 12 resolutions to condemn Iraq's unprovoked invasion and occupation of Kuwait, implement tough economic sanctions to stop all trade in and out of Iraq and authorize the use of force to compel Saddam to comply.    Saddam Hussein has tried every way he knows how to make this a fight between Iraq and the United States, and clearly he has failed.    Forces of 26 other nations are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops in the gulf. The fact is that it is not the United States against Iraq. It is Iraq against the world. And there's never been a clearer demonstration of a world united against appeasement and aggression.    Yesterday's United Nations Security Council resolution was historic. Once again the Security Council has enhanced the legitimate peacekeeping function of the United Nations. Until yesterday, Saddam may not have understood what he's up against in terms of world opinion. And I'm hopeful that now he will realize that he must leave Kuwait immediately.    I'm continually asked how effective are the U.N. sanctions -- those put into effect on Aug. 6. And I don't know the answer to that question. Clearly the sanctions are having some effect. But I can't tell you that the sanctions alone will get the job done. And thus I welcome yesterday's United Nations action.    The fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe are being severely damaged by the economic effects of Saddam's actions. The developing countries of Africa and in our hemisphere are being victimized by this dictator's rape of his neighbor Kuwait.   Fragile Economies in Trouble     Those who feel that there is no downside to waiting months and months must consider the devastating damage being done every day to the fragile economies of those countries that can afford it the least.    As chairman Alan Greenspan  [ of the Federal Reserve Board ]  testified just the other day, the increase in oil prices resulting directly from Saddam's invasion is hurting our country too. And our economy, as I said the other day, is at best in a serious slowdown, and if uncertainty remains in the energy markets, the slowdown will get worse.    I've spelled out once again our reasons for sending troops to the gulf. Let me tell you the things that concern me most:   First, I put the immorality of the invasion of Kuwait itself. No nation should rape, pillage and brutalize its neighbor. No nation should be able to wipe a member state of the United Nations and the Arab League off the face of the earth.    And I'm deeply concerned about all the hostages, innocent people held against their will in direct contravention of international law. And then there's this cynical and brutal policy of forcing people to beg for their release, parceling out human lives to families and traveling emissaries like so much chattel.    And I'm deeply concerned about our own Embassy in Kuwait. The flag is still flying there. A handful of beleaguered Americans remain inside the Embassy unable to come and go. This treatment of our Embassy violates every civilized principle of diplomacy. And it demeans our people. It demeans our country. And I am determined that this Embassy, as called for under Security Council Resolution 674, be fully replenished and our people free to come home. What kind of precedent will these actions set for the future if Saddam's violation of international law goes unchallenged?    I'm also deeply concerned about the future of Kuwait itself. The tales of rape and assassination, of cold-blooded murder and rampant looting, are almost beyond belief. The whole civilized world must unite and say this kind of treatmet of people must end and those who violated the Kuwaiti people must be brought to justice.  Potential Nuclear Threat     I'm deeply concerned about Saddam's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Imagine his ability to blackmail his neighbors should he possess a nuclear device. We've seen him use chemical weapons on his own people. We've seen him take his own country -- one that should be wealthy and prosperous -- and turn it into a poor country, all because of insatiable appetite for military equipment and conquest.    I've been asked why I ordered more troops to the gulf. I remain hopeful that we can achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis, but if force is required, we and the other 26 countries who have troops in the area will have enough power to get the job done.   In our country, I know that there are fears about another Vietnam. Let me assure you: should military action be required, this will not be another Vietnam; this will not be a protracted, drawn-out war. The forces arrayed are different, the opposition is different, the resupply of Saddam's military would be very different, the countries united against him in the United Nations are different, the topography of Kuwait is different and the motivation of our all-volunteer force is superb.    I want peace. I want peace, not war. But if there must be war, we will not permit our troops to have their hands tied behind their backs, and I pledge to you there will not be any murky ending. If one American soldier has to go into battle, that soldier will have enough force behind him to win, and then get out as soon as possible, as soon as the U.N. objectives have been achieved.   I will never, ever agree to a halfway effort. Let me repeat: we have no argument with the people of Iraq. Indeed, we've only friendship for the people there. And further, I repeat that we have no desire to keep one single American soldier in the gulf a single day longer than is necessary to achieve the objectives set out above.    No one wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis more than I do, and at the same time, no one is more determined than I am to see Saddam's aggression reversed.  'Time Is Running Out'     And lastly, people now caution patience. The United States and the entire world have been patient. I will continue to be patient. But yesterday's U.N. resolution, the 13th by the Security Council, properly says to Saddam Hussein: time is running out. You must leave Kuwait, and we've given you time to do just exactly that.   Many people have talked directly to Saddam Hussein, and to his Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. All have been frustrated by Iraq's ironclad insistence that it will not leave Kuwait. However, to go the extra mile for peace, I will issue an invitation to Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to come to Washington, at a mutually convenient time during the latter part of the week of Dec. 10, to meet with me. And I'll invite ambassadors of several of our coalition partners in the gulf to join me at that meeting.   In addition, I'm asking Secretary Jim Baker to go to Baghdad to see Saddam Hussein, and I will suggest to Iraq's President that he receive the Secretary of State at a mutually convenient time between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15 of next year. Within the mandate -- within the mandate of the United Nations resolutions -- I will be prepared, and so will Secretary Baker, to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis.   However, to be very clear about these efforts to exhaust all means for achieving a political and diplomatic solution, I am not suggesting discussions that will result in anything less than Iraq's complete withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government and freedom for all hostages.    Thank you very much, and I will be glad to respond to a few questions.                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS       A Deadline for War?     Q. Mr. President, now that you have the clear-cut U.N. resolution on use of force, doesn't that force you into a position -- if these talks between the Secretary of State break down, doesn't this force you into the position of having to use force on Jan. 15 if Saddam Hussein hasn't left, and if not, won't we be seen as the one that blinked first?    A. No, the date was not a date at which point force had to be used.    Q. If I could just follow up with another question. Are you going to ask Congress for approval of this resolution? Would you like to see Congress pass the same kind of resolution as the U.N.?   A. I'd love to see Congress pass a resolution enthusiastically endorsing what the United Nations has done, yes. We're in consultation on that and I have no plans to call a special session. I'm not opposed to it, but we're involved in consultations right now. I've talked to several members of Congress, I've talked to leaders in the House, I've talked to several on the Republican side and Democratic side in the Senate. And I want to be sure that these consultations are complete.   Some feel a lame-duck session is not good, that the new members should have a right to have a say. Others feel that we ought to move right now. The Congress, as you know, in their adjournment resolution, had a provision in there that they could come back and take this up. They are a coequal branch of government, they can do that if they want to. But I -- we will continue our consultations. . . .   Price of Victory    Q. Mr. President, you say you're confident that American troops will prevail against Saddam if called upon.    A. Oh, absolutely.   Q. At what price? I mean --   A. Well, I can't give you that. I can't give you that, any figures, of course. But I can say that the movement of this additional force safeguards the lives of every American and every one of our allies in the gulf.    Q. Mr. President, in recent days, senior members of the Administration have emphatically rejected the idea of any special emissaries or diplomatic envoys to or from Iraq to discuss this, on your part. What changed your mind, sir?   A. The United Nations resolution, I think, has a good chance of making Saddam Hussein understand what it is he's up against. I have not felt that he got the message. I hope this will do it. But I am convinced that these two direct meetings that I've discussed here will guarantee to all the people of the world -- certainly to the American people -- that Saddam Hussein not misunderstand, not misinterpret.  .  .  .     Q. You indicate that this date is not actually a deadline for the use of force, merely a date after which force would be permissible. How do you avoid the impression, should that day come and go without military action, that the U.S.-led coalition has in fact blinked?   A. Well, we've got to look at events at the time. But I don't think there will ever be a perception that the United States is going to blink in this situation. That's why I had some of the words in this statement that I had. Yes?  Quest for Mideast Stability    Q. Mr. President, you've just spoken about the weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons, and also that one of your goals is to try to reach stability in the region. Can you reach stability in the region with Saddam Hussein in power?   A. I think most countries, members of the United Nations, feel that there have to be some safeguards put into effect in terms of guaranteeing the security and stability of the gulf. And so I would think that the status quo ante will not be enough, and I think there will be -- there are sanctions in place now, and I think it would be very proper to discuss what those safeguards should be after there has been a total compliance with the United Nations resolutions.  .  .  .     Q. Mr. President, I want to ask if your comments about the Kuwaiti Embassy -- whether it's fair to conclude, based on those, that you will neither close the Embassy nor permit those Americans to be starved out?    A. I will not say exactly what I will do or exactly what I won't do. There is a very interesting report that we got in this morning saying that some Iraqis showed up at the Kuwaiti Embassy -- our Embassy in Kuwait -- and had delivered fruit, vegetables and a case of Iraqi cigarettes to Embassy Kuwait. And apparently there's going to be another delivery tomorrow, including soda pop. And they asked what medical supplies were required. And it doesn't say that. And the Embassy will apparently provide a list tomorrow. And the electricity is still cut off. So this is kind of an interesting little development. But I -- somebody said to me: Well, hy, what about if there's some provocation? They asked me in the leadership meeting. I said consider me provoked when it comes to the United States Embassy. Consider me provoked when I see Americans without proper food and medical equipment.    Q. May I follow up? Do you take it from that communique that you received there that the Iraqis have the message and want to eliminate that as a potential tripwire?    A. I don't know. It's too early -- it's the best question, right on target, one that we were discussing inside. And I -- let's try to be optimistic and say this is -- this could be a positive sign. But it's so far short of compliance with international law that I can't be rejoicing. But it is a very interesting development. . . .   Criticism in Congress    Q. You've been getting some pretty negative comments up on the Hill at these hearings that have been held this week. Now this morning you said this would not be a long, protracted, Vietnam-type war. However, General Odom, the former head of the N.S.A., testified just this morning at the Senate Armed Services that in fact you have to be there for decades. Now presumably he means even after military combat. We'd have to have people in place there as part of a peacekeeping force. Do you see our commitment there extend that far?    A. No I don't.    Q. May I ask something else? Al Gore, yesterday, takes issue with your comments and the comments of some of your aides, such as Brent Scowcroft, about Saddam being able to churn out a nuclear weapon in a matter of months. Gore, who's had some private briefings, apparently, from some of your people, indicates that your Administration statements are misleading.    A. I disagree with the Senator. And if he wants to gamble on the future about the construction of atomic weapons by Saddam Hussein, I don't. And I know what the intelligence says. Every bit of it. And I can't share it, obviously, because we don't comment on intelligence matters. But I am concerned. . . .   Dependability of Allies    Q. Of those 26 nations that you list in the area, how many of those are equally committed to offensive action other than just defensive action?   A. I can't give you the answer to that, because I don't really know. But I'd expect that there is enthusiasm in all quarters of those countries for the U.N. action that was taken yesterday.    Q. With all respect, shouldn't you know how many would follow your troops into battle?    A. I know that what I said is true about the -- if we have to go into battle, and I'm satisfied I know enough about that. I went over in detail -- as you might well imagine a President should, because I have the responsibility as commander in chief -- what might happen if we have to use force. I repeat, I hope we'll never have to have one single shot fired in anger. Yes?   Q. Iraq has been constantly calling for dialogue. Aren't you concerned that those two missions, Tariq Aziz and James Baker, will lead Saddam Hussein to claim that the U.S. is showing signs of weakness?  .  .  .     A. No, I'm not. I'm concerned some might say this is an ultimatum, in which -- all it is is an effort to make sure that he understands the commitment of the United States, that he understands that anything that is done must be done inside the confines of the United Nations resolutions that have been passed, that there will be no contingency, there can be no face-saving. This is not what this is about. This is to be sure that he understands how strongly the President of the United States feels about implementing to a T, without concession, the United Nations position.    And some have told me that he's not getting the message of how determined we are. And I can't think of any better way to do it, at this juncture, in the wake of the U.N. resolution, than this face-to-face meeting. I'm not sure he'll agree to it. . . .    Q. The Soviet Union did indeed vote on our side as far as the resolution, allowing force if it's necessary. Are we going to offer the Soviet Union any compromise on export credits? As you know, there's some concern that they think there's a de facto grain embargo going on because we won't offer export credits in their very needy time.   A. The matters are totally separate and unrelated, but I am concerned about this. And I've talked about, with Mr. Gorbachev, of a willingness to entertain proposals for food -- particularly if the reports prove to be accurate in terms of the severe winter and the hardship that this will inflict on the Soviet people.   Conference on Mideast    Q. Mr. President, you -- Arab experts suggest that Saddam Hussein has hinted in his remarks that he would like to have some sort of deal, but he wouldn't necessarily hold to his demands. Now you're saying you're willing to meet with him. Are you willing to offer him anything in these meetings in return for a pullout, such as a conference on the Middle East?   A. No. Those two items are totally separate. We've made that very very clear. And what I have said is that this will be -- these discussions will be done within the U.N. mandate. . . .    Q. Mr. President, you mentioned the damage that higher oil prices are doing to the world economy. Should Saudi Arabia and other producers share more of their windfall?    A. I think they're doing a pretty good job in underwriting the costs to various countries and helping third-party countries that are -- that have been hurt by all of this. But I think everybody should go the extra mile to help others. . . .   Q. . . . Should Saudi Arabia have a military draft?    A. That's for the Saudi Arabians to decide. I don't think the United States needs one, incidentally. . . .   Risking American Lives    Q. Mr. President, if you ultimately feel that you have to ask Americans to support the use of force, what that, of course, means is that you have to ask some parents to give up the lives of their children.    A. I know it.    Q. And what I was wondering was, we all know how important your children are to you. Do you feel that this issue is important enough to you that you could conceive of giving up one of their lives for it?    A. You know, Maureen, you've put your -- you put your finger on a very difficult question. People say to me: How many lives? How many lives can you expend? Each one's precious. And I don't want to reminisce, but I've been there. I know what it's like to have fallen comrades and see young kids die in battle. And it's only the President that should be asked to make the decision. Is it worth it? How many lives is it worth? Is it worth it to commit one life -- put one life in harm's way -- to achieve these objectives? And that's why I want to get a peaceful resolution to this question. You ought to read my mail. It is so heart-moving. Supportive and yet: ""Please bring my kid home. Please bring my husband home."" And it's a tough question. But a President has to make the right decision. And these are worldwide principles of moral importance. And I will do my level best to bring those kids home without one single shot fired in anger. And if a shot is fired in anger, I want to guarantee each person that their kid, whose life is in harm's way, will have the maximum support, will have the best chance to come home alive and will be backed up to the hilt. And that's why -- it's because of that question that weighs on my mind I added that language this morning about how this will not be a Vietnam. They can criticize me for moving force, and if we got one kid that's apt to be in harm's way, I want him backed up to the hilt by American firepower and others as well. And that's why I'm working as hard as I am, not only to hold this coalition together but to strengthen it. . . . And if force has to be used, the best way to safeguard lives is to see that you got the best and you're willing to use it. . . ."

The company says the coatings provide a moisture barrier that can keep the crunch in rice cereals and saltine crackers, while preserving the moisture in fresh fruits, vegetables, meat and fish.   The coatings consist of sucrose fatty-acid polyesters and are somewhat similar to Olestra, the synthetic, nondigestible fat substitute that the company invented and that is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration. According to the patent, the compounds have long been considered possible fat substitutes, but this is the first time researchers have described their ability to block the transmission of moisture.    According to the patent, the possible uses include keeping cereal from becoming soggy with milk; keeping raisins, prunes and other dried fruit from becoming sticky and clumped together; preventing frozen foods from drying out in frost-free freezers, and keeping bakery products from going stale.    The patent is silent on the key issue of how the coating affects the taste of food, and company officials refused to comment. P.&G. has not announced any plans to commercialize the technology.    Jeffrey J. Kester, Christian A. Bernhardt and three other researchers received patent 4,960,600."

And after a string of mild winters in the Northeast, slack demand is starting to erode gas prices and squeeze drillers and pipeline operators.    It was not supposed to be this way. The invasion of Kuwait made oil, gas's big competitor, double in price, and was a reminder that a growing fraction of the nation's oil is imported, while nearly all gas comes from the United States and Canada. And geologists say that unlike oil, large quantities of natural gas almost certainly await discovery in North America."

The rating change affects about $1.7 billion (United States) in securities issued by the Australian media company controlled by Rupert Murdoch.   Moody's said its action stemmed from a weakening in the media and entertainment businesses in general.   The rating agency said News Corporation's aggressive expansion in the late 1980's, financed by borrowed money, was based on ready access to worldwide financial markets and the ability to quickly sell media assets when their market values were rising. Moody's said that because these conditions had changed, the company's financial flexibility had been hampered and its protections for debt holders had become strained.   Moody's said it expected that declining operating margins in the media and entertainment industries would put pressure on the company's earnings over the intermediate term.   The rating of the company's senior debt was lowered to B-1, from Ba-2, and that of the subordinated debt to B-3, from Ba- 3."

The Government expects to raise $10.2 billion in the stock offering. The 2.16 billion shares will sell for 240 pence, or about $4.73, each, or a total $:5.18 billion, the Government said.   The offering caps Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's privatization program, which has so far raised $65 billion through the sales of Britain's telephone, gas and water utilities, as well as British Airways P.L.C. and other companies.   Some nervousness has arisen about how successful the recent privatizations will be, with an uneasy stock market, the continuing Middle East crisis and the struggle for leadership within Britain's governing Conservative Party.   Investors also remember the sale of the Government's third of the British Petroleum Company, which flopped because it coincided with the October 1987 stock market crash.   But the Energy Secretary, John Wakeham, said 7.3 million people had registered an interest in buying the electric utility shares, second only to the record 7.5 million registrations for British Gas P.L.C.   The Government has also calmed jitters about the offering by saying that it would cancel the sale if war broke out in the Persian Gulf.   ""I think in today's market conditions the offer will be a success,"" said Chris Rowland, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.    The Government signaled its intention to sell 100 percent of each of the 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales. It had been considering whether to scale back the offer to 60 percent if market conditions were poor.   The shares are expected to fetch a 20 percent premium when trading begins on Dec. 11. The application deadline is Dec. 5. Shareholders are to receive an average dividend return of 8.4 percent in the first year, Mr. Wakeham said.   The Government has sought to enhance the complex sale with an installment payment plan of nearly two years, the longest ever, and with bonus shares and discounts on electricity bills, the types of perquisites it has offered in the past.   The Government said at least 34 percent of the shares would be reserved for the general public in Britain, 20 percent would be available to foreign investors and the remaining 46 percent would go to British institutional investors. If heavy British demand for the shares occur, the 20 percent to be offered to foreign investors will be reduced, the Government said."

The official Albania press reported that courts had sentenced 18 people to prison terms of up to 12 years. More than 150 people were on trial for anti-Government acts after the violence last week in four provincial centers, the Albanian state radio reported.   Justice Minister Enver Halili issued a signed and stamped document recognizing the new Democratic Party of Albania exactly one week after its founding, said a party spokesman, Genc Pollo.   The approval came a day after the new party applied for registration and the parliamentary presidium passed a decree formalizing a Communist Party decision of last week to legalize independent political parties.   The decision appeared to reflect growing pressure on the authorities to speed up democratic reforms. After the democratic revolutions that swept the former Soviet bloc last year, Albania is the last country in Europe still under Stalinist rule."

The plan was similar to those in other European member countries of NATO.

They were to be used by specially trained commando forces that would go into action if the country was overrun by the Warsaw Pact."

And figures collected by the archivists at Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in New York, show how such assumptions arose.   Not counting this recent action, the Fed has cut the discount rate by a half-point or more on 25 occasions during the past decade. The Birinyi folks checked to see where the Dow Jones industrial average stood three months after a major discount rate cut. And, in 18 of the 25 cases, the Dow was higher. Pretty reassuring, huh?   But before you uncork the champagne, look carefully at the record during the brief economic downturn in the first half of 1980 and the much deeper recession that began in July 1981 and continued through November 1982.

American advertising is rather naive and might be considered somehow crude. Who really buys a car because pretty girls and boys perform some dances on and around it? It is a car you want to sell, not the dances.   Also, Europeans do not have fewer brands, but rather a selection of brands which promote quality a consumer can depend on.   The open question -- Which type of advertising will be successful? -- will be answered differently every year. As the world shrinks, we all are under various influences and so will advertising be. It is only a question of adjustability and flexibility for all of us. JAN J. MRAZEK  Spring Hill, Fla., Nov. 6"

The investment bank, which is considering moving its offices out of New York City, has an option on a site near the Stamford train station and has begun seeking city and state zoning approvals that would allow it to build a large office tower on the property.   Morgan is also continuing its talks with New York City on keeping its nearly 4,000 employees in New York after its present lease expires in 1997, the spokesman said. It is widely expected that New York will offer Morgan incentives to keep the firm from leaving.   A move to Connecticut by Morgan Stanley would contribute to the erosion of New York's tax base at a time that the city faces severe budget problems.   Wall Street executives have said that other large financial- services companies are watching the Morgan negotiations carefully. If the company leaves New York, they say, it could signal the beginning of an exodus of Wall Street firms."

The action includes the largest antitrust fine ever imposed by the commission -- a fine of $41.4 million against Solvay, Belgium's largest chemical company. Solvay called the fine ""utterly unreasonable"" and said it would appeal.   The commission, the executive board of the 12-nation group, also fined Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries $23.5 million and Chemische Fabrik Kalk G.m.b.H., a unit of BASF A.G. of Germany, $1.38 million.   The commission said the companies had an agreement by which I.C.I. would not sell soda ash on the Continent if Solvay and Chemische Fabrik Kalk stayed out of Britain.   The commission said Solvay and I.C.I. had fixed the market so that companies looking for secondary sources of soda ash ended up buying from the group anyway.   Soda ash is used in the chemical industry as a neutralizing agent. It also accounts for up to 60 percent of the raw material costs of glass making. It is so widely used that the commission said the group's effect ""is ultimately felt by millions of consumers.""   The fine is the second blow to Solvay in three months. In October, the European Community withdrew all anti-dumping duties on soda ash imports from the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation.   Analysts say the end of the duties may hit Solvay's earnings severely. Soda ash and its derivatives represent 10 percent of Solvay's total sales."

In the next two years, the move will add 14,000 domestic sites to the Visa network and 6,000 sites to the Plus network.   Wesley C. Tallman, Visa's executive vice president for debit systems, estimated that financial institutions would see increased teller-machine volume from the 410 million cards from both networks.   Small technical changes will be required in the machines to permit the added access, executives said.   The announcement was made at the Bank Administration Institute's Retail Delivery Systems Conference. Plus is based in Denver, and Visa U.S.A. is based in San Mateo, Calif."

A senior Treasury official, Deputy Secretary John E. Robson, said in an interview today that the department was considering use of an ambiguous provision in last year's bailout legislation that could permit the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the bailout, to borrow an additional $18.8 billion. But he said it would probably be days or longer before a decision would be made as the Administration evaluated the political and practical consequences of borrowing without Congressional approval. He added that even if some funds were borrowed, the pace of the bailout would be forced to slow considerably."

American officials hurriedly contacted the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, after the Minister, Prince Sultan, was quoted by Arab journalists in Riyadh on Sunday as saying Arab countries were ready to grant Iraq ""all its rights."""

Hey, mister, wanna change dollars?   That is the time-honored cry of Egypt's illegal money-dealers, the siren-call of the sharp-eyed men who sidle up to foreigners, offering a deal from a well-thumbed wad. Yet in recent days, the call has been reduced to a sibilant whisper, and it has become as rare as a songbird in a sandstorm -- yet one more victim of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.   With precipitate determination, the authorities here have clamped down on the black market, which offers the Egyptian currency, the pound, at a modest margin above its official rate in the banks, which is now 2.88 Egyptian pounds to the dollar.   At least 13 street dealers in currency have been arrested and ""large amounts"" of contraband dollars have been confiscated from them, Interior Ministry officials said. And the 16 legal dealers in the Port Said duty-free zone on the Suez Canal -- who are officially authorized to deal in free-market dollars -- have been told to close for a month to display their patriotism.   The reason is that, since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the parallel market has been starved of the dollarsthat usually flow from Egyptian expatriate workers returning home from the gulf with dollars to change at the highest available rate.   Responding to the laws of supply and demand, the rare dollars commanded ever higher local prices, and the parallel rate leapt from around 3 pounds to the dollar to 3.25 pounds, while the official rate languished at around 2.85 -- an unusually large gap.   The rate traditionally rises in December as people in business seek dollars to settle year-end accounts.   But the surge to 3.25 also meant that many people risked unlawful transactions to sell dollars for a high price,thereby diverting the American currency from official banking channels.   Dollars, German marks, British pounds, French francs or any other convertible currency are highly valued because Egyptians may not routinely buy them at the banks except for officially authorized transactions.   ""We are Egyptians who love our country and wouldn't do anything to affect its economy,"" said Hassan Abu Reida, president of the Port Said association of legal currency dealers. ""That is why we decided to stop our dealings in dollars for a whole month to prove to everyone that we are not the reason for the rising value of the dollar.""   The authorities, apparently, did not fully share the assessment, charging that the money-changers had far exceeded the small margin above the official rate that they are allowed to offer. Thus, officials said, the dealers had been told to deposit their dollars at the bank and put up signs saying: ""For the sake of Egypt, dealing in dollars has been stopped."" The Port Said market was established three years ago as part of an earlier and much wider crackdown on rampant illegal currency dealing.   Even before the latest ban, the cut-off in remittances had caused problems. Official Egyptian estimates put the likely losses to the economy from lost remittances, fallen tourism and reduced Suez Canal transit fees at $4.5 billion a year.   And even before the gulf crisis, dollars could be a dicey business because Egyptians working in Iraq were supposed to await oft-delayed bank transfers from Baghdad for their earningsand were barred by the Iraqi authorities from carrying dollar bills out of the country.   That, in turn, led to undignified moments at Baghdad's airport as rigorous and unsmiling customs officials uncovered contraband dollars hidden in Egyptian workers' socks, shoes, hems and pockets -- and once even in the backing of a portrait of President Saddam Hussein carried by a homebound Egyptian worker.   Ezzat Sonbati, Assistant Interior Minister, said the newest crackdown had begun to take effect, with the street traders offering to change dollars at three Egyptian pounds while the official rate, set each day by a committee of bankers, had been increased to 2.88.    ""If you find a single black market dollar in Cairo let me know,"" he told a reporter. ""But you'll never find any."""

The court said a group of frequent fliers was entitled to bring a class-action suit on behalf of the nine million members of American's Advantage program under the consumer fraud laws of Illinois.   The group said that American was guilty of breach of contract because of the changes it made in its frequent- flier rules on May 18, 1988, and contended that those who accumulated mileage before that date were subject to capacity controls when they sought to use the program.    Before May 1988, there were no limits on frequent-flier seats. Under the controls a limited number of seats are alloted for a certain types of fares and other restricted travel.   One the lawyers who handled the case, Gilbert Gordon of Marks, Marks & Kaplan of Chicago, said frequent fliers had found it difficult to get seats to highly desirable destinations like Hawaii because of the capacity controls.   He said the court had ruled that his clients could bring suit in a lower court to have American remove the capacity controls for those who want to cash in miles accumulated before May 1988. He said American had said it would appeal the decision to the Illinois Supreme Court."

When other airlines learned of the offer, they matched the promotion, then went one better. Within days, the nation's large airlines were all offering a companion ticket without charge to people who bought a round-trip ticket at the most inexpensive advance-purchase fares."

Sloan Jr.'s credo for turning General Motors into the world's largest company was simple: ""Growth,"" he said, ""is essential to the good health of an enterprise. Deliberately to stop growing is to suffocate."" But size can be stifling as well, and last week G.M. gave up hope of regaining the immense portion of the market it has lost. The auto maker plans to shut nine plants, leaving it with a record quarterly loss of $1.98 billion G.M. executives want a company at least as trim and fit as Ford became after closing plants and cutting costs proved his company's decision to change course. ""Any rigidity by an automobile manufacturer, no matter how large or how well established, is severly penalized by the market,"" he wrote. G.M. said its write-offs cover all foreseeable costs, but many analysts wonder whether G.M. will continue to shrivel. As James P. Womack, who studies the auto industry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, ""The real question is whether four years from now we'll just be repeating the process.""    Ford and Chrysler, despite their efficiency campaigns, had a tough quarter too. The Ford Motor Company's third-quarter earnings fell 78.7 percent to $101.7 million on weak demand for cars and losses at its savings and loan subsidiary. The Chrysler Corporation blamed lower production of minivans and continuing sales incentives for a $214 million loss. Chrysler asked for special concessions from the United Automobile Workers, but the union said that a tentative contract settlement last week followed the pattern at Ford and G.M. Chrysler said on Friday that is has given up on arranging a European joint venture with the Fiat Group of Italy. The End Of the Clamshell Era  It was a landmark in the cluttered landscape of corporate images. The McDonald's plastic foam box completed an identity program that began with the arches and continued with proprietary names for variations on the hamburger. The package served several functions well, said Stewart Mosberg, senior director of the Walter Dorwin Teague Associates industrial design firm. ""It retained heat, it was lightweight, and disposable,"" he said. ""It's ubiquitous. It's everywhere."" But the yellow clamshell boxes with the bold logos also became some of the nation's most visible refuse. Environmentalists faulted the company's plans for recycling packages that otherwise take decades to degrade. Last week, the company abruptly announced it would turn to paper and cellophane packaging instead. The technological challenge: using paper, not foam, to keep the lettuce and tomato cool and the hamburger separate and warm in wrapping a McDLT.   A Slide for Steel  Staying in the steel business has its costs. USX said last week that it plans to make its steel operations a wholly owned subsidiary -- easing the way for a sale of all or part of them, as Carl C. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder, demands. Lower steel earnings left the USX Corporation with a 6.8 percent drop, to $163 million, in third-quarter income, despite higher profits from energy. Bethlehem Steel, still relying almost entirely on its prime business, reported its quarterly profits fell 78 percent to $10.1 million. Even as the weaker dollar has helped American steelmakers fend off imports, overcapacity and a slack economy have tamped down their prices. Said Peter L. Anker, an analyst at First Boston, ""This is the lowest-price market in the world today.""   A Probe at New York Telephone  Prosecutors who have found widespread corruption in the buildings department of New York Telephone may seek criminal indictments, the company's president said on Friday. Frederic V. Salerno said as many as 80 of his employees, and some at other companies, are under investigation. In Brief  R.H. Macy & Co. plans to sell as much as $150 million in equity to help repay its debts. Britain's two satellite television networks, British Satellite Broadcasting and Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television, plan to merge. Harold Evans, the editor in chief of Conde Nast's Traveler magazine, took over as publisher at Random House. Having resigned as editor of The Times of London eight years ago in a dispute with its owner, Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Evans is now responsible for publishing Mr. Murdoch's memoirs. Federal regulators announced plans on Friday to sell 18 large savings and loan associations, including Lincoln Savings, the industry's most costly failure. INTERNATIONAL   A Moscow Currency Sale  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev plies foreign companies with more blandishments, but too few to persuade them that his nation is truly open for business. Mr. Gorbachev has recently announced steps to help Western businesses take home their profits and manage their ventures without Soviet partners. Beginning in January, foreign businesses with ruble earnings will be able to bid at Government auctions of convertible currencies. Western companies doubt they will obtain enough hard currency to avoid the trouble of taking their profits in pickles, pianos and other local products. And these businesses might continue to depend on Soviet partners for office space and plant sites, since foreigners cannot own property and have difficulty renting it. Only a determined program to free prices and make the ruble convertible will allow liberalized business policies to succeed, said Michael Mandelbaum, director of the Project on East-West Relations at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""The history of reform has been too little, too late,"" he said. ""You really need a big bang.""   The Value of a Dinar  It was becoming difficult to squeeze all the zeroes onto the currency. By the time Yugoslavia issued a million-dinar note, now worth less than $10, superscript exponents seemed like the next step. Instead, the Government of Prime Minister Ante Markovic has, in the last year, introduced a new, semi-convertible dinar, worth 10,000 of the old ones, and pegged its value to the German mark. Prices have been freed, import restrictions relaxed. Inflation fell from 2,500 percent last year to less than 1 percent in July and August before higher wages and energy prices caused a 7 percent jump in September. ""It's a shock program,"" said Keith Crane, a senior economist at Planecon, a Washington consulting firm, ""similar to that of Mexico or Poland."" Yugoslavian industrial output fell by about 10 percent this year. But Mr. Markovic's popularity remains one of the few forces holding his fractious country together. THE ECONOMY   The Indicators Drop  A plunge in the leading economic indicators and continuing job losses left many economists debating only about the severity of a recession. The leading index fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in September, the second straight monthly decline. Nonagricultural employment shrank by 70,000 in October, the fourth monthly decline, according to a payroll survey. Although October unemployment remained at 5.7 percent, economists pointed to slow growth in the labor force rather than renewed hiring.  Gloom on Growth  Word that the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the third quarter caused no cheer. Several economists said that higher oil prices began doing damage only recently. Alan C. Lerner, of Bankers Trust, foresees just a short, mild recession. But he added that continued Federal borrowing and burdensome corporate debt will retard growth ""for years to come."" Reading the Fed's Signs  Was the Federal Reserve Board's reduction in interest rates last week just a beginning? Several observers say so. Neal M. Soss, chief economist at First Boston, predicts that, at its Nov. 13 meeting, the Fed will authorize another quarter-percent reduction in the short-term Federal funds rate -- ""with more to come after the New Year."" The cut last Monday, to 7.75 percent, fulfilled the Fed's pledge to ease interest rates after Congress agreed to reduce the budget deficit. Then came a cascade of disappointing reports likely to turn the Fed's attention from fighting inflation to softening a recession. As William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter, said about the Federal Reserve's chairman, ""I don't think Alan Greenspan wants to be the grinch that stole Christmas.""  More Grim News  Much of last week's other economic news was sobering: weekly unemployment claims up 33,000 for the week ending Oct. 20; September new-home sales falling to their lowest level since the 1982 recession; the fourth consecutive monthly drop in the purchasing managers' index of economic activity. Consumer spending did bounce up 1.1 percent in September, and personal income rose as well. But the Federal Reserve said that business and consumer confidence was fading, with slower economic growth in most regions during September."

But already Chancellor Helmut Kohl's main challenger, Oskar Lafontaine of the German Social Democrats, has said that if he wins, he will reduce immigration and asylum rights. Granted, a united Germany can only handle so many new arrivals added to the 16 million poor eastern Germans now folded into the West. But as the rise in racial attacks, Jewish cemetary desecrations and neo-Nazi activity attests, unification has already made some people more aware of themselves as Germans and less tolerant of those who are not. Government policies restricting rights for foreigners will reinforce this view. Chancellor Kohl and his party, the Christian Democratic Union, is in favor of restricting immigration except to foreigners of German ancestry.   Economic pressures may not undermine democracy in Germany. But they could increase German nationalism and xenophobia. With most layoffs in eastern Germany still to come and with unemployed easterners expected to migrate west, economic pressure for all Germans seems near.

Saitama Bank ranked 11th, with 11.2 trillion yen, or $88.18 billion, on deposit.    Both banks have seen their profits decline dramatically in recent months, largely because of lower returns in fund management. The Kyowa Bank has been particularly aggressive in shifting its emphasis away from large companies to small ones. It has also been trying to attract individual accounts, which are usually highly profitable in Japan."

Twenty-eight other workers who accepted small gifts and did not actively collude with vendors will receive various other penalties, said Richard A. Jalkut, the executive vice president and chief operating officer. The measures will range from letters of reprimand to one-time pay reductions of $4,000 or more.    The latest disciplinary actions are in addition to 15 buildings department employees who were previously disclosed as having resigned, retired or been dismissed in the last 16 months.   New York Telephone now plans to investigate about 20 more employees from the department who took early retirement in May under a special program, Mr. Jalkut said. Although their pensions are shielded by law from the company's disciplinary proceedings, their annual bonuses, payable early next year, could be reduced or eliminated if improprieties are found, he said.   Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the office of Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, said that a fraud investigation into the buildings department and its vendors continued and that criminal indictments were possible.   Virtually all of the employees disciplined or being investigated are low-level managers, typically construction foremen and engineers, Mr. Jalkut said. All are in the department's New York City office, he said.    The New York City office of the buildings department has 225 to 250 managers. ""Up to half of them let us down in a big way,"" Mr. Jalkut said.   New York Telephone said the 28 employees who left the company this week had accepted cash and gifts totaling $48,000, while the others ""accepted gifts such as liquor or gift certificates during the holiday season.""   John Nobile, a buildings department engineer, was indicted on June 12 on 22 counts of bid rigging, accepting bribes, theft and tax evasion. He was accused of accepting nearly $600,000 from five companies in exchange for awarding them overpriced contracts. Mr. Nobile and a contractor indicted with him have pleaded not guilty. No trial date has been set.   Mr. Jalkut said the 28 employees leaving the company had colluded with vendors and accepted substantial gifts of cash, liquor or gift certificates, activities violating the company's business code. In exchange, he said, the employees stored vendors' tools, allowed vendors to park vehicles on company property and in some cases steered contracts that did not require bidding to such vendors.    The other 28 employees accepted holiday gifts but do not appear to have done favors, Mr. Jalkut said."

In October, Chartwell resigned from a special Avon committee that is examining ways to increase the company's stock price. Chartwell said the New York-based beauty products company was not seriously interested in enhancing shareholder value. It then hired Lehman Brothers to come up with proposals for Avon.   Chartwell, which controls 26.2 percent of Avon's common shares outstanding and 19.8 percent of the voting shares, also recommended in its letter that Avon explore raising its dividend, consider selling subsidiaries and rethink its plan to sell a portion of its Avon Japan business.

The rosier sentiment here in reaction to the resurgent yen indicates how much the Japanese have altered their economy since 1985, when the leading industrial nations began a conscious effort to push the dollar lower to ease America's yawning trade deficit. At that time, Japanese companies complained loudly as the yen soared and their products became more expensive overseas, reducing the exports on which the economy thrived.   But today, the markets have focused not on the negative impact a rising yen might have on exports, but on two big benefits: It has reduced Japan's bill for imported oil, which must be paid in dollars, providing considerable relief from soaring world energy prices in the wake of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, and it has permitted interest rates here to fall after a damaging yearlong surge.  Bond Yield Drops    The dollar has declined from 150 yen in mid-July to as low as 124.40 last Thursday in New York, a 17 percent tumble. Buffeted by fears of a recession and the budget crisis in Washington, the dollar, although up slightly the last two days to close at 126.02 today in New York, is edging toward its record low of 120.45, reached in January 1988.   The yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year Government bond, meanwhile, has plummeted from 8.7 percent a month ago to 7.75 percent today, as the stronger yen has slightly reduced concerns about inflation. There is talk now that commercial banks may reduce their key long-term prime lending rate after steep increases in recent months.   That has revived the deeply troubled stock market, which has been through a severe slide, largely because of the higher cost of borrowing. The Nikkei stock average closed today at 25,070.86, up 2.4 percent, or 589.37 points. That still represents a 36 percent tumble from the beginning of the year, but it is also a steep increase from its low last month of nearly 20,000.   ""You don't hear Japanese companies crying out the way they did when the dollar fell before,"" added Yoshihisa Kitai, aneconomist at the Long Term Credit Bank. ""Japanese companies have already restructured their businesses to deal with this, and now you are seeing the result.""   Until a few years ago, the weak yen had been a big source of economic strength for Japan, encouraging foreign buyers to purchase Japanese goods.   Concern About the Dollar    For the last few years, though, the Government has encouraged industries to cultivate the domestic market and invest heavily to increase productivity and to move more plants overseas.   Japanese Government officials are thus sanguine about the yen's strength, worrying only that it might rise too fast and disrupt the markets. ""It is very interesting and telling that we hear very few complaints about the exchange rate,"" said a senior Government economic official. ""It reflects the fact that companies have adapted.""   Government and industry officials in Japan are more worried by the what the falling dollar signals about the United States. Many people blame the battle in Washington over the Federal budget and fears of a looming recession for an erosion of confidence in the American economy and American policy makers.   The message is that these officials have fewer concerns about their home market. Manufacturers have moved a significant portion of their factories overseas to avoid the impact of currency swings. Toyota, for instance, announced it was building a second auto plant in the United States, just one in a wave of such moves.   The Government has also shown some success in waking up the Japanese consumer and creating a boom at home that has eased further the reliance on exports. Retail sales have been expanding at a nearly double-digit rate this year, for instance. And a record level of capital investment by Japanese companies is providing a big impetus for economic growth.   On top of that, the dollar's tumble has offset part of the huge increase in crude oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.   ""If the dollar falls to 110 yen, then you could begin to see some problems, but most companies have already achieved the ability to deal well with the dollar at 120 yen,"" said Susumu Kato, the chief economist for Goldman Sachs (Japan)."

Gorbachev is named to succeed Konstantin U. Chernenko as Soviet leader and outlines an urgent agenda to improve the economy. At 54, he is the youngest man to take charge of the Soviet Union since Stalin, who was 45.    April 1985: Mr. Gorbachev emphasizes the need to reshape the economy and reduce rigidity in the Soviet system, in a process known as perestroika.    July 1985: The Gorbachev Politburo removes the veteran Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, and names him to the largely ceremonial Soviet presidency. Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who had been the Communist Party leader of the Georgian republic, replaces him.    March 1986: A Communist Party congress approves a resolution calling for ""truly revolutionary changes"" in the economy.   January 1987: The Communist Party Central Committee approves Mr. Gorbachev's plan to give voters a choice of candidates in local elections.   October 1987: Boris N. Yeltsin, the Moscow party leader and a favorite of those advocating swifter change, attacks Yegor K. Ligachev, a conservative who is the No. 2 party leader. Mr. Yeltsin is forced out of his party posts.   November 1987: On the 70th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Mr. Gorbachev sharply criticizes Stalin, helping to legitimize criticism of other organs of repression and loosening censorship.    March 1989: In the first free elections since 1917, scores of party officials suffer humiliating defeats in races for the new national legislature, the Congress of People's Deputies.    July 1989: With Kremlin leaders openly alarmed that the Communist Party is losing control, Mr. Gorbachev calls for a sweeping purge of party ranks to replace conservatives at all levels.   November 1989: In an apparent effort to mollify conservatives, Mr. Gorbachev publishes a manifesto insisting that Marxism will be revived in the Soviet Union, and under the leadership of the party. He describes his goal as ""humane socialism.""   December 1989: The Communist Party in Lithuania, the most independence-minded of the Soviet Union's 15 republics, breaks with Moscow. Mr. Gorbachev denounces the move.   January 1990: Mr. Gorbachev meets Lithuanian Communist Party leaders and says he understands motivation behind their vote to break away from Moscow and will not attempt to undo it. But later, he demands that Lithuania pay $33 billion in compensation if the republic breaks away. Political dissidents from across country meet in Moscow to openly challenge party dominance, and ethnic violence in Azerbaijan adds to the impression of events spinning out of control.   February 1990: Over the fierce objections of hard-liners, the Communist Party Central Committee adopts Mr. Gorbachev's plan to end the constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power held by the Communist Party and recommends creation of a powerful Western-style presidency and a Cabinet form of government.   March 1990: In elections in the Soviet republics, independent pro-democracy groups achieve major gains in the Russian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics and outright control of local governments in Moscow, Leningrad and other cities. The Lithuanian parliament declares that the annexation of the republic by the Soviet Union in 1940 is null and void. Mr. Gorbachev is elected by the Soviet Parliament to the new executive presidency with powers he says he needs to prevent nation from economic collapse and ethnic crisis.    July 1990: At a Communist Party congress the conservative Mr. Ligachev denounces five years of ""blind radicalism"" by Mr. Gorbachev. He is greeted by thunderous applause, but later loses an election for the No. 2 post in the reorganized Politburo. On Mr. Gorbachev's other flank, Mr. Yeltsin, who has rebounded from his 1987 disgrace to become leader of the Russian republic and Mr. Gorbachev's chief rival, walks out of the congress and quits the Communist Party to express dismay with the pace of change.   September 1990: Soviet farmers produce the most bountiful crop in the nation's history, but a decaying transportation network and regional hoarding translate into worsening shortages on grocery shelves.    December 1990: Western governments, though conceding there is no imminent danger of famine, rush to provide food aid to the Soviet Union as a sign of political support for Mr. Gorbachev. The Congress of People's Deputies convenes to approve Mr. Gorbachev's plan for revamping the Government to give him greater powers and to debate the concept of a new union treaty that would adjust the balance of powers between Moscow and the republics. Mr. Shevardnadze resigns, asserting that reactionaries are pushing the country toward dictatorship."

VETO ON ISRAEL,"  For the third time since the Persian Gulf crisis began four months ago, the Bush Administration is trying to avoid using its veto in Israel's defense Thursday when the United Nations Security Council is expected to vote on a new resolution criticizing Israel's treatment of Palestinians in territories it has occupied.    All last month, when the United States held the rotating presidency of the Security Council, American diplomats worked to prevent a vote on the resolution because it did not want to embarrass its Arab allies in the gulf by vetoing the measure before the Council had agreed to authorize the use of force to expel Iraq from Kuwait if necessary after Jan. 15."

The visits are only one way that the barriers between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are breaking down -- not so dramatically as the destruction of the Berlin wall, but with scarcely less significance for this region.The four-decade ban by Taiwan on official contacts with mainland Chinese authorities is eroding, under the pressure of the legislators' visits and as well as joint meetings on repatriation of illegal immigrants from the mainland. Last month, Red Cross officials from Taiwan and China met secretly on Quemoy, an island administered by Taiwan off the coast of southern China, to negotiate repatriation of Chinese refugees who had fled to Taiwan. The news came out after the talks ended."

We Americans are finally facing up, if only partially, to correcting a decade of public and private profligacy, during which the country borrowed massively at home and abroad to finance a consumption boom.

The budget agreement is a major step in that direction."

I. du Pont de Nemours & Company today reported a 2.6 percent drop in its third-quarter earnings, with increases in its petroleum operations offset by slower growth in the company's chemicals businesses.   The company reported net income of $533 million in the quarter, down from $547 million a year earlier. Earnings per share were flat at 79 cents and reflected the lower number of shares this year because of a stock-buyback program.   Revenues for the quarter were up 15.6 percent, at $9.93 billion, compared with $8.59 billion in 1989.   ""Third-quarter results reflect strong performance from our petroleum operations,"" Du Pont's chairman, Edgar S. Woolard Jr., said. ""At the same time, earnings in several of our chemical businesses continued to be adversely affected by the slowdown in the U.S. economy.""   Du Pont said the improvement in petroleum earnings was partly a result of higher oil prices, which soared after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The company said 70 percent of the overall improvement was a result of operations overseas, where there was a strong demand for petroleum products and greater efficiency at the company's refineries.   Du Pont also said its quarterly results included gains of 8 cents a share from the sale of an interest in a North Sea oil property and an instrument systems business.   The company's shares were unchanged today at $34.75 on the New York Stock Exchange."

The card fraud was discovered by A.T.&T. when use of the number exceeded typical patterns. The number has been deactivated, Mr. Nesbitt said.

Robert, at 36, is three years' Gene's junior; he is close cropped and buttoned down, has an M.B.A. and runs the financial side of the company. In an era of retail retrenchment, it may be just this mix -- innovative fashion merchandiser and sober financier -- coupled with rich Japanese backers that will make Barneys fly as other retailers flounder. While in malls and on Main Street fashion industry executives are struggling just to survive, the Pressmans have been thinking: the world."

Please,"" Nov. 4) describing a husband-disposing, man-procuring chain letter scheme. And I appreciate the wry, witty spirit of her plan to ""bring relief to tired, discontented women"" encouraging them to trade their own ""s.o.b."" and a postage stamp for 16,748 men, some of whom ""are dandies."" Yet I can't help but wonder what might have happened if her letter had been written by a man describing a chain letter to ""bored, disgruntled men."" Imagine it urged them to ""ship off the old bag"" to the name at the top of the list in anticipation of receiving thousands of women, some of whom ""are real honeys!"" If such a letter ever saw print, picture the torrents of reader protests, peer criticism and media pontification.   The humor displayed in Ms. Shectman's chain letter is a healthy and honest expression of the unfulfillment and frustration with personal relationships that many women experience. But such emotions are not limited to women. How refreshing it would be if men were freer to humorously (and publicly) express their disaffections with women without fear of being labeled Neanderthals. KENNETH DIAMOND  New York, Nov. 6"

Gossage, a chemical engineer who joined Hercules Inc. two years ago to run the company's core specialty chemicals business, will become its chairman and chief executive on Jan. 1, the company said. He replaces David S. Hollingsworth, 62 years old, who announced in July that he would retire at the end of the year.   Mr. Gossage, 56, will oversee the eclectic mix of businesses at Hercules, which range from resins, fragrances and food additives to electronic products and aerospace technology. The company, based in Wilmington, Del, had total sales of $3.09 billion in 1989.   The biggest challenge facing Mr. Gossage ""is taking leadership of a company as diverse as Hercules is,"" said Ted Semegran, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York.   Mr. Gossage, a senior vice president and president of the Hercules Aqualon subsidiary, said he did not plan any shifts in strategy. But he added, ""We've had some difficulty delivering our financial results, and we need to move the crediblity of the company back up to an acceptable level.""   Hercules took a pretax charge against earnings of $323 million last year to cover cost overruns on its Titan 4 solid-fuel booster rocket.  Analysts say that the future of Hercules depends heavily on the success of the Titan 4 program, which has absorbed most of the company's $1 billion investment in aerospace technology.   The chairman-elect acknowledged that he had limited experience managing the crucial aerospace business at Hercules, but said that he planned to get more involved. Mr. Gossage said a new management team has ""their arms wrapped around that business, and they know what needs to be done.""   Before joining Hercules in 1988, Mr. Gossage worked for 26 years at the Monsanto Company. A native of Nashville, Mr. Gossage recieved B.S. and M.S. degrees in chemical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology.   He and his wife live in Wilmington."

The battle is being played out in state legislatures and in Congress, where a bill has been introduced to halt these ""charter flips.""

Baker 3d's appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, as recorded by The New York Times:  WEBSTER STATEMENT     Despite mounting disruptions and hardships resulting from sanctions, Saddam apparently believes that he can outlast international resolve to maintain sanctions. We see no indication that Saddam is concerned at this point that domestic discontent is growing to levels that may threaten his regime or that problems resulting from the sanctions are causing him to rethink his policy on Kuwait. The Iraqi people have experienced considerable deprivation in the past. Given the brutal nature of the Iraqi security services, the population is not likely to oppose Saddam openly. Our judgment has been, and continues to be, that there is no assurance or guarantee that economic hardships will compel Saddam to change his policies or lead to internal unrest that would threaten his regime. . . ."

Past recessions proved that parents will give up a lot of things before they will disappoint their children on Christmas.    Nonetheless, the stock market seems largely to be ignoring past trends and focusing more on bleak expectations for the economy and the evaporation of consumer confidence. A number of toy industry stocks are trading close to their 52-week lows.    And there are indeed some indications that this Christmas season may run counter to past trends. Cautious retailers, wary of being left with shelves of unbought goods, are keeping inventories low on all items, including toys. And fewer people are visiting shopping malls. ""What the stocks are saying is, 'There might be somewhat more cyclicality here than meets the eye,' "" said Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company.     Analysts and toy company executives say that specific products, along with overall economic conditions, help to determine the health of the $13-billion-a-year industry. ""A strong product trend can buck an economic trend,"" Ms. French said.    Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said the recession year of 1982 ""was a great year for the toy industry."" He added, ""Parents know what a slowdown is, but kids don't.""    B. J. French, a spokeswoman for the Tonka Corporation, agrees. ""Even in the recession of the early 1980's,"" she said, ""toy sales seemed to go up.""    Nintendo continues to captivate toy buyers, andthe Japanese machines and their accompanying games, made under license by a number of companies, are again expected to be best sellers. Sales of electronic games are projected at $4 billion this year, more than 20 percent of all toy sales. Still, analysts say the video craze may finally be peaking, a result of boredom and saturation.   In any case, American toy makers largely missed the video boom. Mattel Inc., for instance, was preoccupied with financial problems several years ago and was unable to develop competitive video products. It has since found a way to take advantage of the craze with its Power Glove, which slips over a player's hand, replacing the stick control.    Hasbro Inc. spent millions of dollars developing Nemo, its own electronic video game, but never brought it out.    Going forward, any decline in video games' popularity should free a lot of dollars for other items, to the benefit of traditional toy makers like Hasbro and Mattel.   The Barbie doll by Mattel is experiencing strong sales, and large dolls are also selling well. ""You are seeing emotional items doing better,"" said Mr. Jacobson of Kidder, Peabody. Sales are strong again for Cabbage Patch dolls, which have belonged to Hasbro since it acquired Coleco Industries in 1989.    When it comes to individual toy stocks, a mixed picture exists. ""I like the two big guys, and I'd avoid everything else,"" Mr. Jacobson said, referring to Mattel and Hasbro.    Mattel, which has undergone a significant revamping in the last few years, is a favorite of analysts. Its stock price has nearly tripled in two years. Barbie accounted for about half of the company's 1989 sales of $1.23 billion, analysts say. Mattel's stock closed at $19.125 yesterday, down 12.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.    Analysts cite Hasbro as a model of diversification, which makes it less dependent on the hit products that typically drive the industry. Nonetheless, investors want the company to develop a substitute for its flagging G.I. Joe and Transformer lines. A share of Hasbro closed at $15 yesterday, up 75 cents on the American Stock Exchange.    Heavy debts or concerns about management have caused analysts to steer away from other companies. ""Tonka is at a critical state,"" Mr. Jacobson said, citing the company's indebtedness, a result of its 1987 acquisition of Kenner Parker.     Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., which makes miniature vehicles known as Micro Machines, is out of favor for its inability to develop a core line of products to sustain the company between hits.    In the short term, toy sales should benefit from changing demographics, Mr. Jacobson said, noting that last year there were nearly four million births in the United States, the most in 30 years. Plenty of money will be spent on these children of the baby-boom generation, he said, because there are more two-income households, more affluent grandparents, and more divorces, which often lead to each parent's spending heavily on toys.    But Mr. Jacobson also says that children are growing up faster and tend to quit playing with toys at a younger age. ""Twenty years ago, 12-year-old kids played with dolls and cars,"" he wrote in a recent report. ""Today they are most likely interested in CD's, movies and the opposite sex."""

The prediction, by L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, appeared to be another sign of the deterioration of the bank insurance system. It came less than three months after he had said that the fund would probably lose about $3 billion, a revision that itself was only a few months old. A loss of $4 billion for the year would put the fund at about $9 billion, only about $7 billion of which is readily available in cash."

Renato Ruggiero, Italy's trade minister, who presided at today's meeting, said, ""Success is possible in all 15 subjects of the Uruguay Round,"" including farm subsidies.    After months of deadlock, the European Community last week approved a negotiating position on farm subsidies that fell far short of the sharp cuts sought by the United States, Canada and other food-exporting nations, including Australia, Argentina and Brazil. The Europeans, who have long had a policy of subsidizing small farmers because of their political strength, finally agreed to consider a 30 percent cut in subsidies covering a 10-year period retroactive to 1986.    The big producers, including the United States, want reductions of 75 percent in price supports and 90 percent in export subsidies over 10 years beginning in 1991. Japan, where small farmers are also a potent political force, is the only major country taking the European side.    Mr. Ruggiero reiterated the community's position that its negotiating position had room for change. ""We have never said it is a take-it-or-leave-it offer,"" he said.

Sues Executives Of Drexel,"  The Columbia Savings and Loan Association yesterday filed a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit against a number of the current and former senior executives with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., contending that they were responsible for the huge losses in Columbia's portfolio of high-yield ""junk bonds.""   The suit, which names Michael R. Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond division, other executives and hundreds of investment partnerships that included Drexel employees, portrays the junk bond market as driven by fraud and Columbia as one of a number of victims.   In the allegations included in the suit filed in Los Angeles, Columbia contends that Mr. Milken and other Drexel executives used a series of more than 500 investment partnerships, as well as other means, to create the fictitious appearance of a true market in junk bonds.  Billions of Dollars Invested    As a result, they contend that Columbia invested in billions of dollars of debt securities it otherwise would not have purchased.    A spokesman for Drexel said that the firm had not seen the new suit, and could not yet comment for the executives.    A spokesman for Mr. Milken denied the allegations in a statement. ""Columbia and its attorneys have invented a revolutionary new legal strategy -- having a plaintiff plead insanity"" the statement said. ""Columbia's 'let's blame Milken' approach is a transparent attempt to ignore facts and rewrite history."" The statement concludes by saying that the suit is without merit.    Columbia had been one of the biggest purchasers of junk bonds from Drexel, and its former chairman, Thomas Spiegel, who resigned last year, was a close associate of Mr. Milken.  Protection From Creditors    The suit comes one month after Columbia filed a similar $4.5 billion claim against Drexel with the Federal Bankruptcy Court in New York. Drexel filed for protection from its creditors earlier this year.    Primarily as a result of its junk bond losses, Columbia is insolvent and appears on the brink of being seized by Federal regulators.    If Columbia is successful in its suit, it would bode poorly for much of Wall Street. Numerous investment banks underwrote junk bonds in the 1980's and some continue to try to do so today, and if a plaintiff successfully argues that the market in the 1980's was fraudulent, these firms would be potentially exposed to liability.   In its claim, Columbia says that in 1982 it was ""ill equipped"" to handle the new authority that was granted to the savings and loan industry by Congress to invest in corporate securities, including junk bonds. ""Consequently, Columbia was susceptible to unscrupulous salesmen,"" the complaint says."

The State Department said the decision to remove all personnel from the embassy, which had been maintained as a symbol of defiance against the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait, was prompted by purely technical considerations.   On the day that Iraq's National Assembly gave pro forma approval to a decision by President Saddam Hussein to permit all foreigners to leave Iraq and Kuwait, it seemed that all American hostages would choose to leave Kuwait. And with the legitimate Kuwaiti Government having set up temporary home in Taif, Saudi Arabia, the embassy no longer served any purpose, the department said.     In Baghdad today, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said he thought all the foreign hostages prevented from leaving Iraq and Kuwait could receive exit visas and leave the country in a ""few days.""

Gorbachev is named to succeed the late Konstantin U. Chernenko as Soviet leader and outlines an urgent agenda to improve the economy.   April 1985: Mr. Gorbachev elevates three new members to the Politburo: Viktor M. Chebrikov, head of the K.G.B.; Yegor K. Ligachev, chief of party appointments, and Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, manager of the Soviet economy. Mr. Gorbachev emphasizes the need to reshape the economy and reduce rigidity in the Soviet system, in a process known as perestroika.    July 1985: The Gorbachev Politburo removes the veteran Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, and names him to the prestigious but largely ceremonial Soviet presidency. Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Communist Party leader in the Georgian Republic, replaces him.    March 1986: At the behest of Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Ryzhkov, the 27th Communist Party Congress approves a resolution calling for ""truly revolutionary changes"" in the economy.    January 1987: The Central Committee approves Mr. Gorbachev's plan to give voters a choice of candidates in local elections. It also approves Mr. Gorbachev's proposals for greater flexibility in elections within the ruling party, where the real authority lies.    October 1987: The Moscow party leader, Boris N. Yeltsin, attacks Mr. Ligachev, the No. 2 party leader. Mr. Yeltsin announces his resignation as Moscow party leader and is later dropped from the Politburo. Mr. Yeltsin later regains status as a legislator in the new Parliament, and then leader of the Russian Republic.    June 1988: In a speech to the first special Communist Party conference since 1941, Mr. Gorbachev declares that an overhaul of the system is imperative.    March 1989: In the first free elections since 1917, scores of party officials suffer humiliating defeats in races for the new national legislature, the Congress of People's Deputies.    July 1989: With Kremlin leaders openly alarmed that the Communist Party is losing control, Mr. Gorbachev calls for a sweeping purge to replace conservatives at all levels.   November 1989: In a manifesto insisting that Marxism will be retained in the Soviet Union, Mr. Gorbachev describes his goal as ""humane socialism.""   December 1989: The Communist Party in Lithuania breaks with Moscow. Mr. Gorbachev denounces the move.    January 1990: Mr. Gorbachev demands that Lithuania pay $33 billion in compensation if the republic breaks away. Political dissidents from across country meet in Moscow to openly challenge party dominance, and ethnic violence in Azerbaijan adds to impression of events spinning out of control.   February 1990: As the Communist Party Central Committee meets, 100,000 people rally in Moscow to demand democratic change. Mr. Gorbachev calls on the party to accept rival political organizations and urges the most sweeping internal reorganization since Lenin, including more power for himself. Parliament votes to end the monopoly on power held by the party for over 70 years and recommend creation of a powerful Western-style presidency and a Cabinet form of government.    March 1990: In elections in the Soviet republics, independent pro-democracy groups achieve major gains in the Russian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics and outright control of local governments in Moscow, Leningrad and other cities. The Lithuanian Parliament elects the first non-Communist premier of a Soviet republic, then votes to have Lithuania secede from the Soviet Union and recover the independence lost in 1940. Mr. Gorbachev is elected by the Soviet Parliament to a new executive presidency with powers he says he needs to prevent economic collapse and ethnic crisis from overwhelming the nation.    July 1990: Mr. Yeltsin, leader of the Russian republic and Mr. Gorbachev's chief rival, walks out of the Congress and quits the Communist Party.   November 1990: Mr. Gorbachev dismisses Mr. Ryzhkov and announces that executive power will be wielded by himself and the presidents of the 15 republics."

Postpones Vote On Resolution on Israel,"  The United Nations Security Council postponed a vote on a Middle East resolution again today, at the request of the Soviet Union.   The Soviets asked for the postponement to give Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze time to discuss the problem with the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, at a meeting planned for Friday in Turkey.   Exactly what Mr. Shevardnadze will propose to Mr. Arafat remains unclear. But most Security Council members want to change the draft resolution to avoid an American veto, which would embarrass Washington's Arab allies in the gulf crisis by giving President Saddam Hussein of Iraq more ammunition in his campaign to portray them as the friends of Israel's protector.    The postponement until Monday is the third the Council has agreed to in the last week, as the United States struggles to modify the draft resolution to avoid vetoing it.   A majority of Council members appear ready to vote for the draft, which extends more United Nations protection to Palestinians in the occupied territories, defined as including Jerusalem, as well as endorsing the idea of an international peace conference to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute.   Supporters of the resolution argue that the Security Council cannot credibly punish Iraq for annexing Kuwait while ignoring Israel's continued occupation of Arab lands."

The NCR Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest computer maker, rejected the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's takeover offer of $6 billion, or $90 a share. A.T.& T., whose own efforts to market computers have been costly disgraces, desires NCR so ardently that it offered a 60 percent premium over the stock's previous price. NCR initially resorted to the ""Garbo defense."" Said NCR's chairman and chief executive, Charles E. Exley Jr., ""We want to be left alone."" Then his board members decided they would rather be left wealthy, and offered to negotiate at $125 a share. Whereupon A.T.& T. turned its $90 bid into a hostile offer. Analysts treated all the hubub as tactical -- a prelude, said Jack Grubman of PaineWebber, to a friendly deal for at least $100 a share. ""A.T.& T. wants to get this done in the nicest, most friendly way possible,"" he said. ""It's just a matter of price."" Bankrupt, Again  For Continental Airlines, bankruptcy is becoming the continuation of business by other means. The nation's fifth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday while assuring passengers and travel agents that it would continue to do business as usual. The last time the airline filed for bankruptcy was in 1983, in the grip of a strike, and it resumed operating at a fraction of its former size. Continental's current problems are the huge debts created by Frank Lorenzo, the former chairman, and the high oil prices that have accompanied the Mideast crisis. ""I think the creditors understand that this bankruptcy is substantially different,"" said Thomas Longman, an analyst at Bear Stearns. ""I don't see any reason to think they will be out of business."" It helps that under Hollis L. Harris, the current chairman, Continental has taught cabin attendants to treat passengers better than the baggage. Talley's Tally  From corporate headquarters in Phoenix came word that Talley Industries Inc. would eliminate its quarterly 12 1/2-cent dividend. From the board meeting in Miami came word that the dividend would be paid. Turns out that the company's clever administrators had written press releases to suit every possible board decision. Fortunately for stockholders, the Miami announcement was right. Yes, There Will Be a Macy's  R.H. Macy & Company took out a full-page advertisement last week to say it can survive the Christmas season without ""miracles on 34th Street."" ""We expect it to be slow and we are prepared for it,"" wrote Edward S. Finkelstein, chairman and chief executive. Macy's is bowed under $5 billion in debt and mounting losses. The ad, in Women's Wear Daily, might have worried the very suppliers and creditors it was supposed to reassure. In the movie, ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" after all, a headline-conscious Macy's executive says he believes in Santa Claus. Fed Helps Banks to a Hold  You can't just tell bankers to make more loans. You have to offer them money. After months of urging the banks to stoke the economy by loosening credit, the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday came up with an incentive. The Fed eliminated a requirement that banks hold in reserves 3 percent of their corporate certificates of deposit. The action frees about $13 billion for new lending, and is expected to increase bank profits by about $1 billion a year, mostly at the largest institutions. Bank stocks jumped from dismal levels to merely low, as some industry analysts upgraded their recommendations from sell to hold. Sandoz Cuts a Price, a Bit  No blood, no drug. That had been the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation's profitable slogan. The company forced schizophrenia victims to buy a blood-monitoring rig that pushed the cost of treatment with the drug clozapine to $8,944 a year. Many Federal and state hospitals ruled the drug out instead of paying such a price. Under pressure from Congress and advocates for the mentally ill, the Swiss-owned company has agreed to sell the drug alone, cutting the price to about $5,000 in the United States. That's still much higher than the government-controlled prices of $2,500 in Germany and $1,000 in Britain.    INTERNATIONAL   Japan's Mideast Role  One Japanese export unlikely to grow is aid to the American-led military effort in the Middle East. Although Japan buys a higher portion of its oil from the Middle East than the United States does, Japanese leaders only reluctantly raised their contribution, from $1 billion to $4 billion -- ""microscopic,"" considering the size of the Japanese economy, former Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group investment bank, recently told the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in New York. Shuzo Muramoto, former president of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said in New York last week that Japan already gives more foreign aid than the United States, and added, ""Japanese resources are not as abundant as you may think."" But Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, told the Japan Society of one other reason the Japanese were unlikely to raise their support for American forces in the Middle East: the troops are already there. ""Make sure the next time military peace keeping is undertaken by the United States, we get our commitments before we go in,"" he advised. Vietnam's Sorry Economic State  As Vietnam begs for foreign aid, United States officials ponder whether to end their economic blockade. C. Peter Timmer, a Harvard economist, said that the Vietnamese dong is worth so little that dollars are the accepted medium of exchange. The 5,000 dong note, the nation's largest, is worth less than a dollar. Vietnam's leaders published a plan last week to save the economy from socialist strangulation by turning to free markets. They aim to cut the annual inflation rate from 50 percent to 10 percent by 1995 and double income per person to about $200 and increase exports fivefold by the year 2000. ""We are still among the poorest nations of the world,"" the plan says. Jane Werner, an associate research scholar at Columbia University, expects that steps toward normalization of relations with the United States next year will help Vietnam compensate for the loss of Soviet aid. Several American companies want Vietnamese business. British Airways Reaches Out  British Airways is finding its way from England to Europe without the help of the channel tunnel. The company said last week that it wants to join German investors in forming a new Berlin-based airline that will give Lufthansa more competition. It already has asked the European Commission's approval for sharing ownership of the Belgian airline, Sabena, with Dutch and Belgian partners. And, farther east, it seeks to start Air Russia in Moscow. Once a dreary Government-owned airline, British Airways has transformed itself since its 1987 privatization into an ambitious international competitor. THE ECONOMY   Jobs Down, Unemployment Up  The nation is losing jobs far more rapidly than economists or Federal officials had feared. Friday's reported decline of 450,000 civilian jobs caused many economists to abandon their hopes for only a mild recession. The November unemployment rate rose two-tenths of 1 percent to 5.9 percent. In the view of Allen Sinai, the Boston Company's chief economist, the latest figures ""suggest the cumulative, downward spiral that the Federal Reserve chairman said was not in evidence."" The Federal Reserve eased on Friday, and several banks lowered their prime lending rate from 10 to 9 3/4 percent. An Abrupt Halt in Trade Talks  European leaders faced with 30,000 rampaging farmers on one side and renewed trade barriers on the other have decided that sharpened pitchforks can do them more harm. The European Community refused last week to meet American demands for deep reductions in farm subsidies. Crucial trade talks in Brussels then came to a halt after four years of delicate preparation. Negotiators hope the talks will resume next year. The Plunge in Purchasing  The last time purchasing managers were so pessimistic, the nation was caught in the recession of the early 1980's. An index based on a survey of the nation's industrial purchasing managers fell to 41.3 percent in November, down from 43.3 percent the month before. Roseanne M. Cahn, an economist at First Boston, said that the index has already fallen below the level typical of a mild recession. ""I think it will go lower,"" she added. ""The weakness feeds on itself."" In Brief  Retailers reported slower holiday sales than last year. Sears, risking an intensified price war, announced that its everyday low prices would become lower still, with the usual after-Christmas reductions coming before. As prospects for avoiding a Middle East war improved, oil prices fell $2.27 a barrel to $26.58 last week. Economists said that lower oil prices would only gradually help pull the nation from a recession."

There will also be an auction of 161-day cash management bills on the same day the 30-year bond is sold.    By late Friday the three- and 10-year notes were trading on a when-issued basis at prices to yield 7.84 percent and 8.55 percent, respectively. The long-term 30-year bond was offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 8.69 percent. In the bill market, the outstanding three- and six-month bills were bid at 7.09 percent and 7.05 percent, respectively.

However, the end game of this affair is tricky -- and could take a lot longer than the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations resolutions calling for full Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the Kuwaiti Government and release of all hostages. President Hussein will doubtless seek to escape from some of those terms."

URGES the Government of Israel to accept de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the said Convention;    5. CALLS ON the high contracting parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to insure respect by Israel, the occupying power, for its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention in accordance with Article 1;    6.

In this context they agree that an international conference, at an appropriate time, properly structured, should facilitate efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement and lasting peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict.    However, the members of the Council are of the view that there is not unanimity as to when would be the appropriate time for such a conference.    In the view of the members of the Council, the Arab-Israeli conflict is important and unique and must be addressed independently, on its own merits."

Some troubled corporations are trying to cut both the time and the expense of bankruptcy reorganization by taking an approach known as the prepackaged bankruptcy.    In a prepackaged bankruptcy, the debtors and certain required majorities of each class of creditors and equity holders accept a reorganization plan before the company files for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. In such an instance, the company's management gives the bankruptcy judge a full plan that needs only the court's approval. This prepackaged plan generally results in a controlled and speedy reorganization, rather than the lengthy, expensive and treacherously unpredictable process that often follows a Chapter 11 filing."

The monthly budget gap was 21 percent higher than the $26.1 billion deficit of October 1989. The increase reflects the buildup of United States forces in the Persian Gulf and the rising cost of savings and loan industry bailout.    Military spending, at $24.1 billion, was up $4.9 billion, or 26 percent, from a year earlier.   Spending by the Resolution Trust Corporation to clean up bankrupt savings and loan associations was 10.7 billion, up 36 percent from $7.9 billion a year earlier.    Despite the five-year $500 billion deficit-reduction plan adopted by Congress last month, the Bush Administration has already conceded that the 1991 deficit will set a record.    In remarks last week, Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said he expected a 1991 budget gap of $250 billion to $300 billion, more if a shooting war breaks out with Iraq.    Red ink in 1990 totaled $220.4 billion, just short of the record deficit of 221.2 billion in 1986.    Government revenues in October totaled $78.7 billion, up 15 percent from a yearl earlier, while spending amounted to $110.2 billion, up 17 percent."

Russian citizens and American scholars wonder. President Bush last week approved $1 billion in Federal credits for the Soviet Union, lifting a 15-year ban on such aid with the goal of easing Soviet food shortages. The United States rejected European calls for full Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, saying the Soviets should receive only Special Association status pending further economic reforms. Many Soviets feel the kindest deed they can do for foreigners bringing money and supplies is to warn that their fellow Russians are cheats, profiteers and thieves. Using the K.G.B. to police food distribution is hardly reassuring. The K.G.B. officer trying to sell his high-crested hat to tourists one day is unlikely to to keep his hands off Western goodies the next. Dyed-in-the-Wood Gorbachev  Under the skin, deep inside, is Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev really another Brezhnev? A Khrushchev? A Stalin, or Lenin, perhaps? Moscow souvenir-hunters can count up the implications of the nesting wooden dolls of Soviet leaders sold along the Arbat, the pedestrian mall. They are a 1990's version of the traditional    matrushka    dolls, which, in Brezhnev's and Stalin's times, invariably depicted maidens, soldiers and other politically safe subjects. The doll vendors are evidently taking advantage of Mr. Gorbachev's encouragement of free markets, hawking Gorby dolls for $20 (hundreds of rubles).   Mexico's Telephone Sale For many Mexicans, a long-distance or international call means a trip to the Telmex office, an hour's wait and charges equal to a day's salary. Last week, the Mexican Government said it would sell Telefonos de Mexico for $1.76 billion to a group that has agreed to bring a donkey-and-cart system into the airline era. The sale, to Grupo Carso of Mexico, the Southwestern Bell Corporation and France Telecom is the latest sign of the country's willingness to accept American investment, according to Sidney Weintraub, a professor at the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. He added that the United States is meanwhile becoming more hesitant about the free flow of goods and money across its southern border. ""I find that role-reversal ironic,"" he said.  Post-Hammer Occidental  Maybe Armand Hammer kept going for all those years partly to frustrate the traders who always bid up Occidental Petroleum on rumors of his demise. He died on Monday at the age of 92, the day before his planned bar mitzvah. The stock jumped 1 7/8 to 22 5/8 on Tuesday. Dr. Hammer was long the Soviet Union's favorite capitalist; tour guides at the Lenin Museum in Moscow point out the small statue, a gift from Dr. Hammer, that still sits on Lenin's desk. At Occidental, Dr. Hammer ran his own command economy, purging top aides and spending company funds on an art museum to house his collection, no matter what other stockholders said. Analysts expect Dr. Hammer's patient successor, Ray R. Irani, to introduce perestroika, possibly selling the company's 51 percent interest in IBP Inc., a major meat packer, as well as coal and natural gas operations, to concentrate on chemicals and oil. In Brief  Eastern Airlines might still be falsifying its maintenance records, according to a court document released last week. Eastern and several employees were indicted by a Federal grand jury in July on charges of falsely recording repairs.  The strong German mark, it would seem, buys more in the United States. The largest German utility, RWE A.G., agreed on Thursday to pay $590 million for the Vista Chemical Company. The offer, $55 a share, was more than double the previous day's closing price of $25.    THE ECONOMY   Spreading Recession  The worst monthly decline in industrial production since 1982 confirmed the views of many economists that the current recession is unlikely to be mild. Output fell 1.7 percent last month, with automobile production especally weak. ""Almost every sector is declining now,"" said Lawrence Krohn, an economist at Shearson Lehman. He expects production declines to moderate but continue for several months. Not to worry about November's five-tenths of 1 percent rise in producer prices, he added. ""Anyone who looks for an acceleration of inflation given this depressed environment will be mistaken,"" he said. New England Bailout  The Bush Administration placed more than $1 billion in Treasury deposits in the ailing Bank of New England this year just as worried depositors were withdrawing billions. Treasury officials denied that the bank had receieved special aid. But the Senate Banking Committee and the General Accounting Office have opened their own inquiries. Retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in November -- no surprise to the store managers who are resorting to pre-Christmas sales. COMPANIES   CBS Dumps the Cash  The implosion of CBS Inc. continues. It was a premier television network with record and magazine businesses besides; then, a network with a huge pile of cash; soon, just a network with lagging profits and a smaller pile of cash. CBS offered on Thursday to buy back about 44 percent of its stock for $190 a share, using about two-thirds of its $3 billion in cash. The immediate cause was the need for the heirs of William S. Paley, the company's founder, to pay estate taxes. But some analysts said the company's president, Laurence A. Tisch, could find no better use for the cash. Or maybe, some said, Larry the Liquidator wants to trim the company down so it can be acquired in one easily digested bite. Mr. Tisch was greeted as a white knight when he invested in CBS in 1986. Now, some there question his colors. Equitable Passes the Hat  That man in front of a midtown Manhattan skyscraper ringing a bell and seeking contributions might be from the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. The needy insurance company announced last week that it plans to raise about $500 million by offering stock to the public. Like most other major life insurers, Equitable has been a mutual company, owned by its policyholders. Losses on ""junk bonds"" and real estate have forced the company to raise capital. Analysts expect other impoverished insurers to follow Equitable's examples. Power Over Cable?  Communities would have more power to limit the cost of cable television service under new rules the Federal Communications Commission proposed last week. The measures could be enacted as early as the spring. An Animated Separation  Call off the caterers. Cancel the hall. Mickey Mouse and Miss Piggie have broken off their engagement because their families just can't get along. The Walt Disney Company said on Thursday that it has abandoned its planned acquisition of Henson Associates Inc. and its Muppets. After Jim Henson, the Muppets' creator, died in May, some industry executives say, his five children became rather piggy themselves, refusing to reduce their $100 million-plus asking price. Disney maintained that buying Henson Associates without Henson was like buying Kermit the Tadpole. Kerkorian Targets Chrysler  With the Chrysler Corporation smelling like carrion in the desert, sooner or later a vulture was bound to appear. On Friday, Kirk Kerkorian, the takeover artist who rules his own arid kingdom of Las Vegas casinos and hotels, emerged as the owner of 9.8 percent of Chrysler's shares, which cost him $277 million. The Chrysler board did its best on Friday to make the company unappetizing, offering to sell new shares at less than market value if anyone acquires more than 10 percent of its stock. Some analysts say Chrysler is so weak that, to avoid falling prey to an enemy, it needs to sell out to a wealthy, protective friend. NCR Spurns A.T.&T.  NCR and A.T.& T. are taking their public battle to the stockholders. The NCR Corporation board unanimously rejected a $90-a-share buyout offer last week from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. NCR chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. plans to visit major institutional investors so as to urge them to keep their stock out of A.T.& T.'s hands. The telephone company, for its part, has threatened a proxy fight against the NCR board."

Mr. Abbas said the move was a surprise. He said the ejection was unjustified and urged Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, to reopen the camps and the group's offices. The Government in Tripoli has not given an explanation for its action, he said.    Reports began to surface about a week ago that Libya had expelled the Palestinians.    Arab diplomats in Baghdad said the United States had asked King Hassan of Morocco and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to press Colonel Qaddafi to eject the group. Pressure to remove Mr. Abbas increased after his group raided an Israeli beach in May, an action that led to a break in contacts between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization, with which Mr. Abbas's group is affiliated.    Colonel Qaddafi is believed to want Libya's removal from the United States State Department's list of countries supporting terrorism."

Shugrue Jr., the trustee of Eastern Airlines, contending that Eastern's program of offering first-class seats to flyers who pay full coach fare has resulted in strong bookings and better cash flow, is asking the bankruptcy court to let the airline withdraw an additional $30 million from escrow funds to keep operating.   The motion was filed yesterday with Burton R. Lifland, the chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court. In it, Mr. Shugrue argued that stronger bookings, along with stabilizing fuel prices, could enable Eastern to start generating enough cash from operations by February to avoid having to dip into the escrow funds.   ""The dramatic results of the initial weeks of Eastern's first-class marketing program, coupled with a decline in the company's cost of fuel and the success of the liquidity program, signal a watershed in Eastern's chapter 11 case,"" the motion said.   Eastern's unsecured creditors who heard Mr. Shugrue present the same arguments on Wednesday, however, are skeptical and could oppose further withdrawal from the funds, people familiar with their meeting said.   Judge Lifland set a hearing for Nov. 14 at 3 P.M. The unsecured creditors and the preferred stockholders committee, if they wish, can show cause then why the judge should not authorize the withdrawal of the cash.   Since Mr. Shugure was appointed trustee on April 19, taking control of the airline from Frank Lorenzo, the former chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, the unsecured creditors have generally been supportive of his attempts to revive the carrier.   The court authorized the use of $80 million at the time of his appointment, and in three following orders Eastern management was able to withdraw an additional $150 million.   Mr. Shugrue ran an advertising blitz to win back the business flyer in the summer and to promote the first-class program in the fall. Still, the airline has continued to have deep losses.   The unsecured creditors thus must decide whether to support Mr. Shugrue and approve more withdrawals from escrow fund, or to say no because there would be less left for them if the airline is liquidated.   If the unsecured creditors withdraw their support, then the pressure would grow to shut down the carrier and liquidate it. Two Primary Conditions    In the motion Mr. Shugrue said that there was still $257 million in cash left, which would be enough for him to shut down the carrier. But he said that would not occur.   Mr. Shugrue said that Eastern would need an additional $40 million between mid- and late December. Of that, $24 million would be to pay for aircraft leasing and $10 million would be for cash needs in January.   Mr. Shugrue's optimism, however, is dependent on two major factors -- that Eastern can continue to lure business flyers from Delta and other major carriers and that fuel prices do not begin to rise again.    Since Eastern moved its hub to Atlanta, Delta has become its major competitor. For a time Delta allowed Eastern to undercut its fares, preferring to keep a weaker carrier as a competitor rather than to push Eastern into liqudation and thus enable another major airline to come into Atlanta.    Recently however, Delta has matched Eastern's lower fares with lower coach fares. Selling More Assets    Mr. Shugure argued in the motion that during the first three weeks of the first-class marketing program the number of passenger who paid full coach increased by 4.3 for each flight.   He said that the program generated a lot of cash; adding one passenger paying full coach per flight brings in $4 million more in revenue a month.    He also said that Eastern's fuel costs appeared to have peaked on Oct. 16 when it was paying $1.24 a gallon. By Nov. 2, fuel had dropped 12 cents, to $1.12, he said, adding that every 10-cent drop represents a saving of $5 million a month.   The motion also disclosed that Eastern is in the process of selling more assets. The airline has negotiated an agreement to sell a hangar at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for $7.5 million, and US Air has offered to buy certain Canadian routes.   The motion also said that Eastern was negotiating with Aeroflot to sell or lease a number of its Lockheed L1011 aircraft to the Soviet airline."

A fine against the firm had been expected because it decided earlier this month to settle a number of cases without admitting or denying guilt, as is usual in settlements with the Big Board. That decision was disclosed to employees in a memorandum signed by George L. Ball, chairman of Prudential-Bache.    One charge was that the firm sold $218 million worth of securities it was required to hold for customers and used the proceeds in other transactions. Prudential-Bache was censured by the Securities and Exchange Commission for that act last October, but it paid no fine then. Many of the same factual findings are listed in the Big Board's action.    Also, Prudential-Bache was said to have failed to properly supervise an employee in its institutional block-trading business. According to the Big Board complaint, the employee sold stocks near the close of the trading day on an ""uptick,"" which is when the last trade is at a higher price than the one preceeding it.   The exchange said that the trades took place when the firm held shares for its own account and that the trades ""had the effect of increasing the value of the firm's overnight inventory.""

""We think it important to point out that none of the problems regarded issues involving customers,"" she said."

Among other things, large real estate investments by the complex empire under the Bronfmans' Edper holding company have soured, and the stocks of the main publicly traded Bronfman companies have fallen sharply on the Toronto Stock Exchange. While the two brothers, once known as the ""poor"" Bronfmans, continue to avoid the limelight, their senior executives have taken a road show to Bay Street, Toronto's financial district, to try to quell growing fears.   The Bronfman empire is so vast -- more than 360 closely intertwined companies with holdings as diverse as the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, the Labatt breweries, the Noranda natural-resources businesses, the Trilon financial-services companies and the Carena real-estate concerns -- that if it did suffer a serious setback it would have tremendous consequences on Canadian securities markets and on the economy, some analysts say.    ""Any trouble that the Edper group runs into would not be good for Canada as a whole,"" said Richard Lafferty, president of Lafferty, Harwood & Partners, a Montreal-based money manager.    All told, the Bronfman brothers control companies whose assets are valued in the tens of billions of dollars and that produce yearly revenues in the billions.   By some estimates, the more than 40 corporations in the Edper group that are publicly traded account for about 12 percent of the total capitalization of the Toronto exchange.     Investors are worried not only about the losses at some of the companies, which run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, but also about the labyrinthine structure of the holdings, private transactions among the various companies, and the large amounts of debt they carry. Preferred shares in each of the companies are regularly shifted to other affiliated concerns and it is difficult to tell how much leverage some of the companies have.    ""It's a pyramid scheme,"" said Stephen Jarislowsky, president of the Montreal-based Jarislowsky, Fraser & Company, Canada's largest money managers, with more than $11 billion (Canadian) from pension funds and investors under management. He was referring to the flow of cash in the empire, where many of the companies at the top depend on the dividends paid by those at the bottom for most of their cash flow. If dividends are not paid steadily, cash problems spread upward through the group.    ""They seem always to be shuffling paper here and there and I don't think any investor with any brains -- except for them -- can make head or tails out of it,"" said Mr. Jarislowsky, who added that it takes months of number-crunching to understand the value of the Edper assets and precisely how and by whom they are held.    The Bronfman brothers declined to be interviewed, but Edper executives took umbrage at this assessment. ""I don't know that pyramid is the right word,"" said Trevor Eyton, president and chief executive of Brascan Ltd., one of the main holding companies within the Edper group. ""We call it top-down financing,"" he said, acknowledging that it is the bottom-up cash flow in the empire that worries analysts.    Edper Holdings, the group's top holding company, is 54 percent owned by Peter F. Bronfman, 61 years old, and his family. The balance is held by the Pagurian Corporation, which holds the interests of top Edper executives. Edper Enterprises, which falls directly below the top holding company, is 70 percent owned by Edper Holdings and 25 percent by Edward M. Bronfman, 62.  A Family Dispute     Edper, which takes its name from the family trusts set up for the two brothers, was initially financed with cash raised by selling the interests these Bronfmans had in the Seagram Company. Seagram is controlled by Edgar M. Bronfman and his brother, Charles R. Bronfman. Their Toronto cousins were shut out from executive management of the family liquor business because of a rivalry between Samuel Bronfman, the founder of the whiskey dynasty and father of Edgar and Charles, and his brother Allan, father of Edward and Peter.    The Edper companies, and indeed most of Peter and Edward Bronfman's holdings, are run by Jack L. Cockwell, a reticent South African accountant who put together most of the empire and is widely regarded as the financial whiz behind its business deals. Mr. Cockwell, who is vice president and chief operating officer of Brascan, declined to be interviewed for this article. The 49-year-old accountant is highly respected in Canadian business circles for his financial skills as well as his vision, but he remains mysterious and aloof.    But as the Edper companies run into trouble, some Canadian analysts and institutional investors have asked him and other top Edper executives to give the public a better view of the companies' dealings and structure so that their value can be better assessed. (Disclosure requirements for public companies in Canada are markedly less demanding than those in the United States.) According to executives, the Edper group has declined such invitations, and that reluctance continues to fuel concern.  Some Debt Downgraded     ""We don't know as analysts how much money they have,"" said Phillip Wright, who is with McNeil Mantha, a small Toronto firm. He said the companies often mixed cash and securities on their balance sheets without outlining that much of these securities were notes from affiliated companies.   Late last month, major rating agencies downgraded the long-term debt of several interlocked companies, and operating expenses exceed operating income at at least two of the companies in the group. As a result, the stocks of Edper, Hees International Bancorp Inc., Brascan, Carena Development and Bramalea Ltd. have fallen sharply in the last several weeks.    A few weeks ago the real estate arm of the group was battered when news that Bramalea, a subsidiary of Trizec, would take a $115.2 million writedown on third-quarter earnings because of soured Toronto land investments. The charge gave Bramalea, which has spent nearly $1 billion over the last two years to acquire land, a net loss of $68.8 million for the first nine months of this year.  Short on Liquid Assets     Trizec reported last month that its income had fallen 60.2 percent from the corresponding nine-month period in 1989. Trizec holds many highly valuable assets but real estate experts who have worked with the company point out that it is suffering from a lack of liquid assets at a time when real estate values are falling and market financing is scarce.    Beyond the real estate troubles, the Edper group has stumbled in financial services. Royal Trustco Ltd., the group's trust company (whose main business is making residential mortgages) and the largest trust company in Canada, has seen its bottom line and stock price suffer after it made bold forays into the London real estate market and the United States savings and loan markets. Royal Trustco's stock, which has been sliding for four months, is now trading below book value, and earnings potential over the near-term is dim, some analysts said.    And Hees Bancorp Inc., the merchant banking operation, has watched its stock fall because of troubled investments in real estate and natural resources. In addition, the company has had a difficult time drumming up profitable merchant banking deals, said Eric Sprott, head of Toronto-based Sprott Securities.    The Edper group has also garnered unwanted attention from its interests in troubled companies it is trying to turn around, including the BCE Development Corporation, Unicorp Canada, the Enfield Corporation and National Business Systems Inc. Short on Dividend Cash     In its natural resources and mining group, Noranda Inc. is operating at about break-even, hurt by low commodity prices. Noranda is controlled by Brascan Ltd., one of the important holding companies, which is itself facing a $50 million cash shortfall.   Brascan reports paper profits based on its share of the profits of companies like Noranda and John Labatt Ltd., the food and drink company it controls. Even so, Brascan has for many years not had enough cash to pay its dividend commitments and has to borrow to make the payments.    The Edper group has paid very little in taxes for years because the companies and their managers hold their interests in the empire largely through shares of preferred stock. Under Canadian law in force at the time the arrangements were made, companies that held preferred shares in other companies did not pay taxes on dividend income earned through these holdings. Hees, for example, paid only $5.5 million in taxes last year on net income of $248 million.    ""They've played a lot with smoke and mirrors and they've done it for years without paying any taxes,"" said Mr. Lafferty of the money management firm.    While there are some big problems with the Edper group, its resources remain vast, and many Bronfman watchers doubt that the companies will begin to topple -- although isolated assets may have to be sold to raise money."

The breakthrough in the tortuous peace efforts follows a series of meetings here this week, including a session between Mr. Savimbi and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union. Mr. Savimbi, who had been vilified by the Kremlin as an anti-Communist menace, also met with President Bush on Thursday. Pressure From U.S. and Moscow     Washington and Moscow have been pressing their allies in Angola to halt the fighting, which has killed more than 300,000 people and left the mineral-rich country in ruin.   The United States has shipped Mr. Savimbi's group, known as Unita, as much as $50 million in weapons each year since 1986; the Soviets have given the Angolan Government as much as $800 million annually, United States officials say.   Under the tentative accord, both countries will stop sending weapons once a cease-fire is signed, American officials said.   Mr. Savimbi said that Unita and the second-ranking official in Angola's governing party, Lopo do Nascimento, had agreed at the highest-level gathering on Thursday that the signing of a cease-fire agreement should be preceded by the setting of a date for free elections.   The two sides agreed that the cease-fire should be guaranteed by international observers, he said, and that outside military assistance would stop once the cease-fire accord was signed.   Mr. Savimbi said there was also agreement that Angola should be governed through a democratic system and that elections should be monitored by international observers. 'No Question' of an Accord     The Angolan Government official, Mr. do Nascimiento, asked for more time to confer with his superiors in Luanda, Mr. Savimbi said. But ""there is no question"" that the Government will agree in principle, he added.   At a news conference late Thursday, the American, Soviet and Portuguese participants in the talks said ""significant progress"" had been made but declined to elaborate.   A United States official, speaking on condition of anonymity, today confirmed the gist of Mr. Savimbi's account of the meeting.   ""Unita is optimistic that the remaining differences between the two parties can be successfully addressed and that signature of a cease-fire will be possible during the sixth round of negotiations,"" the official said. The talks are to be held next month in Portugal, the former colonial ruler of Angola."

The article says awards are limited to two companies in each category. If the purpose of these awards is to upgrade product quality throughout American industry, this limitation defeats that end.   The British have done it much better with their BS 5750 Quality Award, chartered by the Government and administered by the British Standards Institute. Under the BSI program, a company fills out a relatively simple form which covers some two dozen criteria: not only activities directly related to quality assurance, but also other aspects of company operations like management philosophy and employee training.   Applicant companies are inspected onsite. If they pass, they receive the award and can use its symbol in promotional materials and advertising. Recipients must be reinspected periodically to maintain their qualification. A major incentive to qualify is that most companies and the Government now limit purchases to vendors who have proved, through receipt of the award, that their products meet high standards.   The BS 5750 award has now been accepted as the model within all European Community countries for a similar program, designated the ISO 9002 award. It is run by the International Standards Organization for all types of industries. The standards for both the BS 5750 and ISO 9002 awards are strictly enforced, impose no limit on how many companies may qualify. The Baldrige awards, on the other hand, give both a publicity and bottom-line coup to one or two well-heeled companies (its application takes hundreds of hours to complete and requires a hefty accompanying fee) rather than encouraging quality raising at all levels of industry.

On Arabs,"  Following are excerpts from the report submitted to the United Nations Security Council by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on the Palestianians in the Israeli-occupied territories:     Palestinians have expressed a profound feeling of vulnerability at all times, whether in the workplace, at school, in places of worship or simply walking down the street. This fear was compounded by their view that there was no recourse to any authority, other than the security forces who were so often responsible for the measures inflicted upon them.   They have stated that they feel unsafe even inside their homes, which were frequently subjected to midnight searches, and during which entire households, including children, were beaten. It was said that arrests during such operations were common. A wide range of collective punishments had, they said, become routine during the past three years, such as curfews, the demolition of homes, administrative detention and the uprooting of trees.   A system of arbitrary and heavy taxation had been imposed, which if not complied with, might lead to the confiscation of personal property and even arrest. Furthermore, the Palestinians have complained bitterly about a number of longstanding Israeli practices: the taking of land, especially for Israeili settlements and the privileged access that these settlements were given to water supplies; the closure for prolonged periods of the universities, and the periodic closure of elementary and high schools, which, in the Palestinian view amounted to a denial of their right to education, and the overall economic exploitation of the territories.   Palestinians emphasized that their distrust of the Israeli occupation authorities -- be they the security forces charged with maintaining law and order or officials of the Civil Administration whose role affected most aspects of their daily lives -- had grown so deep that they felt that only an impartial presence, properly mandated by the United Nations, would be able to provide them with a credible sense of protection.   In this connection, many of them drew attention to the military observers stationed in Jerusalem at the headquarters of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization , and inquired why they could not be assigned to monitor the situation in the occupied territories.   While they expressed appreciation for the humanitarian efforts carried out by representatives of international agencies and voluntary agencies, they were nevertheless deeply frustrated that those organizations were prevented from intervening or unable to intervene more effectively on their behalf. Israeli View of Strife     During the past three years I have had occasion to meet with a number of senior Israeli officials in New York, and have frequently voiced to them my concern about the situation in the occupied territores. In discussions with me, and with members of my staff in the area, the Israeli authorities have maintained that measures such as administrative detentions, curfews and the closure of schools and universities have been carried out in order to restore calm in the territories.   Israel's position has been, and continues to be, that it retains exclusive control over the territories it administers. Furthermore, the Israeli authorities point out that even under the Fourth Geneva Convention it would be for them to maintain law and order in the territories.    According to them, their policy during the past three years has been to put an end to the unrest in the territories which, in their view, is fomented by elements from the outside.   They note that the security forces are adhering to strict regulations determined by the Minister for Defence and that violations of those regulations are punishable. In response to expressions of concern regarding the need for the safety and protection of the Palestinians, the Israeli authorities point out that the many Palestinians who have been killed by other Palestinians should be a matter of equal concern to the international community.    Had it been possible for me to end a mission to the area at the present time, it would have followed up on the discussions begun last summer with the Israeli authorities and the Palestinian leadership. The Israeli authorities indicated at that time that they would be implementing new measures in the territories.    It should be noted that, in the subsequent months, there was a decreased military presence in the occupied territories and a decline in casualties resulting from actions involving the Israeli security forces there. Practical U.N. Steps     Further, there has also been a reopening of certain academic institutions. Nevertheless, the essential facts of the occupation have not changed and the potential for friction and confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians has remained very high, as evidenced by the tragic events of Oct. 8, 1990. The spate of violent attacks that have occurred since then, with more bloodshed on both sides, has generated further mistrust and bitterness.   The issue before us today is what practical steps can, in fact, be taken by the international community to insure the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians living under Israeli occupation. Clearly, the numerous appeals -- whether by the Security Council, by myself as Secretary General, by individual Member States or by I.C.R.C., which is the custodian of the Geneva Conventions -- to the Israeli authorities to abide by their obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention have been ineffective.

The rumors are believed to have begun in the London markets.   The vague rumors tended to focus on recent losses the Equitable has suffered through its guaranteed investment contracts, which are high-yield bond-like obligations the insurance giant sold to institutional investors in the 1980's. Equitable, which has about $44.9 billion in assets, has already suffered a loss of about $1 billion on these contracts.

But on Wednesday, Michael R. Milken, the most powerful financier of his time, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, to be followed by 3 years of community service. It was the toughest sentence by far for anyone caught in Wall Street's recent scandals, from a judge familiar with the financial community's ways. Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood gave up a lucrative partnership in a New York law firm, specializing in antitrust law, for the relatively modest pay of the bench. She offered Mr. Milken the prospect of a milder sentence if he helped prosecutors snare others, but he is banned from the securities industry for life. Some mourn Mr. Milken's exile, saying that the collapse of the ""junk bond"" market since he left Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. proves how indispensable he is. But how much are those bonds truly worth if their value depends on the fate of one firm and one man? Accountants Go Under  Laventhol & Horwath ultimately couldn't even balance its own books. The nation's seventh-largest accounting firm asked for bankruptcy protection from creditors on Wednesday -- apparently the largest such filing by a professional services firm. The firm had a negative net worth of $6.9 million as of Oct. 13. It also faces lawsuits seeking nearly $2 billion over its handling of such clients as the P.T.L. ministry and its favorable feasibility studies for real estate projects that would have needed divine intervention to succeed. Those trying to collect from Laventhol at this point might do just as well directing their prayers to Jim and Tammy. Bad Mortgages at Citicorp  How can a bank lose by pumping out plenty of mortgages when the housing market is strong? As long as borrowers provide a fat down payment, why bother pawing through piles of their financial records? Citicorp's latest experience is providing some answers. The company said mortgages delinquent 90 days or more or in foreclosure have risen from 3 to 3.6 percent of dollar volume during the third quarter. Falling home prices, especially in the Northeast, are partly to blame, but Arthur P. Soter, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, also points to relaxed lending criteria. The surprise is that it happened at Citicorp, the nation's largest home lender. ""This is not some mad dash for growth by an inexperienced, wet-behind-the-ears player,"" Mr. Soter said. Citicorp has decided to take more care in verifying applicants' income and down-payment sources. But more loans might go sour. As Mr. Soter said, ""Problems related to real estate tend to have a fairly long tail."" Move Over, Wayne Gretzky The sports world's probable greatest money-earner was laid to rest in an oak coffin a week ago at age 29 in Canada, where he was bred. Northern Dancer's achievements only began with his victories in the 1964 Kentucky Derby -- a track record -- and the Preakness. At stud, he enriched his thoroughbred breed with foals, including 123 stakes winners, that won more than $26 million. His descendants included more than 1,000 stakes winners. Bidding by European breeders and Arab sheiks for his royal bloodline pushed prices for his yearlings past $10 million, and his stud fee to $1 million. ""He was a national hero in Canada, along with Wayne Gretzky,"" the hockey star, said Bernard McCormack, general manager of Winfields Farm near Toronto, where Northern Dancer rests. Wait 'til all the athletes concerned that their multimillion-dollar salaries are lower than someone else's hear about all this. Buyout Funds Reborn  Merger mania still lives. Forstmann Little & Company and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company are having some initial success in raising new buyout funds of $1 billion to $2 billion. CBS Plot Thickens  Maybe CBS should consult a script doctor to straighten out its tortured plot. The network is in the awkward position of telling affiliates about its weaknesses and advertisers about its strengths. CBS executives said last week that they expect a loss this quarter, and they asked affiliated stations to swallow a 20 percent, $30 million cut in payments to carry CBS shows. Instead of planning the usual three-day bash for affiliates in Los Angeles next year, with parties, invitations to spouses and walk-ons by network stars, CBS will hold a sober day-and-a-half meeting in New York in June just for station managers. Laurence A. Tisch, president of CBS, said increased competition for viewers and advertisers is ""changing the fundamental economics of network television."" CBS is boasting to advertisers, meanwhile, that it will remain the best way to reach a huge audience, with spots on ""60 Minutes"" likely to have as many viewers as a blanket campaign on cable networks. Air Fare Bonanza  The airlines might fill up their seats with two-fers, but barely have money to go on with the show. In a frenzy to retain market shares, the nation's airlines are offering free companion tickets, most until Feb. 28. ""The industry is going to lose a fortune,"" said Helane Becker, an analyst at Shearson Lehman. With the high cost of fuel, she added, ""A couple of airline companies are going to have great difficulty surviving."" Buy now, she said, because the deals are unlikely to last into March. THE ECONOMY   Easing Up on Bankers  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady promised last week to do more for bankers than urging them to be generous with loans. Mr. Brady, sharing the Bush Administration's concern that tight credit is choking the economy, asked regulators last week to go easier in examining bank finances. ""Use some judgment,"" he said. ""Don't overreact."" Bankers say they need an overhaul of regulations that fragment and restrict their industry, and Mr. Brady promised to recommend new laws by next year. Trading at a Crawl  A power outage halted trading for 94 minutes Friday at the New York Stock Exchange. Business was so sluggish that some said they failed to notice when trading resumed. Oil prices rose $2.12 last week, to $31.90, after President Bush's tough talk in the Middle East. What little other economic news there was last week was discouraging. Initial unemployment claims for the week ended Nov. 10 rose to 488,000, the highest level in seven years. ""An ominous sign,"" Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist of Hongkongbank said.  Economic Justice  The economic slowdown has struck some of the healthiest states the hardest, while leaving weaker states improved. October unemployment figures indicate that even with the auto industry in retreat, Michigan's jobless rate was lower than a year ago, as the agriculture and machinery sectors picked up. In Texas, farm exports and Mexican trade quickened before the jump in oil prices, leaving unemployment just one-tenth of 1 percent higher than New York's. And California, its defense plants and real estate ailing, has a higher jobless rate than the nation's. Fear of Science  Americans continue to shun advanced study in technical fields essential to the nation's economic health. According to a recent survey, only 43 percent of the 933 doctorates in mathematics awarded in the United States in the last academic year went to American citizens -- a record low. Engineering and several other sciences show similar trends. Many foreign students do stay to seek their fortune in the United States. But for top scientists and engineers, it is a scant fortune: a median starting salary for mathematicians of about $32,000, less than many Wall Street M.B.A.'s earn their first six months out. INTERNATIONAL   The Bush Mold in Britain?  Will Great Britain turn to a George Bush, of sorts, for conservatism with a lighter hand? After 11 1/2 years of unwavering right-wing rule under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, her Conservative Party chooses a new leader, and Prime Minister, this week. Michael Heseltine, whose challenge brought about her resignation announcement on Thursday, proffers a renewed role for government in aiding the poor, improving schools and reviving inner cities. But Mrs. Thatcher's resignation also throws the contest open to two members of her Cabinet. Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, is more pragmaticthan she is -- and, like Mr. Heseltine, more pro-European. Only John Major, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, might closely follow the Thatcher line. A defender of free markets and a critic of a federated Europe, he appears to be Mrs. Thatcher's first choice. Guinness in Spain  When Ernest Hemingway was in Spain, it is said, he liked nothing more than an aged Rioja. Guinness P.L.C. is betting that Spaniards and latter-day Hemingways will switch from sherry and red wine to beer. The London-based company last week announced an agreement to pay $1.02 billion for the Spanish brewer La Cruz del Campo S.A. Cruzcampo has more than a fifth of Spain's beer market, with the fastest growth and strongest profits."

The venture would be owned and financed equally by Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, and Nestle, which is based in Vevay, Switzerland. The two companies signed a letter of protocol to negotiate a joint venture. Nestle is the No. 1 coffee company in Europe and ranks No. 3 in the United States coffee market, where its brands include Hills Brothers, MJB and Taster's Choice instant coffee.    The initial investment is expected to total $100 million, the two companies said in a statement.    Nestle and Coca-Cola are especially interested in canned ready-to-drink coffee. Japan has by far the most developed market for such beverages, with annual sales totaling more than $10 billion. Both Nestle and Coke separately offer canned coffee in Japan, although their joint venture will not operate there. Coke's canned coffee in Japan, called Georgia Coffee Original, is presweetened and is usually drunk at room temperature or chilled.    ""We believe the ready-to-drink coffee market outside of Japan is basically underdeveloped,"" said Randal W. Donaldson, a Coke spokesman.   Coke could benefit from the venture by putting Coke canned-coffee formulations under the Nestle trademarks, Mr. Donaldson said; Nestle benefits from access to Coke's distribution network in nearly 170 countries. Exact details of the venture are still to be negotiated.    Industry analysts said the venture had great potential but was unlikely to have much short-term benefit."

In 1990, the average stock fund dropped 8.2 percent through Dec. 27 while Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost only 7.1 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which tracks mutual funds.

The cutbacks ""range from the top to the bottom of the organization,"" he said. Some workers have already been notified.   Fleet posted a small profit in the third quarter and has been profitable for the first nine months of the year. The Providence-based bank-holding company attributed most of the layoffs to the recession in the the Northeast.   Other reductions were part of a continuing consolidation since Fleet Financial Group merged with Norstar Bankcorp of Albany in 1988. Shortly after the merger, Fleet-Norstar employed 19,500 people. Today, it employs 18,000, Mr. Lougee said. The work force reduction was expected to save the company about $25 million.  "

But the stocky, white-haired Mr. Tanii, the president of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, is changing that stereotype quickly. And since last month, when he led Matsushita's $6.13 billion buyout of MCA Inc., and with it Universal Pictures (""Jaws"" and ""Back to the Future""), it would be hard to find someone in Hollywood who would not jump at the chance to call on Mr. Tanii.   With the deal, Japan's biggest overseas acquisition ever, the Osaka-based Matsushita became the second Japanese electronics giant to buy a studio in hopes that it will create a ""synergy"" between the company's Panasonic and National hardware and American-made software. No one, including Mr. Tanii, who rose through the company as an engineer, has described just what that synergy is. But once arch-rival Sony bought Columbia Pictures in 1989, it was a virtual certainty that Matsushita would buy a studio.    Now the question is whether Matsushita, known as the most cautious and conservative of Japanese industrial giants, will learn how to survive in the boom-and-bust world of Hollywood. Most experts predict that the company will have a lot of adjustment problems.    In his spare time, Mr. Tanii studies Buddhist statuary at temples around Japan. Asked recently whether he goes to the movies often, he paused for a moment and then said, ""Maybe I don't have that much time."""

Gates    Microsoft's Payoff   For Persistence   More than anyone in the computer industry, 1990 belonged to William H. Gates, chairman and co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation.    After seven years of unsuccessfully attempting to persuade PC users that his Windows software was the wave of future, Mr. Gates tried a third time this summer. He spent $10 million to introduce Windows 3.0 and managed to convince almost everyone that even if the program is not perfect, it is inevitable.   The 35-year-old entrepreneur's extraordinary success with Windows 3.0 underlined the increasingly vital role that software plays in the computer industry. And Microsoft's position today seems so strong that many industry executives are now convinced that it is Mr. Gates, and not I.B.M., who will set the direction for computing in the 1990's.    Since 1987, Microsoft and I.B.M. had been trying to persuade business customers to abandon their MS-DOS-based computers for the more powerful but untried alternative of a OS/2 operating system, which used I.B.M. hardware and special Microsoft software. But few users moved up.   So in 1990, Mr. Gates decided to improve the lot of the nation's 40 million MS-DOS users by evolution rather than revolution -- and Windows 3.0 was the tool. I.B.M. and I.B.M.-compatible computers may now be operated with a hand-held mouse and on-screen symbols, as is Apple's Macintosh, rather than by typing in commands.   Microsoft's growth has been stunning at a time when most of the computer industry has stagnated. Its profits jumped 47 percent, to $279.2 million.   The Redmond, Wash., billionaire has begun to shed his bespectacled-nerd image. He is building a lake-front home that will have a garage large enough to hold 80 cars, evidence of a passion beyond software.   "

In response, Congress passed a law in the 1840's requiring the Treasury to keep its funds only in its own mints and customs houses around the country."

For three years, they have been expanding operations, even as they worried that their new plants would produce much more than anyone wanted to buy. And, as these plants come on line, their fears are coming true. Chemicals used in the manufacture of hundreds of household items are once again in oversupply.   That hurts. Consumers might soon get a price break on things like drugs, soap, paint and plastic zipper bags, but profits are down at companies like Dow Chemical, Union Carbide and Monsanto, and some new plants are not being opened on schedule. Dow, for example, had planned to open a huge ethylene plant in Freeport, Tex., in 1992 but will wait until 1993. By then, Dow hopes, the demand for ethylene might again exceed the supply."

This, he wrote, has a ""deadening"" effect on American advertising.   I think there's a deeper underlying cultural reason that explains the difference: the attitude toward salesmanship. Many Europeans distrust salespeople because they don't believe selling is a legitimate career. Most Americans don't see it that way.   The advertising reflects these differences: charming understatement vs. ""hard edged and brand specific.""   It will be interesting to see which model, Old World or New, sets the tone for advertising in the emerging free-market nations. RICHARD S. SECLOW  Westport, Conn., Oct. 12"

The airtight boxes, which can preserve liquids for as long as six to nine months without refrigeration and have become a staple for products like Gatorade, Mott's apple juice and Hawaiian Punch, are made of layers of paper, plastic and aluminum. Environmentalists favor packages made of a single material, like aluminum, glass or plastic, over multilayer containers because there are no dissimilar materials to be separated before recycling. And with aluminum and glass, the material can be made again into containers, whereas the recycled drink boxes are put to more limited uses, like plastic lumber.  Wrapping Product in Flag     But in newspaper advertisements, and in pilot recycling programs in Rhode Island and California, the industry producing the boxes, known as aseptic packages, has tried to make the case that they are environmentally benign. The industry has even wrapped its product in the flag, noting that American troops in Saudi Arabia are drinking their milk from such boxes."

The Air Force study, disclosed today in an article in The Los Angeles Times, concluded that McDonnell Douglas would not be able to meet the cost ceiling of $6.5 billion on its current contract, which covers all development work and the production of the first six planes.    The study estimated that the company would spend $7.1 billion to complete the contract. The company's Douglas Aircraft division in Long Beach, Calif., is building the C-17 under a fixed price contract, meaning that it must absorb all costs over the $6.5 billion ceiling.    A loss of that magnitude would be a significant blow to the company, which is suffering from declining military budgets at the same time its commercial airliner business is struggling to recover from years of losses.    Don Hanson, a spokesman for Douglas, said the company believed the Air Force study's conclusions were incorrect.    ""Our estimate is that our performance on the C-17 contract will be at or near break-even when the contract is completed in 1994,"" Mr. Hanson said."

Even during the prosperity of the 1980's, the city lost about 150,000 factory jobs.    But to the surprise of some labor economists, blue-collar workers are not disappearing. In fact, despite the lost factory jobs, the overall number of blue-collar workers increased by 140,000 from 1983 to 1989, bringing the total to 740,000 last year. Blue-collar jobs of all types now account for about a fifth of the city's work force.    Still, in a city that has become increasingly dominated by what Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls knowledge-based industries, many of these blue-collar jobs require more training and more skills than the usual entry-level, industrial jobs. Workers who once might have worked on carburetors are now expected to care for computers and other sophisticated electronic gear.   This problem is a worrisome one in New York City, where already perhaps half a million working-age people are not looking for work, because they are held back by lack of education or skills. Indeed, only 25 percent of the city's young people have jobs or are looking for them, about half the rate of their counterparts in Houston or Los Angeles.    Construction work has been a quick route to the middle class, especially for many people just starting their work lives. But that industry, which had surged in the 1980's real estate boom, is now experiencing a sharp decline that has idled as many as 25 percent of the workers in some trades.    ""The more demanding jobs structure and an education system with a 38 percent dropout rate are on a collision course,"" Mr. Ehrenhalt warned."

The visit, which will be the sixth meeting between President Bush and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, is seen here as a confirmation of the good personal ties between the two leaders, who held their first talks even before Mr. Bush was sworn in as President.That theme has dominated descriptions of the meeting by aides to Mr. Salinas, who has staked much of his personal and political success on his ability to work as an equal with Mr. Bush in improving relations between the two countries."

What will a barrel of oil cost in five years, after the Persian Gulf crisis has presumably been resolved and any war damage has been repaired?    A relatively new financial instrument, the Salomon Phibro Oil Trust, represents a sort of popular projection of the 1995 oil price. Four units of the trust represent one barrel of West Texas Intermediate oil -- or, more practically, the price of one barrel -- in September 1995. At that time, Phibro will acquire four million barrels, auction them and split the proceeds among the holders of the 16 million units."

But changes in Britain's economic policies or in the parlous state of its economy may be much slower in coming.    At the moment, Britain is in the midst of classic stagflation: double-digit inflation, rising unemployment and declining gross national product. And, while Britain's economic forecasters are holding out hope of an orderly recovery, the expectations for that upturn are more often attributed to the natural economic cycle than to any particular policy prescription.   Mr. Major appears likely to reject one popular notion -- that greater economic integration with Europe will somehow smoothly restore Britain's economy to good health. In principle, economic integration is a good thing: classic theory suggests that freer trade should benefit all participants. But economic integration in and of itself is no more likely to cut inflation and increase output in Britain than Massachusetts' could escape its difficulties by unifying with California.   The British fascination with European integration manifests itself in the notion of linking the pound with other European currencies and eventually creating a single currency to supplement or even replace the traditional units of exchange. But such a return to fixed exchange rate policies -- and it was Mr. Major who pushed Mrs. Thatcher into entering the current European exchange rate mechanism -- carries at least as much baggage as benefit.   Because Britain's economy is not competitive with countries like Germany, maintaining the pound's assigned position in the constellation will take high domestic interest rates or direct intervention in foreign exchange markets or both. The first, which amounts to giving the Bundesbank a major voice in British economic policy, almost insures a continued slow domestic economy. That could well prove as politically hazardous for Mr. Major, who must face a general election by June 1992, as it did for Mrs. Thatcher. The latter tactic has been proved in many other countries to be extremely costly and of little efficacy for anything other than correcting short-term imbalances in foreign exchange markets.   When it comes to matters like the poll tax, change will come quickly from Mr. Major -- and the betting is that the tax will be scrapped. Imagine an American leader deciding to abolish the property tax -- which at least bears some relationship to individual wealth -- and to substitute a per capita charge that would not vary regardless of whether one's income was $10,000 or $10 million. It took extraordinary arrogance and insensitivity to believe that such a policy would be politically acceptable. Mr. Major will inevitably move toward raising revenue based on ability to pay.   Peculiarly, Britain's real difficulty is the same root problem Mrs. Thatcher found, albeit to a far lesser degree: an extraordinarily rigid and uncompetitive economy unable to produce goods and services as efficiently as trading partners. Mrs. Thatcher's biggest misjudgment was her belief that five years of monetary discipline would be enough to bring a period of strong economic growth after those policies were relaxed in 1986.   But after relaxation, inflation immediately shot up, to its current peak of more than 10 percent. In response, the Thatcher Government began to increase interest rates in late 1988, ultimately more than doubling the base rate to 15 percent and bringing economic growth to a halt. Now the country is mired in recession. The Confederation of British Industry recently forecast that the economy would contract by 1 percent in 1991. Unemployment is now expected to rise into 1992.   When the British economy was stimulated, the result was not higher domestic output but higher imports and higher inflation. For while productivity jumped in the 1987-88 boomlet, the most recent results on output per head in manufacturing showed only a 0.2 percent increase compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile, average earnings grew by 10.25 percent.   How John Major will address these most important problems remains to be seen. He emphasizes his opposition to inflation and his commitment to a classless society. He surrounds himself with bright young economists like Mervyn King and Gavyn Davies. He emphasizes that he is his own man, not a Thatcher clone or stooge. But success will depend on finding the path to freeing up Britain's economy, not only through strict macroeconomic policies and free markets, but through other avenues like education and training.   It's fine for Britain to welcome Mr. Major as part of a needed change. But it is an economic illusion for Britain to believe that its problems resided with Mrs. Thatcher or the rest of Europe or anywhere but with Britain itself. To proceed on any other foundation risks merely returning Britain to the unappetizing economic state in which Mrs. Thatcher inherited it.    "

A Kodak spokesman, Paul Allen, confirmed the talks but said they had not progressed to the stage of an agreement.   Kodak acquired Sterling for $5.1 billion in 1987. The company makes Bayer aspirin, Phillips' milk of magnesia, Midol pain relievers and other over-the-counter products. Its best-selling prescription drug is Omnipaque, which highlights body organs during X-rays and CAT scans.   But analysts have said that Sterling has not produced the new drugs or financial returns Kodak expected.   The Wall Street Journal reported that sources close to the talks said an agreement could be reached by the end of the year. Mr. Allen would not comment.   Ronald Nordmann, a securities analyst at Paine Webber, said Sterling's established credibility with doctors in the United States would be important for Sanofi.   Kodak's stock was up 37.5 cents a share today, to $41.875, on the New York Stock Exchange."

No one place is a perfect microcosm of the United States. But the Reading area reflects both the weaknesses and the partly offsetting strengths of the economically floundering mid-Atlantic region. While its large manufacturing base tends to reflect contraction quickly, Reading's economy as a whole is diverse, and occasional visits here may provide a look at how one city deals with difficult economic times.  Drop in an Important Gauge     Some analysts think recession has already put its clammy grip on Reading and the rest of Berks County. One important gauge is a drop in the amount of electricity used by industry. This proxy for industrial output has trailed 1989 levels in three of the last four months. And the unemployment rate, though below the national average, has climbed one and a half percentage points since September 1989."

Indeed, studying them can be a profitable way to spend part of a long holiday weekend, for after the first of the year little can be done to reduce 1990 taxes.    In the remaining five weeks of the year, taxpayers can ask a number of questions and act on the answers, which vary with individual circumstances. These are among the questions taxpayers might ask:    *With the top tax bracket going up to 31 percent in 1991, from 28 percent this year, would it be a good idea to accelerate income into 1990?    *Would giving an appreciated asset, like stocks, to charity be advisable? For people not subject to the alternative minimum tax, the full market value is deductible.    *Is more withholding needed to avoid a penalty for underpayment?   *Can more money be put into a tax-deferred retirement account like an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, or should someone with income from self-employment establish a Keogh plan?    The first step in answering these questions is to organize financial records well, and for people with an I.B.M. or compatible personal computer, the fastest, easiest, least-expensive way to do that is undoubtedly with Quicken, a personal finance program from Intuit. The new Version 4.0 tracks investments, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certificates of deposit and collectibles, and provides performance reports, as well as the information on interest, dividends and capital gains needed for Schedule D of the tax return. The program lists for $59.95 and is widely available for about $35.    For more detailed tax strategies, J. K. Lasser's Your 1991 Income Tax Software, which lists for $74.95, includes both the tax book ""J. K. Lasser's Your 1991 Income Tax,"" which has justifiably beenthe best-selling income-tax guide for generations, and a year-end tax planner program. Buyers may send in a coupon to get a free upgrade for the preparation program early next year after the I.R.S. makes available all the forms for filing 1990 returns. People who wait to buy that program will not get the planner. Companion programs for 24 states can be ordered for $29.95. The Lasser program reads Quicken files and allows users to transfer data from them.    The Lasser tax book alone costs $12.95. In addition, ""J. K. Lasser's Personal Tax Strategies 1991"" by David S. DeJong and Ann Gray Jakabcin (Pocket Books, $4.95, 349 pages) focuses on year-end strategies and begins with a tabular presentation that makes it easy to find the place in the book where one's particular problems and possible solutions are discussed.    Another program that may be valuable for people who want an on-screen expert to guide them is Andrew Tobias's Tax Cut, from Meca Software Inc. It is written by Daniel Caine, a tax lawyer, who provides an easy question-and-answer format for novices, as well as a built-in audit function to check the return. It allows users to transfer data from Meca's very thorough personal finance program, Andrew Tobias's Managing Your Money, as well as Quicken and Lotus 1-2-3. Tax Cut offers side-by-side what-if strategies and lets people who have a""mouse"" peripheral device use it. Companion programs for 10 states are available.    People who do not own computers or who are not inclined to such a hands-on approach, but who want enough knowledge for an intelligent discussion with their accountants, can choose from a number of books.   Ernst & Young's ""Tax-Saving Strategies 1990-1991"" (John Wiley & Sons Inc., $6.95, 229 pages) is a vest-pocket-size book from the accounting firm that can be particularly helpful in making year-end tax decisions. It is a companion to the firm's tax guide, which provides line-by-line instructions for filling out tax returns and which will be published later.    Another valuable book is ""Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies for the $40,000-Plus Household"" (Prima Publishing, distributed by St. Martin's Press, $12.95, 278 pages). The first chapter is filled with year-end tips, and subsequent chapters consider topics like home sales, marriage and divorce, travel and moving expenses, child- or dependent-care expenses, charitable contributions, investments, audits, Social Security taxes and estate planning. Mr. Block is a lawyer who manages to avoid legalese in favor of concise, clear English.    Price Waterhouse has also lent its name to tax-planning books and has moved from one in recent years to three well-documented books this year: ""The Price Waterhouse Personal Tax Adviser,"" which details year-end and year-round tax strategies; ""The Price Waterhouse Investors' Tax Adviser,"" and ""The Price Waterhouse Retirement Planning Adviser."" The trilogy is published by Pocket Books at $5.50 each.    ""The H & R Block 1991 Income Tax Guide"" (Collier Books, a division of Macmillan Publishing, $9.95) is a large-format, 512-page volume with instructions for filling out the 1990 return, as well as timely advice on the new tax law for next year and help in planning year-end strategies. It also offers advice for those affected by economic and global problems, like reservists called up to military duty, union members on strike and people laid off and conducting a job search. Buyers who decide to have their returns professionally prepared can get a refund on the price of the book if Block does the return."

The Congressional Joint Economic Committee, which requested the study, said in a statement that ""if Germany finances higher Government spending with higher borrowing, real short-term interest rates are estimated to be a full percentage point higher in the 1990's"" in the United States.   The study, by the Congressional Budget Office, projected that the rate increase in the United States could be six-tenths of 1 percent next year, nine-tenths of 1 percent by 1992, 1 percent by 1993 and 1.1 percent by 1994.   The committee said that much of the money the United States borrows comes from the savings of German people. That money helps to cover the Federal budget deficit and to pay for imports. If the German Government borrows more of those savings for its own purposes, interest rates could rise in both countries."
