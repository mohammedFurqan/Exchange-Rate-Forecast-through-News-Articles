But the words inside the balloons are startlingly different.   ''Aspice, usitatum automatum temporis emi!'' one says. Another exclaims, ''Nil quidem! Vetus enim televisificum instrumentum inerat.'' In the English version these balloons say, ''Look! I've bought a second-hand time machine,'' and ''No! There was only this old television set which is still here.''"

They bear an alphabet-soup array of names and have different rules, with some serving particular needs better than o thers.  One such program is the Qualified Voluntary Employee Contribution Plan, or QVEC. Obtainable only through an employer on a voluntary basis, these plans let employees deduct up to $2,000 of earnings from Federal income taxes, with the money invested and compounded taxfree. When authorized by the plan, proceeds may be withdrawn before the employee reaches age 59 1/2 or incurs a disability, but in that case they may be subject to a tax penalty of 10 percent of the amount received."

Under the previous cartel agreement the companies cut ethylene production to 1.56 million tons in the five and a half months ended Thursday."

The new price drops brought the total bond decline over the last two weeks to about five points, or $50 for each $1,000 issue. Three-month Treasury bill rates rose yesterday by more than two-tenths of a percentage point."

Andropov and his hold on power in the seven months since he became leader of the Communist Party.   Recently, he has not acted so forcefully nor looked so vigorous as he did in his first weeks in power. There are growing doubts among Western diplomats and analysts about whether he has the physical strength or political clout to move any more people of his choice into positions of power than he already has, and whether he can break the bureaucratic inertia responsible for the sluggish state of the country's economy.   Unless other events intervene, the party's Central Committee will meet for its regular summer session, a session that might authorize new appointments to the bodies exercising control - the Politburo and the Secretariat.   The Central Committee session will be followed on Thursday by a meeting of the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal Parliament, which has the power to fill the post of chief of state, vacant since Leonid I. Brezhnev died in November."

No formal statement was issued by the Israeli Government. But officials familiar with the thinking of Prime Minister Menachem Begin and other Cabinet members said they had never expected the Jordanian leader to come into talks and were therefore not at all surprised by the announcement. They said they believed the King's failure to move had effectively killed President Reagan's Middle East peace plan.

The founders sell some of their shares to the public and put cash in the bank. But financial strategy is coming full circle. Now, taking companies private is becoming lucrative and popular as well.   More and increasingly larger companies are buying back their shares and becoming closely held again, mainly through daring financial deals known as leveraged buyouts.   The latest case is Norton Simon Inc. A group led by its chairman and chief executive, David J. Mahoney, last week proposed a $1.65 billion deal to take the consumer products company private. Then last night, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, an investment firm that specializes in assembling leveraged buyouts, made a higher offer for a competing group."

For Luciana Castellina they may be the most important in decades, not because they will produce a change, but because they may be the beginning of change.   From such differing perceptions, both women have decided to put their names on the lists from which more than 44 million Italians will pick the next Parliament.   Not all candidates, if elected, choose to serve. Potentially votecatching names are often put on party tickets even if their owners intend to cede their places to the next person down the list if the proportional-representation system won them election."

Although the tax took effect only this spring, the Cuomo administration has already received many complaints from developers.  A delegation from the New York State Association of Builders met yesterday with officials of the State Tax Department to discuss possible changes in administering the law.   John Dugan, general counsel of the department, said it had been working closely with industry leaders. ''We know they have problems with it, and we want to see how we can make it easier for them to comply,'' he said. The department has set up an advisory panel on the law."

In front of the Pike Place Market on the waterfront, a crowd gathers to watch a young woman prancing and kicking up her heels in an improvised dance that goes on and on - sunshine and springtime are especially exhilarating to Seattle, used to melancholy skies and too much rain.   A decade ago, in the midst of the ''Boeing bust,'' when 100,000 people lost their jobs and about a quarter of them moved away from this area, a freeway billboard asked, ''Will the last person to leave Seattle please turn out the lights?''   This time, despite an unemployment rate that hangs on at 12 percent, nobody wants to leave Seattle. They like this city of parks and hills, with Puget Sound on one side and Lake Washington on the other; they like its easy and colorful and untouristy waterfront.  And they do not see much better job prospects elsewhere."

Specifically, according to a senior department official who asked that he not be identified, the antitrust division has internally raised questions about a meeting in early January in which top officials of the companies met in Geneva with the Saudi oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani. The subject was the slumping world oil market, which had led to sharp declines in crude oil prices.   Top executives of the four companies reportedly put pressure on Sheik Yamani to lower Saudi crude prices from what they considered an artificially high level. The Justice Department is presumably concerned that the meeting was part of an effort to fix prices."

Such an effort by the P.L.O. is believed to be behind its increasing attacks on Israeli patrols and the firing of two mortar shells at United States Marine positions near Beirut International Airport on Monday.   The Syrian Army, while not directly involved in any of the incidents, protects the P.L.O. Most of the 10,000 to 12,000 organized Palestinian troops and guerrillas are behind Syrian lines in eastern and northern Lebanon.   To engage the Palestinians, Israeli forces would inevitably come up against Syrian positions unless the Israeli Air Force destroyed Palestinian encampments."

Recently, he has not acted so forcefully nor looked so vigorous as he did in his first weeks in power. There are growing doubts among Western diplomats and analysts about whether he has the physical strength or political clout to move any more people of his choice into positions of power than he already has, and whether he can break the bureaucratic inertia responsible for the sluggish state of the country's economy.   Unless other events intervene, the party's Central Committee will meet for its regular summer session, a session that might authorize new appointments to the bodies exercising control - the Politburo and the Secretariat.

The memorandum, which was suspended by Washington three weeks after it was signed, calls for extensive Israeli cooperation in the deployment of American forces in the Middle East to counter Soviet military threats to the region.   The danger, the analysts say, is that renewed discussion of such a formal military alliance between Israel and the United States would complicate Mr. Shultz's efforts by deepening the suspicions of moderate Arabs over Washington's long-term policies in the region.   The memorandum was signed on Nov. 30, 1981, but was suspended by the United States the next month to express its displeasure over the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights."

A stiff new austerity program, which attempts to reverse the high inflation and external trade deficits of the Socialist Government's first expansionist year, has brought favorable comments outside France, but more doubt than confidence at home. Employing classical, non-Socialist deflationary tools, the plan, announced last month, has been accompanied by a rush on both the left and right of suggestions that the country is dangling at the edge of a deindustrialization process like the one experienced in Britain.   Although some computer predictions about the austerity plan's likely effects on the French economy give it chances of succeeding by the end of 1984, monthly figures released Thursday showed the Government was unlikely to meet its goal of 8 percent inflation for the year, a rate substantially higher than that of France's main industrial partners."

The program involves a reduction of 7 percent in Army manpower and what a military expert involved in the preparation of the plan described as very small cuts in French troops stationed in West Germany. Some generals have warned that the overall reductions would seriously weaken French conventional forces.   As expected, the Government plan, which covers the period from 1984 to 1988, provides for building a seventh nuclear submarine armed with nuclear missiles, France's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, three hunter-killer submarines, Hades tactical nuclear missiles and some tactical weapons systems. The plan includes the purchase of airborne early-warning systems, probably American-made Awacs surveillance aircraft."

The first glimpses of the contents of the diaries, published here by Stern magazine and the Sunday Times of London, present no clear present-day political orientation. But as skepticism about their authenticity grows, the fragmentary extracts made public so far have furnished signposts for the analysts who will be looking for a possible manipulation of history as the volumes are disclosed.   They say a central thesis that might be developed in such a manipulation by the East German and Soviet secret services would be that the West turned down opportunities to end World War II, prolonged the suffering it created, and holds the historical responsibility for the eventual division of Germany."

The official, Joseph Franceschi, Secretary of State for public security, stopped short of accusing right-wing extremist organizations, but other officials have privately attributed the fighting over the last six weeks to young extremists of the left and right wings and to apolitical brawlers who attach themselves to the groups.   The Government, comparing the protests with those of May 1968 when hundreds of thousands of students were in the streets, says the current demonstrations and brawls appear circumscribed. The crowds have not grown in size since April, no substantial support for the students has developed within the labor movement or the population at large, and the Government has reached agreements ending strikes with some protesters, notably medical students."

The Court said that one goal of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 was to facilitate successful reorganizations by permitting bankrupt companies to continue operating. ''The reorganization effort would have small chance of success,'' Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the Court, ''if property essential to running the business were excluded'' from the assets available to the company.   To that end, the Court said, Congress enabled the debtor company to get back its property, including property seized or repossessed by creditors before the bankruptcy petition was filed. ''Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended a special exception for the tax collector,'' Justice Blackmun said."

Disbelief was expressed by David Irving and Lord Bullock, British historians and experts on Hitler; Werner Maser, a West German historian; two of Hitler's former personal aides, and Charles Hamilton Jr., an American expert on handwriting who has just completed an 800-page, two-volume study called ''Autographs of the Third Reich.''   ''I'm sure it's a hoax,'' Mr. Hamilton said in an interview in New York yesterday after seeing three photostatic sheets from the purported diaries, including two bearing Hitler signatures. ''The whole story is a misbegotten prevarication. The forgers are probably luxuriating right now in the south of France.''"

Gromyko had been unambiguous in rejecting President Reagan's latest arms control proposal.   The agency suggested that the State Department misinterpreted Mr.  Gromyko's remarks, which he made in a news conference Saturday in Moscow. Although the State Department called Mr. Gromyko's stand ''unconstructive,'' it also depicted his response as an ''initial'' one and stressed its ''relatively restrained'' tone."

The plan, which is limited to companies able to win payment extensions from their foreign lenders, appears to be aimed in part at pressuring foreign banks into rescheduling some $15 billion in outstanding private debt."

About two million of Malawi's six million people are believed to have registered to vote for candidates bidding for the 101 elected seats in Parliament. As they have little final say over who the candidates are or what they stand for, the true test of sentiment will be the level of abstentions, reflecting apathy or protest.   Malawi is a one-party state run by a Life President, Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who has led the nation since its independence from Britain in 1964. He has done so in a manner described by friends as paternalistic and by enemies as harshly dictatorial, controlling both the political and the economic life of the country. Apart from the presidency, he also heads the Ministries of Agriculture, Justice, Information, Tourism, Works, Foreign Affairs and Defense."

Perelman, the estranged wife of Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc., asserted yesterday that she owns a 33.9 percent controlling block of the candy flavoring company's stock that her husband has long claimed.   The assertion, in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, cast doubts on plans by Mr. Perelman to buy the company and led to a $2 decline in the price of the stock on the American Stock Exchange, where it ended the day at $46.   ''Her claim to that stock is a joke,'' said Roy M. Cohn, Mr.  Perelman's lawyer. ''Every filing for the last six years lists him as the owner, and not once has she ever claimed any kind of interest in that stock.''"

SEEN DELAYING LATEST LOANS TO BRAZIL,"  The International Monetary Fund has decided to postpone for at least a month the distribution of some $411 million in loans to Brazil because of doubts that the country is complying with an economic austerity program required by the I.M.F., monetary sources reported yesterday.   The funds, part of $2.5 billion in loans promised by the I.M.F. for this year, were to become available to Brazil on June 1.  Monetary officials said, however, that a delay in the loans would not have any serious effects on Brazil's already beleaguered economy.  One of the austerity measures in its agreement with the I.M.F.  required Brazil to reduce inflation to an annual rate of 85 to 90 percent, but it has shot up to an annual rate of 150 percent, from 99.7 percent last year."

The target of this strategy is a new generation of European leaders who share none of their parents' experience immediately after World War II, when Americans and Europeans worked closely to form a military alliance and reconstruct Europe's shattered economies.   Government and private public-opinion polls show that these young leaders - known here as the ''successor generation'' - have a far less positive image of the United States, partly because their perceptions have been shaped by American involvement in Vietnam and by domestic crises like Watergate. Troublesome Implications Seen   Government and private analysts are warning that the emergence of a new, far more skeptical generation of European leaders, if their attitudes persist, has troublesome implications for future cooperation between Western Europe and the United States."

It has been seven months since Alice M. Rivlin, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, announced she was leaving this year. But Congress - specifically the House and Senate budget committees - has barely moved to seek, much less choose, a new director.   Asked where the selection process is, one Congressional aide replied, ''You've heard of that lovely place called limbo.'' Rudolph G. Penner, the conservative economist and budget expert from the American Enterprise Institute, is still the front-runner.  But as of last week, he said, he hadn't heard word one. He said he is keeping himself in the race, however."

Kissinger denied today that he had offered his services to both sides in the Presidential campaign of 1968.   A new book by Seymour M. Hersh describes the former Secretary of State as offering to share derogatory files about the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, with the camp of the Democrat, Hubert H. Humphrey, and offering later by letter to work for Mr. Humphrey at the same time he was giving the Nixon camp information on the Vietnam negotiations being conducted by the Administration of Lyndon B.  Johnson.   ''There were no derogatory files,'' Mr. Kissinger said in a telephone interview, ''only a compilation of Nixon speeches.'' ''There was no offer on such a file,'' he added. ''There was no letter to Humphrey. These are slimy lies. No one will be able to produce any evidence to the contrary. Let them produce the letter.  They will not be able to produce such a letter.''"

Camouflaging the lack of a substantive accord, the 10 heads of Government agreed that their Foreign and Finance Ministers would meet under ''a special emergency procedure'' to draft a package of proposals to be submitted to the next Common Market summit meeting in Athens in December.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who strove to keep the meeting from breaking up in open disagreement, acknowledged at a news conference that its outcome ''gave no reason to be excessively joyful.'' But he expressed the hope that a ''process'' had been started that could lead to wider agreement."

S. lost his job and was unable to keep up the loan payments,'' begins a case history from the Legal Aid Society. ''The creditor is now seizing the car and household furnishings. They are taking the furniture several pieces at a time on different days. Essentially, they appear to be doing this to force Mr. S. to make payments on the loan.''   Whether he knew it or not, ''Mr. S.'' had signed a loan contract giving the creditor a blanket security interest in his household goods, which include pots, pans, the baby's crib and the family Bible. These goods rarely have significant resale value, but they usually have great psychological value to their owners. Finance companies, banks and credit unions use the security interests to ''threaten the consumer with extreme deprivation to induce the consumer to acquiesce to the creditor's demands, whether or not the demands are reasonable,'' according to a Federal Trade Commission staff report.   The F.T.C. staff has urged that such credit practices be made illegal. But the self-styled ''deregulators'' now managing the commission are showing no signs of wanting to approve the change.  ''Consumers are not as ignorant as you might suspect,'' said Wendy Lee Gramm, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Economics, implying that people could shop around for the best loan contract."

The country's spending in the first quarter of 1983 has grown far beyond the guidelines established with the International Monetary Fund, which sponsored the rescue package along with the United States Treasury and a consortium of European and American banks, and an I.M.F. official from Washington is in Brasilia, the capital, asking for explanations.   ''The program really only got started in March, and the I.M.F. may have overlooked the fact that it takes time for exports and payments of this type to generate cash surpluses,'' said Antonio Gebauer, vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and the principal American banking figure in the international operation of assistance to Brazil. Alarm on Public Deficit   He added, however, that the country would have to get ''tougher'' with the giant state companies whose debts have swollen the public deficit to a point that has alarmed the I.M.F.   Brazilian officials are telling their creditor banks that they require at least $1.5 billion to overcome cash-flow problems between now and June. More pessimistic estimates in the banking community put the country's needs at $3 billion to $4 billion."

The statement was an unusual departure from Red Cross practice of not making charges public. The private, all-Swiss committee said it had decided to speak out because Iran and Iraq had ignored appeals to cease ''grave and repeated violations of international humanitarian law'' during their war, which began in September 1980."

Mr. Arafat was expected in Amman last Sunday for a long-awaited meeting with King Hussein, but instead of coming directly to the Jordanian capital he traveled around the eastern Arab world, consulting with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Bahrain and Kuwait and with senior P.L.O. officials in Damascus.   Now that Mr. Arafat has finally arrived in Amman, King Hussein seems to be taking his time about seeing him, apparently retaliating for the P.L.O. leader's tardiness.   Shortly after Mr. Arafat drove into the capital from Damascus in a silver Mercedes, senior Jordanian officials indicated that the Arafat-Hussein meeting was not expected to take place before Saturday. The King was reportedly busy tonight and intent on taking his day of rest Friday, the Moslem sabbath and Jordanian weekend."

The downward revision from an original estimate of 3.1 percent was a result of a sharper decline in inventories than had been assumed, however, and does not change the outlook for significantly stronger growth this quarter, economists said.   Several measures of corporate profits released today left a mixed picture of business activity in the quarter. The Commerce Department's preferred measure, profits from current production, jumped 12.4 percent from last year's fourth quarter, after having slipped 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The better-known measure of after-tax profits declined 4.6 percent after falling 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter."

Jacobs, the multimillionaire Minneapolis investor in undervalued companies, has won a short-lived battle with the Belzberg brothers of Canada to acquire the Bekins Company, a major Los Angeles-based moving corporation.   Bekins and Minstar Inc., a boat manufacturer headed by Mr. Jacobs, announced yesterday that they had signed definitive agreements for Minstar to purchase Bekins for $89.2 million, or $23 a share. In addition to the cash tender offer, Minstar has acquired an option from Bekins to buy 1 million unissued shares of Bekins for $23 a share.   Last Saturday, Bekins announced an agreement in principle to be acquired by a subsidiary of the Far West Financial Corporation, a savings and loan holding company controlled by the Belzberg family, for $21 a share. That offer came shortly after a $20-a-share offer for Bekins from Far West was rejected. However, Far West did not purchase any Bekins shares before or after this announcement, while Mr. Jacobs and three associates bought 9.4 percent of the 3.9 million outstanding shares of Bekins on Monday."

It was an unlikely pairing, but the rare convergence of two of the Soviet Union's most popular holidays drew some of the largest crowds in memory to Moscow's churches, parks, squares and streets.   Few holidays would appear as disparate here. Easter, the most important celebration in the Russian Orthodox Church calendar, is officially nonexistent and tolerated only reluctantly by the atheistic regime."

For years that has been one of the verities of middle-class economic life, ranking with the conventional wisdom about having a will and keeping receipts.   But many old beliefs about life insurance are being challenged by recent sociological developments. The archetypal nuclear family with a breadwinning husband, a housekeeper wife and several children is giving way to more two-income families, childless couples and single-parent households. And each category generates different insurance needs. So does the growth in other types of income support programs - such as pension and profit-sharing plans - that might supplement life insurance."

Within minutes of Mr. Foot's disclosure, which came more quickly than expected, two prominent party figures said they would seek the 69-year-old leader's job. They are Neil Kinnock, the party's 41-yearold spokesman on education, a Welsh left-winger who is considered Mr. Foot's protege; and Peter Shore, 59, the economic spokesman, who is perhaps best known for his passionate opposition to Britain's membership in the Common Market.   Roy Hattersley, a 50-year-old Yorkshireman, announced his candidacy for the leadership six hours later. He is widely believed to have the best chance of stopping Mr. Kinnock. Mr. Hattersley, Labor's spokesman on domestic policy, who has a large following among party right-wingers, urged on television that a bruising internal fight be avoided at all costs."

The P.L.O. chairman's failure to come back from Kuwait as scheduled appeared to quash any immediate hopes that the P.L.O. would grant the Jordanian King a mandate to negotiate with Israel on its behalf, or of working out a joint P.L.O.-Jordanian formula that might have permitted both parties to take part in American-sponsored peace talks.   Mr. Arafat had asked King Hussein for a recess in their negotiations Tuesday morning so he could fly to Kuwait for further consultations with his Palestinian colleagues. The P.L.O. leader indicated to the Jordanians when he left that he would be back by Thursday or today to wind up the talks and the Jordanians issued a communique to that effect."

Some are still hoping for a renewal of the Jordanian-P.L.O. dialogue on entering American-sponsored negotiations with Israel over the future of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.    Depending on their political viewpoints, some Palestinians hold Israel responsible for discouraging negotiations by continuing construction of Jewish settlements in the territories. Most blame the United States for failing to force Israel to halt the settlements.  Some pro-Jordanians blame Palestinian radicals for refusing to abandon their illusions and confront political reality. And some pro-P.L.O. figures blame King Hussein for resisting the creation of a Palestinian state and seeking merely to reoccupy the West Bank."

Foreign trade statistics recently released in Moscow show that income from exports of crude oil and refined petroleum products to Western Europe, the principal non-Communist market for Soviet oil, rose by 13 percent last year, to some $16 billion, using the official conversion rate for the ruble.   This represented about 60 percent of the Soviet Union's foreign exchange earnings, which the Russians need to pay for imports of grain and high technology from the West.   ''They evidently decided that they must earn a certain amount of foreign exchange for planned imports from the West, and are able to mobilize the additional supplies,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate director of Harvard University's Russian Research Center, in commenting on last year's oil-export drive."

The plan, according to the officials, called for the formation of a small paramilitary force composed mainly of Surinamese exiles opposed to the authoritarian Government of Lieut. Col. Desi Bouterse. The force was supposed to infiltrate the capital, Paramaribo, and oust the Government, the officials said.   Colonel Bouterse, who seized power in a military coup in 1980, is viewed by Reagan Administration officials as an unpredictable leader with pro-Communist sympathies. Last December his regime rounded up 15 leading opponents, including prominent citizens, and had them summarily executed, according to the Administration."

In an interview on the eve of the signing of the Israeli-Lebanese troop withdrawal agreement, the Lebanese President made it clear that he did not take Syria's refusal to withdraw as its final word and added that there was a good deal that Washington could offer to Damascus to help change its position.   (In Washington, a senior State Department official said Mr.  Shultz was inclined now to stay away from the Middle East for the present and let the Arabs take the lead in the negotiations over Lebanon. Page A13.) 'Full Support' of U.S. Sought   On the withdrawal of Syria's estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon - which is a condition for carrying out the Israeli-Lebanese accord - President Gemayel indicated that the Lebanese, acting alone, would not be able to bring about a pullout."

Some groups expressed bewilderment and others dismay, and still others said the Chinese action did not matter.   The cultural programs canceled by China in retaliation for the American decision to grant asylum to Hu Na, a 19-year-old tennis star, were all arranged by agencies of either Government. The sports events were arranged by Chinese sports federations and independent American amateur sports groups."

Many towns grew in its shadow, among them Levittown, Pa., whose 17,300 look-alike homes make up the world's largest, and most studied, planned suburban community.   The plant, with nine huge open hearth furnaces, was a model of postwar industrialization: A facility where steel was actually produced, as well as ''finished'' -shaped into final products such as beams or rails. But the open-hearth method has become outdated, lower-priced foreign imports are threatening and now the future of the plant, along with that of thousands of workers and the economy of lower Bucks County, hangs in the balance."

On Monday, the 30 issues that make up the key average soared 24.44 points as interest rates fell.   The widely followed indicator is now within striking distance of its record close of 1,232.59 set on May 6.  Analysts said that the news announced in midafternoon yesterday that auto sales in the early June period climbed 21.1 percent from the period in 1982 fueled the late rally. This was regarded as additional evidence that the economic recovery was still in high gear."

The Vatican did not explain its delay in making public a photograph of the meeting.

It is that Keynes's economics ascribes no special weight, long run, between public or government spending as compared to privately financed spending by business for investment. All that counts is total spending. There is no ''crowding out,'' no Keynesian criteria for resource misallocation as between public, private or investment sectors. In economic terms his theory imputes the same marginal efficiency to all spending."

Treasury Secretary Regan urged state governments and Federal regulators to hold off, at least for the rest of this year, on allowing companies to use a loophole-turned-chasm in the Glass-Steagall Act as a way into the banking business. He said this would give Congress time to decide for itself just who should be able to buy a bank. It might also settle the tiff between the Comptroller of the Currency, who has been quick to approve bank purchases, and the go-slow Federal Reserve. Mr. Regan's moratorium would exclude brokerage firms, which, he said, would still be allowed to buy S.& L.'s.  That's exactly what Thomson McKinnon wanted to hear. The Wall Street securities firm agreed to buy First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Madison, Conn., for $10 million, thus becoming the first broker to buy an S. & L. It won't be the last. After years of watching the banks gobble up discount brokers, the securities firms are starting to fight back. Merrill Lynch - Treasury Secretary Regan's old firm - as well as Shearson/American Express are looking more wistfully at the thrifts and their billions of dollars of deposits."

We are no longer the most efficient producers of steel or automobiles, and our lead in many of the so-called high-tech industries is being challenged by competition that we hardly noticed 10 years ago. Manufacturing employment, which represented 35 percent of our work force in 1947, is now down to 21 percent, and it may well further diminish to 13 percent by the year 2000.   American workers have long been accustomed to the support of almost unlimited capital, the best technology and highly trained management, which allowed them to outproduce lower-paid workers throughout the world. They no longer have this advantage. Technology, capital and management skills now readily flow across national bounderies. And in recent years, American workers have found themselves for the first time in serious competition with workers not only in Europe and Japan, but in Taiwan, South Korea and Indonesia as well."

While the economic advantages to private companies are clear, not everyone is pleased with the way the policy is being applied.   Instead of enforcing limits on each source of air pollution within an industrial facility, the E.P.A., under the bubble policy, allows one overall reduction target for each pollutant type - as if the entire complex were covered by a bubble. If a company can achieve the goal through some innovative procedure, it is encouraged to do so."

Friday night a mysterious radio broadcast, claiming to be the voice of the underground, announced that the demonstrations had been called off.   Unlike the weak, faltering signals of recent efforts by Solidarity's clandestine transmitters, which have been quickly drowned out by loud music, the signal of the broadcast Friday night was strong, clear and not jammed, suggesting that it was a lastminute ruse on the part of the authorities.   The broadcast was neatly devised to discourage any gatherings, saying the authorities had ''thrown into Warsaw herds of secret police who have carried out mass arrests and searches.''"

Anyone who earns income can deposit up to $2,000 (but not more than a year's earnings) and enjoy a double tax break: Deposits into an I.R.A. are tax deductible and earnings of the account are tax deferred.  But I.R.A.'s will not turn common folk into millionaires as some advertisements would have us believe. An investment of $2,000 per year at a 10 percent interest rate over 35 years would produce a retirement nest egg of more than $500,000. But if the inflation rate over that period is 8 percent, $500,000 will only have the buying power of $34,000 today. Nonetheless, an I.R.A. is considered an excellent way to save - and for many taxpayers, will result in twice the retirement assets that a non-I.R.A. investment would produce for the same annual outlay."

The Prime Minister, who called the heads of delegations from the 35 participating countries to his official residence Friday to present the plan, said Spain did not want to impose a solution but merely to expedite one in its role as host to the conference.   The 35 nations, signers of the 1975 Helsinki agreements on human rights, have been trying to review how the accords have been carried out and to draw fresh guidelines on issues ranging from human rights to new all-European disarmament talks.   While the two sides were bickering publicly the gap between their positions has narrowed. But neither has seemed willing to make any more concessions for an agreement."

Official's Comment a Factor   A major factor in the price decline was an early-afternoon report of a comment by a senior Administration official, who asked not to be identified, that the Federal Reserve might have to tighten its monetary policy because of the rapid rise in the nation's money supply."

It denied the charge.   The suit, in Federal District Court in New York, was filed by the bankruptcy trustee for the subcontractor, the Frigitemp Corporation, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in 1978. The action does not accuse General Dynamics' top management of playing an active role in the alleged kickback scheme."

The dichotomy between the two Keyneses is best illustrated by a comparison of Keynes's thinking after Versailles with the implications of the ''General Theory.''   Keynes had originally held the view that $30 billion was too great a burden for the postwar German nation to pay. But as Etienne Mantoux saw clearly, the newly reborn Keynes's theory supported ''the view that the payment of reparations would in itself have actually helped Germany to become the greatest industrial nation in Europe.''"

Speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the American Committee on East-West Accord, a private group, he called on the Administration to reestablish normal trade and to abandon both the quest for military superiority and for democratization of the Soviet system.   Mr. Kennan, who at 79 is widely regarded as the dean of American specialists on the Soviet Union, blamed both sides for the ''antagonism, suspicion and cynicism'' that he said now permeated their relations."

Are military developments in Syria part of a countdown to another Israeli-Arab confrontation? Or is the improvement in Syria's military position as a result of Russian arms transfers simply a means of reestablishing the Soviet Union's presence in the region?   There is general agreement among Western intelligence sources, however, that there are no signs that Israel, as the Kremlin has charged, is preparing for a spring offensive against Syria. On the contrary, there are indications that the Israeli high command would like to run down its troop commitment in Lebanon, possibly by thinning out the forces in the Shuf Mountains in the north."

However, soundings taken today among a rough cross-section of politically involved and also ordinary urban blacks indicate that the reaction among the section of the population that matters most to the African National Congress has been the opposite of what whites tend to assume.   The state broadcasting monopoly and the press, as well as the Government officials, have tended to emphasize black casualties and to assume a convergence of white and black reactions to the attack.  Thus on Monday, when Defense Minister Magnus Malan pledged to avenge the dead be they ''white, black or colored,'' The Johannesburg Star commented in an editorial deploring the cycle of violence that ''South Africans mourn the Pretoria dead'' and ''perhaps even exult in the swift revenge at Maputo'' - the capital of Mozambique, which had just been the target of a reprisal attack. Leaders in 'Homelands' Quoted   It was striking that the editorial drew no distinction between the reactions of whites and blacks. On a facing page, a headline declared, ''Black Leaders Damn Attack.'' That article quoted the reactions to the Pretoria blast only of officials in the black ''homelands'' that South Africa has created within its borders."

Jihad is an Arabic term meaning ''holy war.'' An anonymous caller told the Beirut leftist daily newspaper Al Liwa that today's attack was ''part of the Iranian revolution's campaign aginst imperialist targets throughout the world.''   The caller added, ''We shall keep striking at any imperialist presence in Lebanon, including the multinational force.'' The same group, in telephone calls to Beirut radio stations last month, also took responsibility for a series of attacks in mid-March on American, Italian and French contingents of the peacekeeping force. Nine Italian soldiers were wounded, one fatally, in the attacks, which stretched over three days beginning March 15. Five American marines were wounded March 16 when a grenade was tossed at them from a second-story window."

''The drop in oil prices has an effect on the whole industry,'' said George McCourt, liaison for exploration and production at Phillips Petroleum. ''There is likely to be a lot more competition among countries for the increasingly scarce capital for exploration.''"

Now, in a gesture of rehabilitation, the atheistic leadership of East Germany has embraced the father of the Protestant Reformation as the 500th anniversary of his birth on Nov. 10 nears.   In April, at a symbolic gathering at the Wartburg castle, where Luther hid from his persecutors and completed his translation of the New Testament in 1521-22, the East German Communist leader, Erich Honecker, declared that ''our socialist state considers it a noble duty to care for and advance the progressive inheritance of our people.'' 'Landmark of German History'   The Wartburg castle, Mr. Honecker said, represents a ''landmark of German history,'' and visits to it by East German citizens will ''strengthen their feelings of nationality and homeland.'' Mr.  Honecker then held an hourlong meeting with East German Protestant clergy.   The gathering at the Wartburg castle was one event in a panoply of Luther ceremonies, seminars, speeches, films, books and stamps in East Germany this year. East Germany has a near monopoly on Luther pilgrimage sites."

Ever since, newspapers and politicians here have been watching with fascination and occasional alarm the struggle between the Prime Minister and the elite, tradition-encrusted Establishment in King Charles Street, where British diplomacy is managed, just a few steps from 10 Downing Street. The Financial Times speaks of ''the decline of a proud department,'' The Guardian of ''a disconsolate department.''   Dr. David Owen, once a Labor Foreign Secretary and now a leader of the new Social Democratic Party, wrote recently of a ''yawning chasm that separates 10 Downing Street from the Foreign Office across the road.'' And Lady Falkender, once a key adviser to Prime Minister Harold Wilson, added that the Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym, ''is in such rapid decline that only a parachute will delay the inevitable.''"

But when Edwin J. Gray left last August to return to private industry, President Reagan and Vice President Bush were the co-hosts at his farewell party in the packed Roosevelt Room, across from the Oval Office. Edwin Meese 3d, James A. Baker 3d and Michael K. Deaver, the trio who run White House day-to-day operations, were there to raise a champagne toast, and the gifts included a set of glasses engraved with the Presidential seal. Even before the party began, the President slipped Mr. Gray a handwritten note, saying he felt a ''great sense of loss'' at Mr. Gray's departure for California. He also asked Mr. Gray to send a hug for him to the two teen-aged Gray daughters."

At stake in the short term is the future of aid to rebels in Nicaragua; over the longer term, the debate will help define when and how covert action should be an instrument of foreign policy.   Few subjects generate as much heat as covert activities, even one as overt as the Nicaraguan operation has become. The members of Congress who support legislation to cut off money to the Nicaraguan insurgents insist that the Reagan Administration is engaged in a secret war against the Nicaraguan Government that violates international law, common sense and a statute adopted by Congress to limit covert actions against Nicaragua. Both the House Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have voted recently to stop financing the covert operation. An Extra Dimension   Defenders of the covert activity say it adds a vital extra dimension to United States policy in Central America that supplements overt diplomacy and military assistance. Specifically, they say, aiding rebel paramilitary forces is the best way to fight Soviet and Cuban arms shipments to guerrillas in El Salvador and to inflict enough pain on the Nicaraguan Government to bring it to the negotiatiing table."

The video and audio tapes, transcripts of which were ordered unsealed by Federal Judge Spencer Williams in San Jose on Friday, show the two executives, Kenji Hayashi and Isao Ohnishi, explaining to the bogus consultants why Hitachi needed the International Business Machines Corporation parts and documents - to cut the time needed to develop their own, similar computer - and why time was of the essence.   The F.B.I. operation, conducted through a phony consulting firm, Glenmar Associates, lasted from August 1981 through June 1982 and resulted in charges against Hitachi, the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and 21 individuals. Guilty Pleas   Hitachi and four of its employees, including Mr. Hayashi and Mr.  Ohnishi, subsequently pleaded guilty of conspiracy to obtain stolen secrets and were fined. Tom Yoshida, a Santa Clara businessman who acted as an intermediary for Hitachi, pleaded no-contest on Friday to charges of conspiring with the two Japanese companies."

At the same time, the intelligence officials said the Soviet economy grew only slightly, had setbacks in agriculture and key industries and had inflation that cut into the standard of living.

''Off-price retailing is the fastest-growing segment of the business today,'' said Edwin G. Roberts, chairman of Dayton-Hudson's new off-price division called Plum's, the Elegant Discounter, which opened three California stores last month and plans to open at least six more before the year ends.   In addition, the Associated Dry Goods Corporation has announced that it will buy Loehmann's Inc., the pioneer fashion discounter, and K Mart is extending its ''Names for Less'' program to 100 stores.   The Zayre Corporation is also planning extensive growth in the field. It told New York analysts last week that it would expand its two off-price apparel chains, opening 30 T.J. Maxx stores and about 75 Hit or Miss stores annually for the next several years. This would give Zayre about 800 off-price clothing stores by the end of 1986, compared with 300 of its regular discount stores."

The few scholars who have investigated this modest emigration to Penn's Holy Experiment cannot agree whether the Krefelders were Mennonites or Quakers. While the Krefelders spoke German, some of their names - such as op den Graeff - are evidently Dutch, and Penn himself referred to them as Hollanders.   Until 1983, the Krefeld pilgrims and the Concord, the ship that carried them from Gravesend in England to what is now Philadelphia in 1683, were decidedly obscure."

Although the I.R.S. retained the maximum standard rate of 20 cents a mile for the first 15,000 miles a year, and 11 cents a mile thereafter, it established new rules limiting the number of miles for which the business-use deduction can be taken. This limit, based on the revenue service's projection of the useful life of a typical automobile, is now 60,000 miles, compared with the former limit of 75,000 miles - at 15,000 miles per year - for those who retained their vehicles for five years or more.

All Americans recoil from the prospect of war. All Americans insist on unquestionable defenses.All Americans accept the link between strength and peace.   And all Americans recognize the threat posed by the Soviet Union.  We do not believe that the Soviets are the misunderstood friends of freedom.

His departure after weeks of criticism by Salvadoran and and American officials over his handling of the leftist insurgency is only one of many developments that indicate the military and political situation in El Salvador has changed greatly since 1979.

Last February, a similar suit was filed against the First Savings and Loan Association of Suffolk, Va.  According to a news release issued yesterday by the F.S.L.I.C., New York and Suburban had $500 million in assets and was failing when it was forced by the agency to merge into another New York City institution, the Anchor Savings Bank, on May 29, 1981.

The worst development, some intelligence sources said, would be the ouster of Mr. Arafat by left-wing organizations such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, backed by Syria with the blessing of the Soviet Union. The sources said a consequence could be a more aggressive P.L.O. in which the number of fully armed battalions could be increased with Soviet help to at least five, from the present three.   A NATO intelligence officer said the flow of Soviet arms into the region was such that, ''if they wish, the Russians are able to equip 12 battalions with modern weapons.'' Palestinian guerrilla battalions are believed to consist of about 750 men."

But the Fed's quarterly flow-of-funds report showed that, despite the Treasury's strong demand for funds, interest rates were able to decline because the Treasury's needs were offset by weaker credit demands from businesses and individuals.   The flow-of-funds data, which are used by many economists as a tool to forecast interest rates, identify the sources and uses of capital in the economy much as the gross national product measures the output of goods and services from various sectors.   Net new borrowing in the credit markets was at an annual rate of $529.6 billion in 1983's first three months, up from $433.1 billion in the same quarter a year ago, the report said. However, the growth in Treasury borrowing was far faster: the Government sold securities at an annual rate of $179.1 billion in the period, up from $77.7 billion a year ago."

Not only would a default leave the bonds unpaid but also it could pose a threat to investor confidence in the nation's municipal bond market. Bond specialists estimate that investors who own the bonds - mostly individuals - eventually might get only half of the face value.   Following is a discussion of the utilities' problems and the uncertainty they have brought to the municipal bond market.  Q. What is the Washington Public Power Supply System? A. It was created in 1957 to oversee construction of electrical power plants and manage them for 23 municipal utilities and rural cooperatives in Washington State. When anticipated energy demand rose sharply in the early 1970's, the Supply System initiated plans to build three nuclear plants, known as Projects 1, 2 and 3."

Regan today called on Federal bank regulators to impose a moratorium that would prevent companies outside the banking industry from getting into commercial banking and would prevent both banks and savings institutions from getting into other fields.   This followed and amplified the move Tuesday by the Comptroller of the Currency to establish its own moratorium until January on efforts by nonbank companies to establish banks.   Mr. Regan said that while the Administration supports tearing down barriers between the banking industry and other financial businesses, it wants Congress to make the decisions, rather than various regulators.   The broader moratorium would prevent savings and loan associations and banks from moving into such nonbanking businesses as real estate, securities and insurance. In addition, such a moratorium would stop companies outside banking from setting up banks by using a loophole in Federal law."

Two senior Government spokesmen said, however, it was the view of the Reagan Administration that negotiations should be postponed until it is certain that ''daunting'' problems of treaty verification have been solved and the United States is certain it is willing to forgo the ability of blinding Soviet satellites.   Senator Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he interpreted the testimony of Kenneth L. Adelman, the new director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and of Fred C. Ikle, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, as meaning that the Administration would ''stall'' and avoid negotiations because of a desire to test and deploy a United States antisatellite weapon now under development and to preserve President Reagan's proposal for space-based defense against ballistic missiles.   The issue was discussed in a hearing of the Arms Control subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The subcommittee chairman, Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota; the full committee's chairman, Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, Senator Tsongas and Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, all urged that the Administration move more promptly to test the negotiating waters before a highly expensive extension of the arms race into space occurred."

South Africa sent its warplanes into a suburb of the Mozambican capital to exact retribution for a car bombing in Pretoria last week that killed 18 people and wounded almost 200. The African National Congress, the most prominent nationalist movement opposed to the white minority Government in Pretoria, said Monday that it was responsible for the attack.   The congress is represented here in various ways, and South African statements soon after the raid laid great emphasis on assertions that the warplanes had struck installations used by the movement to plan guerrilla tactics and had also knocked out a Mozambican missile base."

More than four years after the Vietnamese Army swept across Cambodia in pursuit of the Pol Pot forces, however, neither Angkor Wat nor the 75 square miles of ancient temples, tombs and palaces that surround it can yet be described as perfectly safe.   On a recent Sunday four American visitors to the temple complex heard dozens of shots ringing out. Since some of the shooting came from south and west of the temple, areas teeming with Vietnamese and Cambodian soldiers, the Government guide was asked if such gunplay was normal, if bullets ever struck the temple, and why nobody intervened."

It is as if a notion central to the continent's self-image - that a collective African resolve is capable of overcoming individual disputes - has been rescued.   Yet the manner in which the gathering was finally assembled has left some critical questions unanswered and has posed a new hazard.  In the process of debate, compromise and pressure that led to the summit opening Wednesday night, the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, was further alienated from Africa's mainstream. That probably removes the restraints, if any, there had been on his behavior and raises the possibility of a renewal of Libyan adventurism, perhaps in Chad, Libya's neighbor to the south."

Such an approach had been strongly encouraged in recent weeks by President Hosni Mubarak in order to generate momentum for peace talks before the United States, a pivotal negotiator in the Egyptian view, becomes embroiled in election-year politics.

The walls are paneled in genuine, not-too-highly-polished oak. The baseboards are of green marble. Huge oil portraits of Morgan's past chairmen peer across the chamber from gilt frames. An antique grandfather clock, with wood inlay, quietly ticks away the hours.   This perception of orderliness and this aura of perfection are the trademarks of the House of Morgan and of its two primary components - J.P. Morgan & Company, the holding company, and the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the bank.   Morgan is so well run and so profitable that it is the paragon of the banking industry. Bankers Trust openly tries to emulate it, and even Walter B. Wriston, Citicorp's supremely self-confident chairman, often uses Morgan as a model of profitability and a yardstick by which to measure how well a bank is run. Last year, for example, Morgan - the nation's fifth-largest bank holding company with assets of $58.6 billion - earned 78 cents on each $100 of average assets, more than any other of the 15 largest bank holding companies."

Mr. Reagan, speaking to the National Federation of Independent Business, said the Democrats were shedding ''an ocean of crocodile tears'' over Federal deficits and were seeking to impose a ''graveyard philosophy'' of higher taxes and spending.   The Democrats, he said, were practicing ''the politics of envy'' and were trying to pit one group against another with their proposal to place a ceiling on the tax cut so that families in higher tax brackets would benefit relatively less.   ''It takes a great leap of faith to trust the motivation and wisdom of the self-proclaimed champions of fairness who are now attacking the middle class,'' Mr. Reagan declared. ''The tax 'cap' is not a fairness bill. It's a jobs-destruction bill. It would cut off our nose to spite our face.''"

Shultz's plan for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon, has again cast itself as a spoiler of the American peace initiative for the Middle East.   Ever since President Reagan offered his proposals for a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians in September, the Soviet Union has exerted influence on key figures, including Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, to shun the proposals.  Arabs have been told that the Reagan plan dooms the Palestinians to ''eternal wandering'' without a state of their own.   In recent weeks Moscow has been directing its polemics against the effort to get Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian forces out of Lebanon, saying the provision of an Israeli-monitored security zone in the south of Lebanon would turn that country into ''Israel's hireling'' and provide ''a stronghold for a fresh United States military presence in the Middle East.''"

Adelman as head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, followed by an exchange with reporters, as recorded by The New York Times: OPENING STATEMENT   I am deeply gratified by the United States Senate's confirmation today of Ambassador Kenneth Adelman to be director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. It's my earnest hope that this positive step will mark the beginning of a new bipartisan consensus on the vital issue of nuclear arms reduction. I'm convinced that Kenneth Adelman will prove that the confidence which the Senate has expressed in him today is well-founded. Under his leadership we can look forward to a reinvigorated Arms Control and Disarmament Agency that will make an important contribution to our arms reduction efforts.   As we seek equitable and verifiable agreements with the Soviet Union to reduce the arsenals and the risks of war, we will need the advice and support of the Congress. I'm confident that with full consultation with Congress and the development of our arms reduction initiatives, the United States can continue to be a force for genuine peace and progress in the world. And if we're met with reciprocal seriousness of purpose from the Soviet Union, 1983 can be a year of historic importance in securing a more solid and stable peace through arms reductions. Helen?"

Usually the signing of an agreement between two nations marks a clarification of their relations and the beginning of a new, clearly defined era. Today's signing ceremonies here and in Qiryat Shemona, an Israeli border town,ushered in a new era, but it is one dominated by a sense of uncertainty about the future in Lebanon, Israel and the Arab world.   This is not to take anything away from the accord itself, which both sides hailed today as a scrupulously fair compromise hammered out with the help of the United States. Ink on Paper   In theory, the agreement solves everything between Israel and Lebanon. But in reality - for the time being - it solves nothing.  Unless Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization agree to conclude similar withdrawal arrangements, the Israeli-Lebanese accord will remain nothing but ink on paper."

The boulevard, which is Port-au-Prince's main street, runs past the busiest stores and the central market buildings, so the peddler who had his own little patch on its cluttered sidewalks regarded himself as being in the hub of things.   But the street life of Port-au-Prince and its unspoken, intricate rules have been disrupted as a result of Pope John Paul II's brief visit here in March. Because the Pope's motorcade was to pass along the boulevard, municipal workers trucked some 5,000 vendors, beggars and other street people out of town in the days before he arrived."

The bank's $20 billion t rust department, which held one million shares of Superior Oil for i ts clients, wanted to vote them against Superior's management in a p roxy battle. The hitch was that the oil company was also a customer o f the bank, so a vote against management in effect would be a vote a gainst one of the bank's own customers.   But Citibank decided to vote against management anyway, helping to circumvent antitakeover measures that Superior had adopted earlier in the year. Citibank officers felt that the measures were bad for its trust clients and ''undemocratic,'' said the bank's senior vice president and chief investment officer, Peter Vermilye.   The incident is one that is happening, with variations, more and more frequently on and off Wall Street. Institutional investors - which include trust departments, mutual funds, pension funds and independent investment management firms - increasingly are flexing muscles previously unused. They are voting against management and in some cases demanding a greater role in running companies. As one Wall Street investor put it: ''The power is there and power doesn't like a vacuum.''"

The dissident Palestinian officer, who goes by the code name Abu Musa, made his points in Arabic articulately and with the confidence of a man who appeared comfortable in his role as a rebel leader. It was clear as Colonel Musa and the officers around him discussed the reasons for their insurrection that they had in effect mounted a ''coup d'etat'' against Mr. Arafat except that there was no state apparatus for them to seize. Instead, they have taken over a cluster of villages and P.L.O. positions in the last area in the Middle East where the Palestinian guerrillas can operate with a small measure of autonomy."

But the unity sought by the United States was marred when Greece refused to sign the pledge and Denmark added a reservation.  Denmark's Defense Minister, Hans Engell, said his Conservative-led Government supported deployment. But he noted that the Danish Parliament had adopted a resolution compelling the Government to press for postponement of deployment in the absence of progress at the American-Soviet talks in Geneva. The resolution was proposed by the opposition Social Democratic Party."

The Treasury's outstanding 10 3/8 percent bonds, for example, rose about 3/8 point in the morning, and were traded at 101 3/8 before declining to 100 18/32, down 3/8 on the day, to yield about 10.31 percent.

The purpose of the trip, the officials said, would be to explore possibilities for easing negotiating deadlocks and to determine what lies behind Moscow's recently expressed interest in more normal relations,   But the prevalent thinking within the Administration regarding such a mission, several officials said, is considerably more cautious.  They said the notion of a Shultz mission to Moscow had not been broached to the Soviet Government because of disagreement within the Administration over the wisdom of such a mission. Mr. Shultz himself said Friday that so far there had not been enough progress on a wide range of Soviet-American issues to warrant any high-level meeting before the fall, when he is scheduled to talk with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.   Specifically, some State Department officials are said to have proposed that Mr. Shultz seek discussions with Mr. Gromyko this summer to deal with arms issues and regional disputes and to explore whether Moscow will move toward agreements on such issues as cultural exchanges and opening of consulates in Kiev and New York."

In interviews over the last three months, the opposition political, church and human rights leaders in the four countries, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, were virtually unanimous in saying they saw the decline in meetings, social invitations and sharing of information as a sign of a shift away from the human rights policies of the Carter Administration.   Adding to that impression was the lifting, soon after the Reagan Administration took office, of a number of trade and lending sanctions that had been imposed by President Jimmy Carter on the four countries because of political and human rights abuses. Shift to 'Silent Diplomacy'   United States embassy officials in each of the four countries countered that the United States remained committed to human rights in the region. The only change, the diplomats said, has been in a shift of tactics - from the Carter Administration's activism to the Reagan Administration's ''silent diplomacy.''"

Two articles in French newspapers made the point this week while Mr. Mitterrand was stressing the role of the United States' budget deficit as a cause of the world recession. One, in Le Canard Enchaine, the unusually well-informed satirical weekly, told of the Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, reporting sadly to the Cabinet that many third world countries no longer supported French positions at an International Monetary Fund meeting.

Competition would allow restaurants, groceries and other businesses - and even consumers - to own pay phones and to keep the revenue, rather than giving most of it to the phone company.

Analysts say that virtually every major drug manufacturer is focusing part of its research on vaccines, medications or diagnostic procedures to combat the disease.   While herpes is rarely life threatening to otherwise healthy adults, the problem is vast because of the number infected - as many as 20 million, or nearly one out of ten Americans, may have the disease - the psychological trauma the disease often creates, and the far more serious danger it poses when transmitted to newborn children or victims of cancer, heart disease or other ailments. Those who contract herpes can now expect to carry the virus for life, although not all carriers suffer recurrences."

Dealers said that activity was confined to traders and other speculators.

Even if the early May financing is less than $14.5 billion, analysts said it would be of limited help in reducing interest rates because future Treasury borrowing needs will remain huge unless budget deficits are reduced."

The Force was with ''The Empire Strikes Back,'' too, in 1980. And when ''Return of the Jedi'' opens this Wednesday at 800 movie theaters across the country, completing the trilogy that has accounted for nearly $1 billion in ticket sales so far, it will almost inevitably be the movie of the summer of '83. ''We expect it to be the biggest of the three,'' said Alan Hirschfield, the chairman and chief executive since mid-1981 of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, ''Jedi's'' distributor.   And it had better be, for the Force has not been with Fox for years. Since 1979, when Mr. Hirschfield joined Fox from a consulting job at Warner Communications, the company has been engulfed in an almost unending wave of contention and change, from infighting in the executive suite and rapid turnover to the $700 million purchase of Fox itself in 1981 by the Denver oilman Marvin Davis.   Last November, Fox was cut out of a cable consortium when Columbia Pictures Industries spurned it in favor of a stronger partnership with Home Box Office and CBS. When Paramount, Warner Brothers and MCA, which owns Universal, formed their own alliance in January, Fox became one of two studios - the other is MGM/UA - that does not own a means of distributing movies by cable."

As the men came abreast the place of worship, they stopped, removed their caps and bowed in brief reverence, gazing past the armed revolutionary guards and the hammer and sickle emblems of the new order toward an older emblem - the ornate cross of the Ethiopian Orthodox Union Church.   ''That sort of thing happens all the time,'' said a longtime resident of Addis Ababa, who, like most people here, offered to talk only in return for anonymity and thus protection from a stern regime. ''Religion was here a long time before Marxism.''   That much is apparent on Sunday mornings, when many of the 1.5 million people who inhabit this capital of high-rise buildings interwoven with shanties forgo food and drink to present themselves before the priests who officiate at ritual-laden services throughout the city. A missionary worker said church attendance in the last couple of years had blossomed, a kind of relief and quest for renewal after the darkest days of the revolution."

Congress recently moved to tax Social Security benefits of retired people whose incomes exceed a certain level. But maybe it should go further, suggests Allen D.  Manvel, a retired division chief of the Census Bureau.   In a recent article in Tax Notes, he said that all people 65 and older are eligible for an extra $1,000 personal ex emption and that 12 million people claimed such exemptions in 1980, at an estimated cost to the Treasury of $2.4 billion.   The basic problem with the exemption, Mr. Manvel says, is that it is available to all elderly, not just those in need. A recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, for example, showed that of all the 1980 tax returns filed with adjusted gross income greater than $1 million, more than one-third claimed the $1,000 exemption."

Disputing that tally with a wounded expression, Mr. Thebehali insists he was actually the choice of 295 of Soweto's inhabitants - none of whom, including himself, have an unambiguous claim to citizenship under the country's laws.   Since Soweto has a population of at least 1.2 million, Mr.  Thebehali's mandate can hardly be regarded as overwhelming, even by his own generous estimate. But it was a start, and he has been building on it ever since, using the limited powers conferred on him as the indirectly elected chairman of the Soweto Community Council to do favors for potential voters.   Since 1978, he says, he has met personally with 78,000 Soweto inhabitants to help them out of snags with the white bureaucracy, ease their housing problems or even counsel them on their marriages."

Six months later the commercial banks, which strenuously opposed allowing thrift institutions to do commercial lending, have little to worry about.

Under the Depository Institutions Act of 1982, federally chartered savings and loan associations can invest up to 5 percent of their total assets in commercial loans this year, while mutual savings banks can invest 5.5 percent of their assets. Next year the ratio will rise to 10 percent for both kinds of institutions."

The spokesman, Philip Wolfinden, the head of information services for the British company, said that his company's Ravenscraig plant in Scotland might be set up as a separate unsubsidized plant within the subsidized British Steel Corporation or be spun off as a separate non-Government company.   Removing the subsidies would solve a major problem in the steelmakers' plan. Under American law, imports are liable to limitations if they are from subsidized producers and therefore can be sold below production costs. Indeed, the American steel industry has relied on that law in recent years to win protection from steel imports, which have taken a growing share of the domestic market."

This brought the industry's annual selling rate for the month to seven million vehicles, the highest in nearly two years. Analysts welcomed the increase as a ''breakthrough'' to a ''new plateau,'' indicating that full recovery might be under way. Chrysler's sales were up 38.9 percent in the period, while Ford's rose 22.2 percent and G.M.'s 12.5 percent. (Page 29.)

But the total number of employed rose sharply, to 101,226,000, adding up to a gain of more than 800,000 jobs since December.

Military analysts speculated that one of the assaults Friday, on Santa Rosa de Lima, the key town in northern La Union province, was part of a campaign to take enough territory so the rebel forces in La Union and neighboring Morazan province could unite, dominating the entire northeast corner of El Salvador.   If they could do so, the region would become their largest contiguous zone of free movement in the country.  Residents of the area that was attacked, which included the Salvadoran border post of El Amatillo as well as nearby Santa Rosa de Lima, said the total destruction of five of six border bridges could lead to a virtual collapse of trade between Honduras and El Salvador and the consequent decline of Santa Rosa de Lima, which has been a thriving commercial center."

The public's approach to preventing nuclear war and reducing nuclear arms - by a margin of 64 percent to 25 percent, according to the poll - was to seek a mutual freeze on nuclear weapons with the Soviet Union rather than a military buildup by the United States."

Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testifies before the House Banking Committee tomorrow, he is likely to repeat often-made statements that monetary policy alone cannot guide the economy to a sustained noninflationary recovery. Rather, the Government's decisions on spending and taxation - its fiscal policy - must also be directed to the same goals.   In the present environment, Mr. Volcker is expected to say that smaller Federal budget deficits are necessary. The need to reduce deficits and Treasury borrowings will be most acute, he could say, in coming years when the competition for loans among consumers, businesses and the Treasury is expected to heat up and put upward pressure on interest rates."

A national opinion poll published a week before reported that the British public thought she would go down as the worst Prime Minister in history. Her monetarist policies were being blamed for an unemployment rate that had almost doubled in the three years since she took office. Her constant declarations that she would halt the decline of Britain and get it back on the road to health and prosperity fell on many ears as the sound of someone trying to drown out criticism with strong but hollow words. Speculation About Departure   And on that Saturday in April, during an emergency meeting of the House of Commons to debate her Government's failure to recognize the threat that led to the taking of the Falkland Islands by Argentina, the lobbies of Parliment buzzed with the prospect of the Prime Minister's departure in disgrace.   In less than 75 days all that changed. The British task force that retook the Falklands also recaptured for Mrs. Thatcher a confidence that she came perilously close to losing early that spring. Now, in a surprising recovery, her Government was swept back into office today."

Some officials said President Reagan may make a speech or issue a statement on purported Soviet treaty violations, making a missile test on Feb. 8 the centerpiece. But it would deal as well with American suspicions that Moscow has also violated treaties imposing limits on underground nuclear testing and possibly even the antiballistic missile treaty of 1972."

But the Pretoria blast, which killed 17 people and wounded 188 outside air force headquarters there, introduced a form of violence that has been to some extent grimly expected and often theorized about but never before experienced in South Africa.   An unofficial tabulation of acts of sabotage attributed in recent years to the underground military arm of the African National Congress, which seems to have tacitly accepted responsibility for the Pretoria bombing, puts the latest explosion in stunning perspective.  It appears to have been the 88th known sabotage attack since the start of 1981 and it did more damage than all the previous 87 together."

In response, the executive commission of the Brussels-based Common Market has already suggested giving Greece an extra $1.6 billion in special aid to strengthen its economy over the next five years. And other member states are likely to accede to the demands for more money as well.   In part, the strategy of Mr. Papandreou's Government is a reflection of the far-reaching poverty in Greece, where the annual average income is just $4,000 a person, the lowest in the Common Market. But it is also an effort by Mr. Papandreou and his followers, analysts say, to wriggle out of one of their more radical commitments without losing political face."

The maximum figure is lower than the 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plans to start deploying in Western Europe at the end of the year if agreement is not reached in Geneva.

They also grudgingly accepted large increases in inheritance taxes, a rise in payroll taxes paid by employers, special taxes on video equipment and a proposed cut in tax concessions for stockholders.
