In the long run, that legislation allowd local phone operators to compete with long-distance operators and vice versa. And those companies could also compete with cable companies, who, in turn, are faced with increasing competition from some home satellite firms as well as microwave broadcast transmissions.          As last week's acquistion of Continental Cablevision by U S West demonstrates, some companies hope to offer several of these services by themselves.
