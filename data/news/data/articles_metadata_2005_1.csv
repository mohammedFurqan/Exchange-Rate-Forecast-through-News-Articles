Because millions of Indians and other poor people -- including, by some estimates, half the AIDS patients in the Third World -- rely on India's generic drug industry, lobbyists for drug companies along with activists fighting for cheap drugs had descended on New Delhi to try to influence the outcome.

Taylor as under secretary for international affairs. [C7.]    Stocks Recover From Inflation Data  Stocks ended little changed as the biggest drop in oil prices this year led to a recovery from an inflation report. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.82 point, to 1172.53. The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.88 point to 1990.22. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 14.49 points, to 10,456.02.

[C9.]    Paxil Factory Woes Hurt Glaxo  GlaxoSmithKline's factory troubles are turning into a major financial problem.

The chief executive, John T. Chambers, said he was cautiously optimistic that corporate spending was improving, though he said the strength of that market would not be entirely clear until the fourth quarter. [Page C8.]    Preparing for Tough Sell on Budget  The chairman of the House Budget Committee, anticipating stiff resistance to the administration's new spending plan, told the White House budget chief that President Bush might need to consider his first veto to hold Congress in line. [A18.]    Older Workers Lack Means to Retire  Many aging workers who had expected to ease comfortably out of the labor force in their 50's and early 60's are discovering that they do not have the financial resources to support themselves in retirement. As a result, a lot more of them are returning to work. [A1.]    Taser Results Cause Stock to Fall  Taser International, the manufacturer of stun guns, said its sales and profit rose in the fourth quarter, but its shares declined as the results fell short of analysts' forecasts amid questions about the safety of its electric weapons. Shares fell more than 11 percent as one analyst cut his sales forecast for the company. The stock quadrupled last year, but has fallen 52 percent so far this year. [C5.]    Losses Widen at Mitsubishi Motors  Net losses at Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled to 228.2 billion yen, or $2.16 billion, in the nine-month period ended on Dec. 31. [C6.]    UBS, Europe's largest bank, posted a 12 percent jump in quarterly net profit. [C6.]    How the Advertisers Fared  A look at the highlights, lowlights and sidelights of commercials that ran during the Super Bowl. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C7.]    Microsoft to Buy Security Firm  Microsoft said that it planned to acquire Sybari Software, which makes programs aimed at protecting business computer networks from viruses, worms and other threats. [C8.]    Goldcorp Responds to Hostile Bid  The directors of Goldcorp responded to improvements in a hostile takeover bid from Glamis Gold by offering a special dividend linked to a competing transaction. [C9.]    Boeing Chief Expects Settlement  The Boeing Company's chief executive, Harry C. Stonecipher, said that he expected Boeing and the federal government could move as early as the end of this month toward reaching a settlement over several ethics investigations into the company's dealings with the Pentagon. He said the settlement would probably occur after the Feb. 18 sentencing of a former Boeing chief financial officer, Michael M. Sears, a central figure in a conflict-of-interest scandal involving Boeing and billions of dollars in Pentagon contracts. [C2.]    Stock Market Indicators Rise  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.87 points, to 10,724.63. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.58 point, to 1,202.30, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.65 points, to 2,086.68. [C9.]  "

Whitacre, the chief executive of SBC Communications, has amassed the country's most complete telecommunications company. Now he intends to add AT&T for $16 billion.    Mr. Whitacre riles critics who argue that he overpays and moves too quickly, but aggressiveness and decisiveness have marked his 40-year career. [Page C2.]    Hints of Oil Mergers to Come  After a lull since the wave of mergers in the late 1990's, the time for large-scale takeovers in the oil industry may be here again. One potential candidate is Unocal, which has substantial reserves, a strong portfolio of assets and a reputation for underperformance that has discouraged investors recently. [C2.]    Low Expectations for Auto Industry  Detroit continues to lose American customers to Asian competitors. Ford lost the most last month, with sales falling 4.9 percent. [C8.]    Secretary Wants Medicaid Changes  Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, called for sweeping changes in Medicaid that would cut payments for prescription drugs. [A12.]    Testimony on HealthSouth Numbers  A former financial officer for HealthSouth testified that he made up numbers to increase profits under the direct orders of Richard M. Scrushy, the former chief executive. [C5.]    Bankers for Bernard J. Ebbers once threatened to sell his stock in WorldCom unless it backed his loans, a banker testified. [C5.]    L. Dennis Kozlowski did not violate Tyco policy when he paid a $20 million fee to a board member, a former director said. [C5.]    Sharpton Urges a KFC Boycott  The Rev. Al Sharpton is joining forces with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to urge a boycott of KFC because of its suppliers' treatment of chickens. [C8.]    Lego Plays Rough in the Courts  Competitors to Lego, the maker of plastic building blocks, say the company is unfairly trying to use intellectual property law to dominate its market. Lego's last significant patent expired decades ago, so the Danish company zealously guards its trademarks and other intellectual property rights. [C4.]    Declining Oil Prices Help Stocks  Stocks rose, helped by strong earnings and lower oil prices. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 62 points, at 10,551.94. The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.29 points, to 2,068.70. [C10.]    China Loan Helped With Yukos Deal  China lent Russia $6 billion late last year to enable a government-owned company to buy a unit of Yukos, Kremlin officials said. [C4.]    Promise of a Shuttle Seat Is Gone  Delta Air Lines is now flying just one shuttle an hour from La Guardia Airport to Boston and Washington and vice versa, no matter how many people show up.

More than a third say their travel and entertainment expense accounts are getting greater scrutiny. With good reason, apparently: more than a third believe it is either ''somewhat'' or ''quite'' common for business travelers to submit expense accounts with ''one or more completely false or bogus charges.'' But most road warriors also disapprove of such fraud. Those in the United States expressed the strongest support (77 percent) for careful audits of expense reports and receipts, while 72 percent in Britain agreed, as did 70 percent in Germany and 64 percent in France. For all their stepped-up vigilance, companies do seem to be loosening up on restrictions against traveling in style. In a survey conducted by the National Business Travel Association and the Travel Industry Association of America, the proportion of corporate travelers who reported their employers restricted the class they could travel on fell to 50 percent last year from 56 percent in 2002. The decline reflected a better economy and ''a departure from severe travel restrictions'' put into effect after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the survey said.    UPGRADE UPHEAVAL -- As turmoil churns through airline elite-status programs, with many top-level members complaining that upgrades on major airlines have become more elusive this year, Continental Airlines is changing its upgrade policy to favor those who pay the highest coach fares and check in earliest online. Effective March 16, Continental said, priority for upgrades will be given to OnePass elite members traveling on full economy fares, based on elite status and time of check-in. Next in line will be those traveling on fares less than full economy, with priority based on elite level, then fare paid, and then time of check-in. The policy for companion travelers accompanying Platinum Elite members also is changing. Companion upgrades will be sorted by the status level of the elite member and by the time of check-in. For instance, Continental said in an e-mail message to its elite members, passengers accompanying a Platinum Elite member will be upgraded only after all other Platinum Elite members have received upgrades.    SHOPPERS' PARADISE -- Airport Revenue News, a trade publication, has announced the results of its annual survey of airport shops, restaurants and other retailers. Among large airports, Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport was rated first in overall concessions; Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport ranked first in best concession design; Orlando International Airport was first in customer service; and Newark Liberty International Airport ranked first in a category for unique retail services.
