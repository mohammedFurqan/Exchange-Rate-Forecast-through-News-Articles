The article relied on information collected by the National Association of Securities Dealers from its members; its estimate is based on stocks that actually trade.    The article also referred incorrectly to the filing of periodic reports by domestic companies on the pink sheets and the OTC Bulletin Board. Under N.A.S.D. rules, about 30 percent of these companies have to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. An undetermined number of others have to file the reports under S.E.C. rules, once they meet certain conditions.    A letter dated Oct. 15 from Harry K. Eisenberg, chairman of Walker's Manual, publisher of a guide to unlisted stocks, pointed out the errors. The letter was delayed in routing at The Times, and this correction was further delayed for checking with regulators."

It also agreed to make changes in the way it does business, including a plan to turn over authority for revamping its personnel operations to a committee chosen largely by outsiders.     The settlement came after two weeks of furor following the disclosure that executives had been taped planning to destroy documents demanded in the suit and disparaging minority groups. The Rev. Jesse Jackson said that the settlement was an important first step but that for now his call for a boycott of Texaco remained in effect. $(Page 1.$)    Time Warner Seeks to Halt Satellite   Time Warner is taking its feud with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to the skies.

Sales in the United States were so strong that Honda ran out of one model, the Civic, and will temporarily import Civics from Japan to augment North American production. Another Japanese auto maker, Mazda, reported improved results, too, although in its case that meant only a slim profit. $(50.$)    California Rule on Strain Injuries   California regulators approved the nation's first law intended to curb repetitive strain injuries, which afflict workers in fields from computer programming to meat packing.

The company also plans to buy a workers' compensation managed-care company from Beverly Enterprises Inc. for $87.5 million and repurchase as much as $100 million in common stock. In a tax-free spinoff, shareholders will get an as yet undetermined number of shares in Valuerx, which will be publicly traded.

Both Zapata and Houlihan's are controlled by Malcolm Glazer. Mr. Glazer's plan to spend $80 million of Zapata's money to buy Houlihan's created a outcry from investors, who promptly sued to block the deal. The investors won an important victory in September when the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled the deal would have to be approved by 80 percent of Zapata's shareholders, rather than a standard majority. Mr. Glazer owns a 73 percent stake in Houlihan's and would have received $29 million in cash from the purchase.   (AP)    KMART TO MERGE MANY CANADIAN BUSINESS FUNCTIONS  The Kmart Corporation said yesterday that it would merge many of its Kmart Canada business functions into its United States operations.

Approximately 200 positions will remain in Canada and a number of new positions will be created in Troy, Mich., where Kmart is based, the company said. It was not specific about the number of new United States jobs.

Bit 3 Computer had 1995 income of about $4.7 million before taxes on sales of about $12.5 million. SBS Technologies said costs associated with the purchase will reduce earnings in its second quarter ending Dec. 31 by $11 million, resulting in a loss for the quarter.

Made nervous by a weaker dollar, many investors sold Treasury securities ahead of today's employment report.    The yield of 6.50 percent on the 30-year Treasury bond was up from 6.39 percent on Wednesday and matched the highest yield in nearly a month. $(Page D13.$)    Asian markets reacted strongly to the bond activity in the United States and to the remarks of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. The Nikkei index dropped 3.19  percent and the Hang Seng index was down more than 4 percent in late trading. $(Page D6.$)    Circuit Breaker Shift Sought;  Dow and Nasdaq Make Small Gains   The New York Stock Exchange proposed making the circuit breakers that halt trading when prices plunge less restrictive than they are now -- though still far tighter than when they were introduced in 1988. The Dow industrials gained 14.16 points, closing at 6,437.10, and the Nasdaq composite rose 3.10 points, to 1,300.12; broader averages fell. $(D6.$)    Imported Cars Roaring Back   Japanese and European auto makers have come roaring back to the United States, by cutting prices and increasing rebates, moves made possible by the dollar's surge in the last year. Consequently, Detroit faces its toughest competition since the early 1990's. $(A1.$)    Chrysler Moves Reflect Success   With brisk sales of Jeeps and mini-vans producing a torrent of cash, Chrysler said that it would raise its quarterly dividend, buy back more stock and make management changes to reward executives responsible for its success. Robert A. Lutz, its president, will stay on past the retirement age of 65 as vice chairman. $(D3.$)    Nippon Telephone to Restructure   In a restructuring that would reshape Japanese telecommunications, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone agreed to split into a long-distance service provider and two regional companies for local service. $(D2.$)     N.A.S.D. Expels Stratton Oakmont   The N.A.S.D. expelled Stratton Oakmont, the Lake Success, L.I., brokerage firm, from the securities industry, calling it ''an ongoing risk to the investing public.''

The deal, which includes the assumption of $375 million in Coram debt, would create one of the largest companies that provide care for patients whom hospitals no longer find profitable. $(Page D2.$)    Stronger Profits at Oil Companies   Several major oil companies reported higher earnings as surging prices for crude oil and natural gas more than offset rising refining costs. Oil company stocks, which have rallied recently, were flat.    Texaco said net earnings jumped nearly 50 percent, compared with the third quarter of 1995; Chevron reported a 29 percent increase, excluding special items, and Exxon said profits rose 4 percent. The results met or slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations. $(Page D4.$)    Stocks Seesaw, Ending Down   Stocks seesawed, ending slightly lower after a morning rally following I.B.M.'s earnings report gave way to heavy profit-taking. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 3.36 points, at 6,090.87, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.07 points, to 1,236.41. $(D14.$)    Treasury prices fell slightly, weighed down by more than $30 billion of notes to be auctioned today and tomorrow. The yield on the 30-year bond edged up to 6.80 percent. $(D21.$)    Election Disappoints Japan Inc.   Corporate executives in Japan have been looking to the Government for two things -- strong leadership, and economic deregulation that would lay the groundwork for Japan Inc. to roar again. But last weekend's national elections will probably fall short of either of these outcomes. $(D9.$)     Few Issues Remain in G.M. Strike   Representatives of G.M. and the Canadian Automobile Workers union struggled with a few remaining issues in a 19-day strike, as G.M. temporarily laid off nearly 11,000 more American workers. $(D4.$)    Betting on the Internet's Future   The Frontier Corporation and Qwest Communications announced plans for a $2 billion national network to carry telephone conversations and data. $(D4.$)     United Airlines' Choice Questioned   United Airlines' surprising selection of Fallon McElligott and Young & Rubicam to share its $120 million account is raising questions about how well those two fiercely independent agencies can cooperate. But they voice optimism. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. $(D13.$)    RJR Reports Stronger Profits   RJR Nabisco Holdings announced that profits were increasing in its Nabisco food unit and its international tobacco business. But the company's results were marred by erosion in its domestic cigarette business. Net income in the third quarter rose 4 percent to $225 million, or 66 cents a share. Revenue increased 7 percent to $4.35 billion. $(D2.$)     Corporate Credit Ratings Improve   The rising stock market is having a very positive effect on American companies: corporate credit quality, as measured by changes in bond ratings, appears to be better than ever. So far this year, Moody's has upgraded the ratings of 221 companies, compared with 146 companies downgraded.

Officials said the ministers agreed to let the lira return to the currency grid at 990 lira to the German mark.    The lira had been dropped from the system in 1992 during a currency crisis in Italy, and re-entry was seen as crucial for Italy's hopes of being in the first wave of nations to adopt a single European currency in 1999. $(Page D2.$)    U.S. and China Agree on Visits   President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China agreed to exchange state visits in the next two years, the first such meetings since the 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square. White House officials also said that Mr. Jiang had signaled a willingness to move ahead on opening markets to pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. $(A1.$)    Settlement Reached in TLC Case   The singing trio TLC, their recording label and managers settled a yearlong battle over how the fruits of the group's success should be divided. The trio had filed for bankruptcy at least in part to void their contracts; the case was important to the industry, because the royalty restrictions that TLC could have shed are common in the business. $(D2.$)    Endless, Unattainable Love   Shiori Fujisaki is a 17-year-old high school junior, Shingo Hagiwara a 21-year-old college sophomore who idolizes her. One problem: Ms. Fujisaki, left, is only a character in a video game, the goal of which is to get her or a friend to date you and fall in love. ''Love simulation'' games have become a hot category in Japan's home video game industry, and Mr. Hagiwara, who is quite real, is one of a legion of young Japanese men who have lost their hearts to a virtual girl. $(D5.$)    Tighter Clean-Air Provisions Sought   The E.P.A. is recommending tighter national standards for emissions of the chemicals and particles that form smog and soot. Business groups are lobbying hard against the proposal to redefine how clean the air must be, saying it would cost billions of dollars to meet standards they contend offer no important benefit. $(A1.$)    Departing Editors Are Sued   When the publisher and 2 editors quit Orchard Books to start an imprint at another publisher, it seemed just one more industry realignment. But in Orchard's case, nothing has happened in the usual way since. $(D7.$)    Big Shift in Health Care Billing   After signing large numbers of New York doctors, the nation's health maintenance organizations are radically changing the way they pay physicians there and have begun to reduce reimbursements. $(A1.$)    Paper Guides to Internet Sites   At least 10 ink-and-paper publications are fighting to become, in effect, the TV Guide of the World Wide Web. And, as bigger and better-financed magazines jump in, the competition is turning into a demolition derby. $(D10.$)    Chat as a Marketing Opportunity   Advertisers for the most part have either ignored on-line ''chat'' or poked fun at the phenomenon. But a study suggests marketers ought to take those cybercommunities seriously. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. $(D6.$)    Michael Jackson's Global Reach   Though Michael Jackson's two-year-old album ''HIStory'' has failed to meet expectations in the United States, it remains a hit in dozens of other nations, selling 11 million copies worldwide.

But many investors in the largest segment of funds, those that buy stocks, have never experienced a significant market downturn. That raises questions among analysts about how such investors would react if a significant drop occurred. Market Place. $(Page A1.$)    Dow Average Rises 23.83 Points   Stocks advanced in a sedate session. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.83 points, at 6,546.68, just 1.11 points shy of its all-time closing high of 6,547.79. One analyst called the rise ''the traditional folkloric Santa Claus rally.'' Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 6.94 points, to 1,294.57. $(D5.$)    Treasury Securities Unchanged   Treasury securities finished unchanged in a quiet session, with traders reluctant to take positions in the absence of significant economic news. The 30-year bond yield remained at 6.58 percent. $(D4.$)    Gas and Heating Oil Futures Slump   Natural gas and heating oil futures prices slumped, as forecasts for mild weather across much of the country contributed to lackluster demand. Natural gas for February delivery tumbled 32.1 cents, to $3.384 per 1,000 cubic feet, and January heating oil sank 1.34 cents, to 70.06 cents a gallon. $(D11.$)    Dollar Advances Against the Yen   The dollar hit 115.08 yen, its highest level in more than three and a half years, before profit taking in a thin market trimmed the gain, sending the dollar to 114.66 yen. It was barely changed against the German mark. $(D11.$)    Workers Protest South Korean Law   South Korea's auto industry came to a standstill as 150,000 workers walked out to protest the Parliament's secret passage of a law that curtails labor's power. An umbrella group of unions called the strike hours after 155 legislators of the governing New Korea Party passed the law during a session at which no opposition members were present. If it escalates, the strike could be devastating to the country's economy. $(A4.$)    Japanese Banks to Forgive Loans   Major Japanese banks said that they would forgive billions of dollars in loans to the country's failed mortgage lenders, known as jusen. The banks said the decision would have little effect on their earnings in the current fiscal year because they had already set aside special reserves for writing off loans. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and the Industrial Bank of Japan are forgiving the highest amounts. $(D4.$)    Strikers to Be Compensated   The Government has told Caterpillar, the nation's leading maker of earthmoving machinery, to compensate thousands of workers who participated in strikes against the company and missed out on the free meals, flu shots, ice cream and popcorn the company gave employees who did not strike or who crossed picket lines. The United Automobile Workers union has engaged in two bitter strikes against Caterpillar in the 1990's. $(A18.$)    Short-Sellers Drop Intel Stock   Intel shares have surged 13 percent in the last six weeks, causing short-sellers to cut their positions.

Dispute in Canada Hinges on Issue of Control   The dispute between General Motors and the Canadian Automobile Workers union is a struggle over who really runs the company, which is making it difficult to resolve a four-day-old strike. After decades of seeking higher wages or better benefits, the Canadian union seeks a labor contract that will restrict many management prerogatives, like the ability to sell factories and shift production to low-wage, outside companies.    G.M. Canada's top labor negotiator said that it could not accept limits on corporate decision-making.

The Dow Jones industrial average declined for a fourth day, losing 43.98, or 0.73 percent, to 5,992.48. Other indexes gave up less ground.    It was the Dow's first close below 6,000 since Oct. 11.

A plane crashes, and the media go crazy, seeming to forget how vastly safer it is to fly than to drive to the corner for milk. A child dies from a fast-expanding air bag, and people forget the positive. ''What's getting lost,'' one safety advocate said, is that air bags ''have already shown their incredible payoff'' -- an estimated 1,600 lives saved, compared with 51 deaths traced to them. The goal now: save the 1,600 and the 51, too. The Transportation Department weighed in last week, moving to allow drivers to have air bags disconnected and let car makers come up with bags that inflate more slowly. Those both have their own risks, though, so other ideas are emerging, like ''two-speed'' air bags and even ''smart seats'' that sense the size of the passenger. Smart drivers might help, too.   COLD-WAR DEBRIS Plutonium Everywhere The cold war lasted a mere half-century, but its deadly debris will be around for millennia. Perhaps the deadliest is the plutonium from dismantled bombs, and the debate rages about what to do with the nasty stuff. It could be used for nuclear power, of course, but American leaders have long opposed that, fearing loss or theft or deadly mishaps. But now the Administration is on the verge of changing its mind, saying it's the only way to secure Russian cooperation on weapons disposal. The risk is negligible, the Administration says, but critics see a very high risk indeed. And some anti-nuclear activists were outraged, too, that that Mars-bound Russian spacecraft that fell to earth last week was carrying 200 grams of plutonium. There was no risk, officials said, but others asked, how could there not be?   CELEBRITY 'I'm Bob. Fly Me.' After years of toiling in near anonymity in Washington, a fellow named Bob Dole is starting to make a name for himself. He's appeared with David Letterman and on ''Saturday Night Live'' -- clearly, a man to watch. And last week he leapt even closer to the fickle, white-hot light of the big time, making his debut as a celebrity endorser. Under the line ''Not doing anything?'' in an Air France ad, there he is, smiling and waving -- the very image of a man with time on his hands. No, this doesn't mean he's cashing in on his fame as a politician; he's donating his fee to a center for the elderly. But who knows? Maybe soon he'll be enough of a celebrity that he could, say, run for President.  TOYS Mattel? Or Perhaps Mattel? If that toy you just tripped over wasn't made by Mattel, don't worry: it probably will be soon. Mattel, already the world's largest toy maker, agreed last week to buy Tyco, America's No. 3 toy company. But it's no doubt best to put that in terms that children will understand: one company will now turn out Barbie and Cabbage Patch dolls, Matchbox cars and Fisher-Price and Sesame Street products. There will be everything from the literary, like Scrabble, to the less intellectually taxing, like Baby Wiggles 'N Giggles. The giant new Mattel, a rival executive said, will now be able to tell retailers: ''I know this toy isn't selling, but you have to buy it anyway.''   GENERAL MOTORS So Where Are the Cars? Well, consumers seem ready to whirl General Motors back onto the dance floor, but the newer, prettier G.M. suddenly has a headache. After years of watching buyers turn to popular imports, G.M. finally has some models that people want -- like the Pontiac Grand Prix and some new mini-vans. But there is one tiny problem standing between the auto maker and its former glory: it can't build the cars fast enough. So the cruel twist now is that when buyers turn to imports, they might be settling for their second choice. G.M.'s excuse: it wants quality, not speed. But as G.M. goes, so goes the nation. Must be a parallel there. Life is great, and we can't get enough of it? Sounds good.  SAUDI ARABIA A Job? What's a Job? For a while there, it was often a nice soft life in those Arab countries that were drenched in oil money. In Saudi Arabia, say, sitting on a quarter of the world's oil reserves, natives got comfortable Government jobs and other handouts, and Indians or Pakistanis were brought in to do the messier work. But all soft things, alas, must come to an end. The oil's still there; the trouble is that the population's soaring, leaving economic growth in the dust. So this generation of Saudis are waking up to a harsh reality -- they must learn, as one Saudi official put it, ''to lower their noses'' and learn how to get jobs. One aspiring member of the work force referred to one possibility -- becoming a Mercedes salesman -- as a ''second-class job.'' What would he call selling Ford Escorts?  THE TREASURY The Check Is in the Air There's something deeply satisfying about getting a check from the Government, whether a tax refund or whatever, a sense that after all the income tax you feed to the Washington beast, here's a piece of paper showing that -- yes! -- it can flow the other way, too. But the Government, that perennial killjoy, wants to wrest this small pleasure from us. That beast, you see, makes 850 million payments a year. If by check, they cost 42 cents each; if by direct deposit, 2 cents. Small wonder that it's moving to force all recipients to take direct deposit, hoping to wipe out most checks by January 1999. It's a bit tough, though, on those who lack bank accounts. A possible solution is being tried in Texas: plastic cards are being issued to Social Security recipients, who can use them in stores and at A.T.M.'s. But there's a $3 monthly fee, plus any A.T.M. fees -- totaling a lot more than 42 cents.  TOBACCO WARS 'Smokeout' on TV For the annual Great American Smokeout on Thursday, HBO contributed ''Smoke Alarm,'' a half-hour show, mixing interviews and choking cartoon lungs, aimed at getting teen-agers not to smoke. The show featured a spoof of tobacco executives plotting how to hook ''pre-smokers'' (read ''teen-agers'') with cigarettes named for cartoon animals. ''Seinfeld'' also got into the act, as Kramer invited hordes of street smokers into his apartment, but was then horrified at how, within days, this intense exposure disfigured his face and teeth.  NEW YORK SCHOOLS The 42% Education The New York City school system is a big business, with an $8.2 billion annual budget, but it's a business under constant fire for the quality of its education. One question people have been asking for years is how much of that money goes to the system's equivalent of the factory floor: the classroom. And last week Chancellor Rudy Crew gave the answer: 42 percent. If that seems low, though, it is apparently in line with other large urban districts."

The scheduled privatization of 61 plants had prompted months of protests from oil workers and even many businessmen; the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party formally announced its opposition last month.

With its decision on the Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon was trying to encourage companies that do not rely so heavily on military contracts. News analysis. $(Page D2.$)    Support for Texaco Station Owners   Despite calls for a boycott, black motorists continued to patronize Texaco stations, with many saying that station owners should not be punished because of the comments of some corporate executives while discussing a bias suit brought against the company. $(B10.$)    Sudden Departure at Apple   When the executive in charge of Apple Computer's troubled operating systems division resigned, he raised new questions about the company's ability to solve its problems and differentiate its operating software from Microsoft's Windows 95. $(D9.$)    Dueling Standards for Cellular   Primeco Personal Communications has made good on its pledge to introduce its new type of wireless telephone service, known as P.C.S., last week in 15 metropolitan markets including Chicago and Miami.

Economists -- and, not surprisingly, the opposing camps in the campaign -- differ on whether this is the beginning of a longer downturn or a brief slowing of an expansion that can be sustained well into 1997. $(Page A1.$)    Treasury bond prices rose initially on the news of weakening growth, but fell back after a report of stronger-than-expected housing sales. The 30-year bond's yield edged up to 6.70 percent from 6.68 percent on Tuesday. $(D17.$)    Technology shares regained some ground, sending the Nasdaq up 3.18 points, to 1,206.23.

It said that it would sell four unprofitable units, including its structural steel mill, and that it would close the operations if no buyer was found. $(D2.$)    Fed Lowers Banking Barriers  The Fed voted to knock down some of the walls that separate banks from securities affiliates, allowing companies like J. P. Morgan and Bankers Trust greater freedom to market and develop investment products. $(D2.$)    Medicare Patients Win in Court  A Federal judge in Tucson, Ariz., expanded the rights of Medicare patients in H.M.O.'s, saying they are entitled to immediate hearings when they are denied medical services. $(B15.$)     A Well-Promoted Public Offering  The difference between a small company selling for pennies a share and one selling for $9 a share seems to be promotion -- at least in the case of a hot initial public offering for Chem International, a small maker of vitamins.
