Many readers demanded the return of the N.A.V. figure. In response to that demand, the Friday closing N.A.V. returns to the mutual fund tables this week. The percentage change continues to appear, making it easier to compare different funds. To the Editor:   Your new mutual fund historical performance data is interesting but of no value whatsover.

The decision, a difficult one for the P.L.O. chairman, who stood slumped over the podium with his arms folded, was made after the two sides failed to negotiate the boundaries of Palestinian self-rule in the town of Jericho and failed to determine who would control border crossings. They said that they had also been unable to agree on ""security arrangements"" for Jewish settlers living in the Gaza Strip."

He reveled in American-style politics -- from teleprompters to polo shirts to brisk tennis games -- and promised to end Japan's political corruption and economic collusion.   But after a blazing start, Mr. Hosokawa seems to be losing his magic touch. The programs on which he staked his leadership, reforming the political system and deregulating a languishing economy, have bogged down. Tokyo's back-room deal-making, which he denounced for years as Governor of a southern prefecture, is beginning to engulf him. Time and again in recent weeks he has struggled to keep ideological rifts between the Socialists and the seven other parties in his fragile coalition Cabinet from splitting the Government apart. So far it has held together, but at great political cost to Mr. Hosokawa.  Motivated by Bitterness    The bureaucrats who ran the country for four decades with the now-deposed Liberal Democratic Party snipe about the new Government's disorganization, whispering over lunch in Kasumigaseki, the Government center, that Mr. Hosokawa is proving himself a small-town politician. He is uninterested in foreign relations, they say, at sea when it comes to handling the economy, unwilling to delve into policy details. Editorialists have begun to complain that his Government is long on symbolism but short on action, too captivated by the example of another former Southern Governor across the Pacific."

Officially, the goal of the peace initiative sponsored by the European Community is still a Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina comprised of largely autonomous, largely ethnically uniform Muslim, Serbian and Croatian mini-republics. Such a preservation, at least on paper, of a single country would also preserve a supposedly sacrosanct international principle: that the borders of a state recognized by the United Nations cannot be altered by force."

The book includes blunt comments about his role in ordering the Tiananmen Square crackdown and his fear that democracy in China could ignite civil war.   The appearance of these valedictory writings at a time when the 89-year-old Mr. Deng's health is reported to be failing, together with the saturation coverage they are receiving in official news media, reflects what Western diplomats here say is the insecurity of Mr. Deng's successors over China's political stability after his death."

Converting a bedroom of his Los Angeles home into an office, Mr. Gray, 56, went to work for himself, recruiting inventors as his own clients.   He had tried to avoid self-employment. Most of his career had been spent as a physicist in the military industry, developing rockets and aircraft for General Electric, the Rand Corporation, TRW Inc. and the like. As those jobs disappeared, he took an 18-week course in patent law, passed a Federal exam and joined a law firm in 1991 as a patent agent. But 16 months later, the firm closed Mr. Gray's operation, and seeing no other choice, he became self-employed. Harder Than Old Jobs    For millions of people like Mr. Gray -- refugees from the corporate world -- self-employment, often as consultants, is turning out to be far harder work than their old jobs. Although many of them are well-educated, skilled and experienced, they have difficulty matching their old incomes when they go out on their own -- and their reduced buying power weakens the economy."

The new, united Germany is finding that the post-cold-war world is a more harshly competitive place than it was before.

He reveled in American-style politics -- from teleprompters to polo shirts to brisk tennis games -- and promised to end Japan's political corruption and economic collusion.   But after a blazing start, Mr. Hosokawa seems to be losing his magic touch. The programs on which he staked his leadership, reforming the political system and deregulating a languishing economy, have bogged down. Tokyo's back-room deal-making, which he denounced for years as Governor of a southern prefecture, is beginning to engulf him. Time and again in recent weeks he has struggled to keep ideological rifts between the Socialists and the seven other parties in his fragile coalition Cabinet from splitting the Government apart. So far it has held together, but at great political cost to Mr. Hosokawa.

Across Toplicin Venac square, beside children playing soccer in the dusk, hunks of pink meat lay on benches as people tried to arrange ways to bring them back to their homes."

Still, no one in the Japanese bureaucracy was quite prepared to deal with retailers like Ken Fujisawa, who had the temerity, in a family-owned store on a back street of Tokyo, to do what no one else had in a generation -- offer Japanese women a 20 percent discount on cosmetics made by the giant of the Japanese industry, Shiseido."

Mr. Clinton sent his assurances in a letter to the Syrian leader that was delivered today by Ambassador Christopher Ross to Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa. The letter was prompted in part by Mr. Clinton's meeting at the White House on Friday with Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, Administration officials said."

Despite declining in three of the last four months, orders for machine tools so far this year are still nearly 30 percent ahead of a year earlier. Because of exceptionally larger orders from automobile makers in March through June, Albert Moore, president of the trade group said, ""this year is almost sure to be the best since 1988.""  Searching for Clues    Although the $258.5 million of new orders for machine tools in October is less than two-tenths of one percent of the $135.8 billion of new orders for durable goods that month, the tool-making industry is watched for clues to the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy.

(The first two have survived to our time.)  What we do for a living identifies -- and labels -- us as surely as a leap of leopards and a parliament of owls capture the essences of those groups forever. So, in the spirit of the 14th century, I have coined some collective terms designed to illuminate, glorify or skewer the professions and occupations of the modern world."

Answer: The huge numbers of new fund investors plus the fact that the stock market has largely been very favorable since the 1987 market crash have caused concern. Some people theorize that mass redemptions by investors at the first sign of a serious market drop would fuel a decline by forcing fund managers to sell into a down market.   But a recent random survey of 501 United States stock-fund investors, commissioned by Neuberger & Berman Management Inc. in New York, found that more shareowners said they would buy shares in a declining market than would sell. In a market decline of 10 percent, 20 percent of investors said they would buy and 5 percent said they would sell; in a 20 percent decline, 20 percent said they would buy and 8 percent sell, and in a market drop of 40-plus percent, 21 percent said they would buy compared with 11 percent who would sell."

Yeltsin, Nikolai Medvedev, was quoted by Interfax as saying about the ultranationalist party of Mr. Zhirinovsky, which won a stunning 24 percent in the party-preference voting for the new Parliament. The party-preference vote is used to apportion half of the 450 seats in Parliament; the other half are filled in the district elections."

""I'M NOT in the cable business,"" insists Glenn R. Jones, chairman and chief executive of Jones Intercable Inc., Jones Spacelink Ltd., Jones International Ltd. and Mind Extension University. ""I'm in the business of extending the human mind.""   Certainly, Mr. Jones, 63, is not your everyday cable executive. The owner of 23-year-old Jones Intercable, the country's seventh-largest cable operator, which owns or manages 44 cable systems serving 1.4 million subscribers in California, New York and 18 other states, sees himself as a visionary pioneer on the information highway, an entrepreneur/ risk-taker, a poet of technology. He works from a high-tech headquarters in Denver. And he reads voraciously, cites science fiction easily and writes books and poetry (as Yankee Jones).   Like Ted Turner, Mr. Jones is also producing his own programming. In 1989, he founded the Jones Entertainment Group, which produced the current release ""Household Saints."" And like other cable moguls, Mr. Jones has recently seen his wealth ballooning -- Intercable's shares are up nearly 70 percent since May, trading at around $17 last week -- as Wall Street has become bullish on cable's role in the future delivery of home entertainment. Witness Bell Atlantic's deal for Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, and the battle between Viacom and QVC Network for Paramount Communications. Indeed, Intercable and Spacelink themselves may merge to help attract a partnership deal or capital from Pacific Telesis or Bell Canada.   ""The entertainment business,"" Mr. Jones says, ""impacts the human mind, which is the determination point of the electronic highway. The brain is a three-pound electrochemical device that cooks along at about 25 watts, mostly glucose. It's really the world's first computer.""   Mr. Jones's mix of management philosophy and technological jargon suggests a cross between Carl Sagan and Ross Perot. To keep up with the latest ideas, Mr. Jones often buys $500 worth of books at a time and stuffs them into three backpacks, keeping one in the office, one on his five-seater jet and one in the trunk of his white Mercedes. At his Frank Lloyd Wright-style home in Denver, he just finished reading a biography of Jefferson and has started one on John Paul Jones.   ""Those people,"" he said, ""talked about the idea of individual freedom and the concept of self-government -- a delicate, tenuous experiment still going on because it was based on having an informed electorate, which brings you right into education. Our democracy needs to become more electronic.""   The education of America is Mr. Jones's passion. He has lavished some $30 million on his Mind Extension University since he founded it in 1987 to provide college classes -- with credit -- by cable. This type of education, he said, would not have worked before the advent of the VCR, with its taping capabilities.   Right now, 25.5 million subscribers to basic cable systems that carry the MEU channel can watch classes for free, but those seeking credit must enroll at one of the 26 universities. The schools, which charge MEU students less than the full cost of actually attending class, include the University of California at Berkeley, George Washington University, the University of Maryland and Colorado State. Currently, Mr. Jones said, 36,000 students are enrolled in at least one course.   Linda Roberts, special adviser on technology for the United States Education Department, gives Mr. Jones credit for being on the cutting edge of the information highway. ""Mind Extension University is a very important example of how we can use today's technological systems, whether cable or interactive fiber,"" she said.   While he is proud of his educational mission, Mr. Jones is a bit defensive about MEU's for-profit status as well as its current lack of profits. ""It is a legitimate purpose of the private sector to focus upon and help resolve the intractable problems of our culture,"" he insisted. He added: ""I'm taking the risks. And it's un-American for me not to make a profit somewhere down the line -- about three years.""   Mr. Jones is used to being called crazy -- like a fox.   ""We started small when people didn't understand the limited partnership concept"" in acquiring cable systems, he said, ""so we had to form our own securities company. We raised $152,000 with the first limited partnership, then started raising $33 million and $55 million at a clip. It was un-American at the time, but it became mainstream when I raised $200 million. Since 1972, we've raised $1.3 billion in capital. We have 170,000 limited partners.""   In many ways, Mr. Jones is already living the future. Of the company's 3,600 employees in the Denver area, 350 work in the suburb of Englewood in a glass office building with a helicopter pad. Fiber-optic and coaxial cables snake under the floors. Mr. Jones's circular office has 16 television sets and a computer that can manipulate several satellite dishes. At the center of the building is an atrium, featuring a big reflecting pool with an island.   In a ceremony in the atrium each year, Mr. Jones honors one of his employees for a job well done. The employee receives the award on the island as colleagues watch and bagpipes play.   ""There's a lot of poetry in business,"" Mr. Jones said. ""Hard as it is."""

Now, a couple of heavyweight academics, George Ackerlof and Paul Romer of the University of California at Berkeley, have come around to the popular view. Indeed, in an article to be published later this month in the Brookings Institution's Papers on Economic Activity, they go much further, blaming the perpetrators of the savings and loan scam for the junk bond and corporate takeover excesses of the decade.    Where the truth lies is still unclear. What is clear, though, is that the Ackerlof-Romer ""looting"" hypothesis will raise the dander of economists who are convinced that the financial scandal had much more to do with perverse Government incentives than outright villainy."

Are flight attendants still getting the shaft a decade after they made concessions, including allowing the company to impose its two-tier wage system, to save their jobs and, supposedly, the airline? Or is American a benevolent employer, simply seeking flexibility to allow it to compete in what every American man, woman, child and kitty cat by now agrees is a killer industry?"

Heeeere's Ross! It's the Nafta Follies!  It was the television equivalent of historical fiction. The subject was serious, but it had ""entertainment"" written all over it. As entertainment it scored: Last week's Gore-Perot ""chart wars"" (as a White House aide labeled it) drew the largest audience ever for a scheduled cable program. The subject was the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Ross Perot has gleefully blasted, but kernels of serious debate were hard to spot amid the charts, pictures and what were generously called facts. After the dust cleared, the battle raged hotter than ever for lawmakers' hearts as this week's House vote neared.  Many Mexicans did not take kindly to Mr. Perot's depiction of a destitute country almost totally lacking in customers with enough money to buy American products. ""Before he opens his mouth,"" a Mexico City lawyer said, ""he ought to come down here and take a look."" And one newspaper termed Mr. Perot's comments a ""series of calumnies and lies.""  Getting, Spending: A Balancing Act  Lawmakers, by and large, decide how this nation gets and spends. If getting doesn't keep up with spending, it's clear where to point fingers. But many lawmakers are saying, in effect, ""We can't do it, so make us do it."" That's what a balanced-budget amendment comes down to. The idea creates some odd Senate bedfellows -- Paul Simon, liberal stalwart, who favors more getting (taxes), and Orrin Hatch, conservative extraordinaire, who advocates less spending. Cries are getting louder for a vote, but last week, bowing to Thanksgiving, its backers put it off till February.  A Pass Is Just a Pass? No Way! The debate heats up daily: Where, in that vast gray area between leer and lunge, does sexual harassment lie? Several Federal courts have ruled that lawsuits should show workplace harassment so bad that it caused ""severe psychological injury."" Or, in effect, someone can shoot at you as long as you don't get hit. But last week the Supreme Court stepped in and stretched the definition considerably, ruling that harassment that creates a ""hostile and abusive"" environment is illegal. ""The time for strained legal arguments is over,"" said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center. Inflation: It's Gone! It's Back!  Inflation was pronounced dead on Tuesday, but some people swore they saw it wink on Wednesday. First came a report that producer prices, having trended downward most of the year, fell another 0.2 percent in October. That provided reassurance that inflation had been tamed, and interest rates retreated. But then came news that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, the most in six months. The main culprit was a higher gas tax, clearly a one-time blip, but rates headed up again.  And the economy is stronger, as the numbers keep showing. On Friday came a report that October's retail sales had risen 1.5 percent, the biggest gain in six months. Slowing Down 10-Ton Speeders  Speeding is a big killer on our highways, but it's all relative. A sports car tooling along at 80 is far less lethal than a 10-ton truck. So last week the Transportation Department proposed a ban on radar detectors in trucks over 18,000 pounds. Independent truckers don't like it -- any more than they like the higher diesel prices that spurred last week's protests -- but most other people do, so it will probably happen. Looking Joblessness in the Face  Strong as some economic statistics are, they don't help those who are left behind as this nation goes through wrenching changes and dislocations. And their pain could be seen vividly last week on the streets of Detroit, a city that has had its insides torn out by the icy streamlining of the auto industry. Detroit's jobless -- the city's unemployment rate is 13 percent, twice the national rate -- are so hungry for decent work that thousands of them lined up in the cold dawn for jobs that may never exist. The very iffy jobs were advertised by sponsors of a casino in downtown Detroit to be owned by an Indian tribe in northern Michigan. The casino has slim chances of being approved, underscoring the job-seekers' desperation. But as one applicant said, ""There's nothing else happening but crime."" COMPANIES A Drug Maker Goes to the People  Makers of prescription drugs have long stayed above the consumer fray, their prices untouched by the messiness of the marketplace. But pressures have mounted from all sides, whether it's Hillary Rodham Clinton scolding them for high prices or upstart generics turning the competitive screws. So, as in so much of the health care universe, times are changing. Last week, in a vivid demonstration of this shift, SmithKline Beecham said it would give $10 rebates for a month's supply of Tagamet, its big-selling ulcer drug. The company's patent on Tagamet runs out in May, and a generic version is on the way, so this could be a signal that name brands will try harder to hang onto their market. Instant Rival for Cellular Phones  Wireless communications: two words that define a big slice of our future. But in the flick of an antenna, that future can take on a far different shape, as was proved last week when a relatively obscure company called Nextel Communications agreed to buy a bunch of mobile-radio licenses from Motorola for $1.8 billion in stock. Suddenly everyone looked at the numbers and realized that with the theoretical ability to serve 180 million people nationwide, Nextel had vaulted itself into a force that has to be taken very, very seriously by cellular phone companies. And Nextel, whose shares have quadrupled in a year, has an edge: In addition to voice conversations, it can offer built-in paging and data communications, which most cellular services don't offer. It faces a long, bumpy ride, though; the cellular industry has a huge head start. Going Hog-Wild Over a Chicken  Some elf clearly went around Wall Street whispering ""rotisserie chicken"" in eager ears, because last week a lot of investors decided that was the place to put their money. When Boston Chicken, a franchiser, made an initial offering at $20 a share, so many investors scrambled for feathers that when trading opened, the shares more than doubled, ending at $48.50. The shares passed through a lot of hands that day: The offering had just over 2 million shares, but volume was 8.4 million. Investors' ardor cooled by Friday, and the stock slid to $39.75. Paramount Does Its Own Buying  Bored with would-be buyers hammering on its door, Paramount made its own big-money acquisition last week. Paramount, which owns Simon & Schuster, agreed to pay $553 million for Macmillan, to create the world's No. 2 book publisher, after Bertelsmann. And whether it's method or madness, this adds a wrinkle to the Paramount war. The book deal is so big it already raises antitrust flags, but if QVC wins Paramount, the antitrust issue gets even thornier: Advance Publications, owner of Random House, is backing QVC. And let's not forget the latest bulletin on Paramount's dance card: BellSouth has agreed to slip $1.5 billion into QVC's pocket as QVC courts the popular studio. INTERNATIONAL Haiti's Children Pay the Price  When Americans hear of the oil embargo and other sanctions against Haiti, their mental image may well be of Haiti's military rulers holed up in a bunker, isolated by rising international pressure. The reality might be far more cruel. Harvard public health experts said in a study last week that the sanctions are killing as many as 1,000 Haitian children each month. As another, less painful tack, the Administration is trying to get other nations' support for freezing overseas assets of Haiti's leaders. Starving children might prefer that. Disney's French Albatross  The Walt Disney Company is probably wishing it had never tried to translate its magic formula into French. Disney is taking in plenty of money back home, but Euro Disney, clearly the victim of a sorcerer's curse, just drains away the profits. Last week, in fact, Euro Disney -- 49 percent-owned by Disney -- reported a $900 million yearly loss, dragging Disney itself into a quarterly deficit. If it doesn't get fresh cash, Euro Disney said it would face a ""liquidity problem"" (that's American for ""no money""). While banks might fear throwing good money after bad, Disney has too much at stake to walk away. Can Japan's Doors Be Opened?  Japan's economy has long been a prime American target. The goods flow out, we say, but tight regulations keep them from flowing in, giving a nasty tilt to the trade balance. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, three months in office, is determined to hack away at that regulatory wall. Last week a panel he appointed called for easing or ending hundreds of regulations, and even, in a nation built on monopolies, advocated strict application of anti-monopoly laws. So Mr. Hosokawa now has a snazzy bouquet to offer President Clinton when they meet in Seattle this week. But it remains to be seen whether he'll really be able to nudge Japan toward freer markets."

At the opening of a meeting of the agency's board of governors in Vienna, Hans Blix, the agency's director general, stopped just short of saying that the inspection process had totally broken down because of the North's refusal to allow regular inspections. But his aides made it clear that he was ready to make such a declaration by the end of the month, a step that officials in Washington and Seoul have said would mean sanctions."

Over the years it has lost tens of thousands of jobs to foreign countries where lower wages and business costs seem the perfect setting for churning out competitively priced shirts, jackets, pants and blouses.   But the industry is split over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Some prominent New York manufacturers support it and are convinced that they have little to fear from Mexico's lower-wage work force. In fact, they think New York's battered economy may actually benefit if Congress approves the trade pact, which will reduce tariffs among the United States, Mexico and Canada. However, other manufacturers -- and the industry's unions -- believe that the prospect of increased Mexican competition is unfair and may ultimately mean their demise."

Perhaps the only way The New York Post could survive was without the Newspaper Guild. Not even Rupert Murdoch is willing to put up with $14 million-a-year losses in exchange for the joys of blaring sensational headlines at New Yorkers, and the job security demanded by the guild just didn't work with the new Murdoch math. Nine craft unions came to terms with Mr. Murdoch in recent months, and their pacts are now in force. But last week, with the guild broken and The Post in Mr. Murdoch's pocket, humbled guild members, hats and blue pencils in hand, had to reapply for their old jobs as The Post sought ""the best and most aggressive"" workers. True, since many of the 287 guild members will not get those jobs, the glass is half empty. But Mr. Murdoch seemed fully prepared to drop the glass on the floor.

The next Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, has said he wants to renegotiate the agreement to protect some Canadian exporters.   The possible objections from Canada provide an opportunity to ask what will happen in the bond market if the United States Congress rejects the agreement with Mexico. A leading opponent of the agreement, David E. Bonior, a Democrat of Michigan, said yesterday that just 10 more votes were needed to get the 218 votes to defeat the trade pact. Congress is scheduled to vote on it on Nov. 17."

The F.D.I.C. is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from the professional advisers to failed savings and loan associations, and two important Federal appeals courts have split over whether the legal theory behind these lawsuits is valid."

Three quarters of chief executives are looking for new jobs, half have received offers in the last year and, in general, everyone would rather be working less and playing more. According to one of the survey's sponsors, the results indicate not so much that senior people are actually moving but that they are positioning themselves to make lemonade out of the lemons that pass as opportunities in corporate life today."
