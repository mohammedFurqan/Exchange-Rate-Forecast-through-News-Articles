""The AIDS and HIV epidemic has had an impact with the aid of the tabloids, which label it the gay plague. In the last 20 years, lesbian and gay politics have progressed dramatically in this country, but the police attitude reflects a 60's approach to a 90's problem. They still project us as a homosexual underworld, with various vices, who need to be controlled. That is absolute baloney.""   Mr. Woods and other campaigners said that the national detection rate for murders of homosexuals is roughly 55 percent, while that for all murders is 80 to 90 percent. They also said that more than 5,000 gay men were arrested in Britain last year for sexual offenses such as public indecency and importuning. Of those, 1,000 were arrested in London, they said, representing a 350 percent increase. The Gay London Policing Group, which collates data, estimates that there are more than 1,000 attacks against homosexuals in London each year but says that most victims do not report the crimes because they fear the incidents will be trivialized or that they themselves will come under investigation.   ""We are pushing for the police to start monitoring and recording such assaults as anti-gay,"" said Paul Burston, of the Gay London Policing Group. ""But they refuse, saying it would be an administrative nightmare and not practicable. They said the same thing to the black community years ago, and are now monitoring attacks against them as racially motivated.""   A spokesman for Scotland Yard said that all murders, whatever the sexual orientation of the victim, were thoroughly investigated. He said that solving murders involving homosexuals could be hampered because they were more likely to meet strangers. Of the 176 murders committed in Britain in 1989, the spokesman said, 145 were solved.   The spokesman ruled out monitoring attacks, saying that ethnicity was easier to determine than sexual orientation and that it was offensive to question victims about their sexual behavior unless it was vital to an investigation.   Advocates say that British homosexuals are far less politicized than those in the United States, and that a gay protest that attracts half a million people in New York City draws 30,000 in London.   ""The level of intolerance is probably the same here as in the United States, but our ability to deal with it is much less,"" Mr. Woods said. ""Lesbians and gay men in this country have far less political power than in the United States.   ""But things are changing, and people are moving into a more offensive position,"" he said. ""We are saying that this is a blunt question of civil liberties, that gay men and lesbians are being denied fundamental human rights."""
