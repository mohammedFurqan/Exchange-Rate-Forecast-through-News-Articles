It displays black and white images on a screen that measures two inches diagonally. The Sinclair unit, on the other hand, weighs less than a pound, measures only one inch thick and has a three-inch (diagonal) screen. Both sets will receive VHF and UHF channels."

Although note and bond prices have increased and yields have fallen in a week of heavy Treasury financing, many dealers said the outlook for lower interest rates was not as one-sided as recent trading would indicate.   Among the uncertainties facing dealers and investors are the size of future Treasury borrowings, Federal Reserve monetary policy and the impact of the Falkland Islands dispute on large United States banks with loans to Argentina.   ''The market is probably split 50-50 between the bulls and the bears,'' said Edwin Kantor, a senior vice president at Drexel Burnham. ''There is steady underlying demand from investors who want to lock in these yields,'' he said, ''but they are cautious enough to keep some money in reserve so that they can follow the market whichever way it goes.''"

Unlike the stock-index futures, which were widely backed by the industry, these options, as they are now proposed, are provoking quiet but fierce opposition from some leaders in the industry.   One of these opponents is George D.F. Lamborn, who supports the concept of exchange-traded options in general. Mr. Lamborn is a cochairman of Refco International Futures Inc., chairman of the clearing association of the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and a member of other exchanges that plan to introduce exchange-traded commodity options in the next few months.   ''Despite the well-intentioned and costly efforts of exchanges and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the proposed options will not protect the public,'' he said ''Rather, what is inadvertently being designed is a carefully fashioned booby trap for investors, exchange floor traders, brokers and, indeed, the entire commodities industry.''"

Industry analysts said that a high-level committee established by Congress to do away with the ceilings on bank interest rates is likely to approve a short-term certificate with a minimum deposit somewhere between $10,000 and $25,000. The committee also would decide whether the interest rate would be tied to a short-term Treasury bill rate or whether institutions would be allowed to determine their own rates without restrictions."

Pollution control technology is bound to become a major issue in the debate.   In general, industry groups want to water down environmental laws and regulations. Many argue that at least some of the reductions in discharges that the regulations require are not worth the capital and operating costs. Others say that the time limits imposed by the existing laws are impossible to meet. And most of the industry groups say that there are a number of ways to achieve the desired overall improvements more economically; for instance, a company that would have to spend heavily to reduce discharges might locate a neighbor (already in compliance) that could achieve a comparable reduction at far less cost, and pay the neighbor to do it."

The purpose is to improve the bank's profitability, which Mr.  Cooley said is far more important than size.  In 1981, Wells Fargo earned 52 cents on each $100 of its average total assets, a key indicator of a bank's basic profitability. This made Wells the eighth most profitable among the nation's fifteen largest bank holding companies.

The move is expected to put additional economic and political pressures on the Argentine Government, which is short of foreign exchange needed to finance its military operations in the Falkland Islands.   The Soviet Union is Argentina's major trading partner, buying about three fourths of its 20 million-ton annual grain crop.  About 7 million tons of grain from this year's harvest with an estimated value of $800 million remain to be sold. The Soviet Union was expected to take about three fourths of that amount, mostly corn, sorghum and soy, in the next few months."

Armed with capital from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which now has a 51 percent interest in the New York bank, Marine is aggressively seeking to buy banks around the United States. Hongkong and Shanghai, one of the most powerful banks in Asia, operates more than 400 offices in 40 countries and is especially strong in the Far East, the Middle East and India.   Because Federal law prohibits interstate banking, Marine's purchases cannot be consummated until the law changes, but the bank is confident that the change will come in the not-too-distant future. Until then, it is holding options to trade nonvoting preferred stock that it now owns in the out-of-state banks for common voting stock.  If the acquisitions do not go through, the preferred stock can be redeemed over a 20-year period."

Following are excerpts from the section on domestic monetary arrangements, and comments by commission members.  WE considered a number of alternatives that would serve to reintroduce gold into our domestic monetary policy arrangements. The objective would be to improve monetary control through the discipline of gold for the purpose of reducing inflation. Linking changes in the growth rate of money or of some component of money, such as Federal Reserve notes, or of bank reserves, to the change in the gold stock is one approach which was considered for imposing the discipline of gold.   One way to reintroduce gold would be to require the Federal Reserve System to maintain a minimum ratio between the Government's gold stock and the Federal Reserve monetary base (i.e., Federal Reserve notes plus bank reserves) or some monetary aggregate. A variant would fix upper and lower limits to the ratio, so that the System would be required to take expansionary actions when the ratio was at its lower limit. The gold cover requirement might be valued at the price of $42.22, or adjusted gradually, or allowed to fluctuate with market prices."

''Now they've gone after the Syrian missile sites and they've seem to gone beyond just going after the Palestinians.''   Mr. Zablocki's statement came as questions arose in Congress and within the Reagan Administration about Israel's use of American arms in the invasion of Lebanon. The United States has traditionally supplied arms to Israel on the agreement that the weaponry would be used only for defense."

Today, the industry has grown huge, and the emphasis is on investment as much as write-off.   Robert A. Stanger, who publishes the Stanger Report on tax shelter investing in Fair Haven, N.J., estimates that sales last year, including public and private placements, reached $8 billion.   There are still shady deals around, but an emphasis on investment merit comes from the new tax law, which reduced tax brackets and cut the top Federal rate to 50 percent from 70 percent, curbing the appetite for large upfront deductions. It also gave the Internal Revenue Service more muscle by increasing penalties for underpayment of taxes and overvaluing assets for depreciation purposes."

In a clean sweep, the opposition - the Mauritian Militant Movement and its smaller ally, the Mauritian Social Democratic Party - won election of all their candidates in the 60 constituencies. The only two members of the new Parliament not belonging to the victorious alliance are representatives of a local party on Rodrigues, an island dependency 250 miles to the east, where the victors ran no candidates.   The vote was a repudiation of the Labor Party and its leader, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the 82-year-old Prime Minister, and brought to power a party that was pledged to limited nationalization under a program of ''Socialism with a Mauritian face.'' It has also promised to be nonaligned and to campaign in international forums such as the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations against the American military presence on the island of Diego Garcia, 1,250 miles away."

A Presidential statement released by the White House this afternoon attributed the decision to Mr. Reagan's desire ''to advance reconciliation in Poland'' by continuing economic pressure on the Soviet Union and Poland.   Since the imposition of martial law, the statement read, ''little has changed concerning the situation in Poland; there has been no movement that would enable us to undertake positive reciprocal measures.''   The pipeline sanctions were first imposed last Dec. 30 solely on American companies in response to the imposition of martial law in Poland in mid-December. Their practical effect was to bar the General Electric Company, the Caterpillar Tractor Company and other major United States companies from selling equipment for the construction of a 3,700-mile pipeline from Siberia to West Germany that eventually might supply Germany, France, Italy and Spain with more than 30 percent of their natural gas."

For 37 years mankind has had to live with the terrible burden of nuclear weapons. From the dawn of the nuclear age, these weapons have been the source of grave concern to our peoples and the focus of continuous public debate. Every successive President of the United States has shared these concerns.  Every administration has had to engage itself in this debate.   It is right that each succeeding generation should question anew the manner in which its leaders exercise such awesome responsibilities. It is right that each new administration should have to confront the aweful dilemmas posed by the possession of nuclear weapons. It is right that our nuclear strategy should be exposed to continuous examination.   In debating these issues, we should not allow the complexity of the problems and the gravity of the stakes to blind us to the common ground upon which we all stand. No one has ever advocated nuclear war. No responsible voice has ever sought to minimize its horrors."

They were long strategically important as the nearest refuge for ships from the dangerous passage around Cape Horn. Their territorial waters are now considered a likely source of oil and gas.   Britain's claim to the Falklands, one of its last colonial possessions, is based on their probable discovery in 1592 by John Davis. The islands have also been claimed and occupied at various times by Spain, France and Argentina. The Argentine claim stems mainly from rights inherited from Spain, which recorded a discovery in 1520 by members of Ferdinand Magellan's round-the-world expedition. The islands were named in 1690 for Viscount Falkland, treasurer of the British Navy. In 1832, a colony of Argentines seized several United States sealing ships, which led to a United States punitive expedition that forced many colonists out. In 1832-33, a British expedition removed the last Argentines and founded a permanent colony of settlers. Many of their descendants still live there and have repeatedly affirmed their intention to remain British."

Total sales last year barely exceeded $1 million, and it spent only $1.2 million on research and development.   But this nondescript, five-year-old company, which makes paper copiers and cassette tape-copying machines in a cramped factory outside of Chicago, has beaten the world leaders in the paper copier business - Xerox, Olympia, Minolta, Sharp - to a lucrative 20-year contract with China.   ''I never even heard of the company before this,'' said Eugene G.  Glazer, a stock analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''Now they're the talk of the town. This contract may not put them on the Fortune 500 list, but it's an awful lot of business.'' Indeed, the deal with China could bring Clark Copy $65 million in sales during the contract's life."

British analysts believe that Syrian will react immediately if the Israeli tanks that are now thrust into Lebanon should veer toward the Bekkaa Valley. Since the end of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the Syrian high command has considered that valley the sector most dangerous in the event of war with Israel. Its possession would enable an Israeli force to bypass the main Syrian defenses and push north into central Syria."

But it is generally agreed that it is going to be very hard to translate the proposal into an agreement.   Any proposal to curb nuclear arms would run into formidable problems at this stage. The starting point is the fact that Soviet and American strengths and weaknesses are almost mirror images of each other. Thus, the United States would try to curtail Soviet advantages in land-based missiles, and the Soviet Union would seek to thwart American leads in submarines that fire ballistic missiles, the submarine-launched missiles themselves, long-range bombers and cruise missiles."

Kennan, Robert S. McNamara and Gerard Smith:   For 33 years now, the Atlantic alliance has relied on the asserted readiness of the United States to use nuclear weapons if necessary to repel aggression from the East. Initially, indeed, it was widely thought (notably by such great and different men as Winston Churchill and Niels Bohr) that the basic military balance in Europe was between American atomic bombs and the massive conventional forces of the Soviet Union. But the first Soviet explosion, in August 1949, ended the American monopoly only one month after the Senate approved the North Atlantic Treaty, and in 1950 Communist aggression in Korea produced new allied attention to the defense of Europe."

She says Vietnam is worse off now medically and nutritionally than it was two years ago, when rice harvests were poorer than last year's.   The reasons for such difficulties, she says, have at least as much to do with mismanagement, rigid doctrine, disastrous planning and Communist hostility to bourgeois technicians, administrators, farmers and others as they have to do with decades of destructive war.   Politically and economically, she said in an interview earlier this month, Vietnam is ''feudal'' - ''a gerontocracy'' and ''a failure.''

I deeply respect the reasons which led you to send your message and should like to reply in the same spirit of frankness and candor.   The conflict was not of our making. It was the Argentine forces who invaded the islands and broke the peace. We have striven for seven weeks to secure a negotiated settlement but Argentina has shown no disposition to match our endeavors in good faith. A cease-fire has to be accompanied by withdrawal of Argentine troops. To do otherwise would leave the aggressor in occupation and in possession of the rewards of military adventure."

The Canadian Petroleum Association, the umbrella trade group for the major domestic and foreign companies operating in Canada, said the policy had reduced the industry's cash flow by 30 percent, ''in turn, drastically limiting the ability of oil companies to finance the activities which, over the long term, would make the nation selfsufficient and secure.''   The association delivered its attack today in full-page newspaper advertisements, before a committee of the House of Commons and finally at a news conference.

Three weeks after Queen Elizabeth II proclaimed the Constitution in Ottawa, Premier Rene Levesque's government introduced a bill in the National Assembly that uses one section of the basic law to nullify others that deal with rights and freedoms. And with the bill's expected passage before summer, Quebecers will not live under the same bill of rights as other Canadians.   Mr. Levesque thus sought to make good his vow to reject a Constitution that he feels infringes on the powers of the Quebec Assembly and to make its application in the largely French-speaking province as difficult and complicated as possible. Alone among the 10 provinces, Quebec refused to sign an agreement reached last November between Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the nine premiers of English-speaking Canada that finally led to the country's constitutional independence from Britain."

The Pravda article reiterated Soviet charges that Israel's objectives in the invasion were to destroy the Palestinian Liberation Organization, to establish a pliant government in Lebanon and to weaken Syria so that it, too, would fall in line with what Pravda called the ''second stage'' of the Camp David agreement signed in 1978 by Israel, Egypt and the United States.   The Soviet paper said that the Camp David idea was ''to beat the Arabs, one by one,'' beginning with Egypt.

''This is the time for advocates of a simpler and fairer tax system - and I consider myself one of them - to come forward and take the first steps that are needed,'' the Kansas Republican said in a prepared statement he read to the committee.   He reaffirmed an earlier promise that the committee would hold hearings this year on proposals for a ''flat,'' or single-rate, income tax. 'Dramatic Demonstration'   Indicating that he thought tax simplification combined with rate reduction could be politically rewarding, Senator Dole referred to the statement of support for such tax revision adopted by the Democratic conference in Philadelphia. ''Over the weekend, we saw a dramatic demonstration of the growing support for a lower-rate, much simpler income tax,'' he said."

In general, there is a widespread and somber feeling here that by moving its forces into Lebanon, Israel was contemptuously taking the peace offered by Egypt for granted and thus exposing this country's impotence and isolation. At the same time, editorials in the press here, the terse statements of the nation's leaders and the inert placidity of street life seemed to reaffirm that Egypt has very little leverage over Israel.   The official condemnation of the Israeli onslaught has been impassioned and clear. Yet there has been no serious attempt on the part of any public official to urge a retreat from the process of normalizing relations with Israel that was set in motion by the Camp David accords."

Their oversized screens proliferated through the 1950's and flourished in the 1960's, when Americans in love with their cars drove them just about any place four wheels would go.   By the 1970's, however, drive-ins had begun to go the way of cheap gasoline and big cars. And last year, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, only 3,354 drive-in screens still operated in the United States - down 11 percent from a decade before and more than 17 percent from the 1958 peak of 4,063.

That was about five years and $315 million ago, when the international diamond cartel that De Beers manages could not acquire enough gemstones to meet the demand made on its London-based Central Selling Organization.   Now the pendulum has swung, with the result that De Beers, which markets 85 percent of the world's diamonds, has cut its supposedly sacrosanct dividend for the first time in more than a generation and the cartel has all but suspended purchases of the more expensive stones. Diamond Market in Slump   The diamond trade has been in a slump since the spring of 1980 when many investors began taking advantage of high interest rates and consumers started buying fewer, and smaller, diamonds."

Willy Brandt, the party chairman, said the losses suffered in Hamburg by both the Social Democrats and their coalition partners, the Free Democrats were ''a serious setback'' that made the business of governing together ''very much more difficult.''   The results meant that for the first time since World War II, the opposition Christian Democrats had outpolled the Social Democratic Party in Hamburg, a bastion to which Mr. Brandt's party had always laid claim.   It signified as well a reversal in traditional roles between the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. The opposition party has become the leading vote-getter in every major city -Hamburg, West Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich - all places where the Social Democrats, who describe themselves as representing working people, were once dominant."

The results have been a treaty to limit defensive nuclear systems, signed in 1972 and ratified by the Senate; an interim agreement on limiting some long-range offensive nuclear weapons, signed at the same time and endorsed by both houses of Congress, and an unratified treaty on offensive nuclear arms completed in 1979.   Last Nov. 30 the two countries began talks in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear weapons. These talks are now in recess.  President Reagan has proposed what he calls the ''zero option.'' Under this the United States would cancel plans to deploy 572 new medium-range weapons in Western Europe - 464 cruise missiles and 108 Pershing 2's -in exchange for an agreement by the Soviet Union to dismantle 600 SS-20, SS-4 and SS-5 missiles already stationed in the European part of its territory."

Bressler starred first as a financial specialist and then took the reins as a division head and a corporate planner before reaching the top.   That training, in three companies, is now being put to the test.  Nearly two years ago, Mr. Bressler moved from a high-level oil industry job to head Burlington Northern Inc., a 29-state railroad that for years had been plagued by an awkward management structure that resulted in lagging profits and a failure to take advantage of the company's natural resources.   By introducing new financial goals, filling some key positions with outsiders and focusing more on natural resources, Mr. Bressler has eased some problems and moved Burlington onto a markedly different track.   Following a billion-dollar spending program undertaken by his predecessors to cash in on the Western coal-hauling boom, the 51-year-old chairman and chief executive officer dropped 660 miles of idle rural track, along with outmoded depots and maintenance yards."

In 1979, the Dayco Corporation had record sales of $740 million, stood among the largest 400 industrial companies and was offered a chance to break into a vast new market: the Soviet Union.   With Dayco's domestic sales down because of a slump in the automotive industry, and profits sliding, the company welcomed the $117 million worth of Soviet orders for belts and hoses that were placed by a New York sales agent.   Dayco cranked up its plants and, in an unusual move, prepaid $13 million in commissions to its sales agent. But the Soviet deal turned sour. Early this year, Dayco announced that most of the orders had turned out to be ''entirely fictitious,'' took an after-tax write-off of $11.7 million and recorded a loss for its fiscal year ended last Oct. 31."

Mr. Haig said that pressing regional issues such as the Lebanon crisis would be discussed at today's session beginning at 9:30 A.M.   Several hours before his meeting with Mr. Gromyko, Mr. Haig had breakfast with Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel to discuss the intensive diplomatic efforts now going on to produce a lasting cease-fire in Lebanon.

The company is the BOC Group, formerly the British Oxygen Corporation, and its managing director and chief executive is 48-year-old Richard Vincent Giordano.   ''There's nothing so special about us,'' insisted Mr. Giordano, a Harvard College and Columbia Law School graduate. Perhaps, but despite a sagging British economy and $30.6 million in payments to laid-off workers last year, BOC's after-tax profits jumped 27 percent, to $166.3 million, in 1981 on sales of $2.7 billion. The price of BOC stock more than doubled, to $2.81, since the former Wall Street lawyer took over in late 1979, and further brisk growth is predicted. Indeed, profits jumped 34 percent in the first quarter of this year, to $39.4 million."

The two were the first of the big oil companies to report results for the period.   Officials at Indiana Standard said the increase resulted largely from higher earnings in domestic refining and marketing tied to lower crude oil costs.

Add to that a clannish atmosphere in which most executives have at one time worked with one another, a lack of public scrutiny until recent years and an endlessly migrating middle management and technical staff, and all the ingredients are in place for industrial intelligence, and at times espionage.

The loss came in the most traditional of Social Democratic strongholds. Hamburg is not only the home of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who campaigned hard over the last month there, but also of Defense Minister Hans Apel and the party's whip in the federal Parliament, Herbert Wehner.   The outcome was described on the state television network as a ''political earthquake.'' Not only was the vote a direct blow to the authority of the Chancellor, but it weakened the relationship between the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats, the junior partners in the Bonn coalition. The Free Democrats failed to win the 5 percent of the total vote that is necessary to enter the state parliament and appeared to be losing much of their weight as the decisive element in determining the distribution of power between the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats on the national level."

I.R.S.,"  Documents filed in the United States Tax Court for cases involving Nelson Bunker Hunt, the Texas billionaire, provide a rare public glimpse into the finances of one of America's most fiercely private and wealthy families.   The recently filed documents, the result of efforts by the Internal Revenue Service to recover more than $4 million in back taxes from Mr. Hunt for the years 1974 to 1977, show wild swings in his taxable income. In the years 1972 and 1973, Mr. Hunt had more than $100 million in personal taxable income, but in 1975, 1976 and 1977 he declared losses and paid virtually no Federal income taxes.   The Tax Court cases also provide insight into a number of Mr.  Hunt's sources of income as well as devices for avoiding taxes, including these examples:   - Mr. Hunt, in 1974, was a 5 percent investor in the partnership that owned the New York Yankees. The partnership claimed a loss of $4.4 million that year, based mostly on depreciation of $7.4 million in player contract costs, but the I.R.S., for unspecified reasons, is disallowing $2.8 million of the loss."

But relatively few are aware of what has recently become the most rapidly growing portion of this industry: tax-free money market funds that invest in short-term debt of state and local governments.   The tax-exempt funds, which are of increasing benefit to investors as their tax bracket rises to the maximum Federal income tax rate of 50 percent, are by no means a new invention. But in the last year or so, the assets of these funds - which have all the advantages and the disadvantages of money market funds in general - have proliferated."

After the close, Harvester confirmed that its pension fund had sold between $200 million and $300 million of equity securities to ''a major investment banker'' and bought fixedincome securities."

Most analysts stress, however, that no shortages at service stations are expected to result from the restrictions,   Although the allocations generally are keyed to, and often exceed, jobbers' average monthly gasoline purchases during the first three months of 1982, the industry has been rife with reports of spot shortages at the wholesale level.

As Mr. Greene recounts the story, the Liberians did not call their neighbor ''Guinea,'' but ''France,'' so pervasive was French colonial influence.   The anecdote, told in Mr. Greene's ''Journey Without Maps,'' is illuminating, for it sums up an aspect of European colonial rule in Africa that still has a strong impact more than two decades after foreign rule gave way to independence.   Where the British, personified in the aloof district officer, clad in starched knee-shorts and pith helmet, kept a reserved distance between the rulers and the ruled, the French sought to implant their notions of culture and civilization to a much deeper level, imposing a style of rule that was intended to stamp a sense of ''French-hood'' on territories and people far distant from Paris. Intermarriage Encouraged   Such was the French desire to fuse colonies and metropolitan France that, in 1902, a French scholar, known only as Dr. Barot, drew up the ground rules for marriage between colonial officers and African women in a book called ''A Practical Guide for Europeans in West Africa.''"

Paul M. Cook was convinced by his work for the Atomic Energy Commission almost 30 years ago that radiation chemistry -in particular, bombarding plastics with radiation - could produce unusual and useful materials.    Nevertheless, he shakes his head in happy amazement as he recalls the quiet niche-by-niche rise into the Fortune 500 of the Raychem Corporation, the company he founded in 1957 to pursue that conviction.   ''It's been a much more encompassing technology than I thought it was going to be,'' Mr. Cook, who is Raychem's president, said in an interview.   The first valuable thing Raychem learned to do by radiating plastic was to make it heat-shrinkable. Today, an almost incomprehensible variety of pipes, cables and wires are sealed, spliced or insulated by plastic materials that are shrunk to fit during installation using a blow torch or other heating devices."

Major Haddad, speaking with reporters this week, also said that many communities in southern Lebanon had asked to become part of his territory, which he calls Free Lebanon.   Leaning against his jeep as he talked with journalists, he said that his militia had played ''not too much'' of a role in the Israeli invasion.

But the consensus in Argentina's business community is that the financial strains and dislocations that the conflict in the South Atlantic have caused - combined with a wave of spending by the military - have guaranteed that inflation will soar in the months ahead, and that a free-market, belt-tightening experiment under Economics Minister Roberto Alemann is just about over.   Well-placed bankers, economists and business executives say that a protracted war with Britain could force Argentina into declaring a moratorium on payments of its foreign debt. Economist and Publisher   Thus far, Mr. Alemann, a respected economist and publisher, has insisted in public and in the policies he has directed that Argentina will honor payments on its approximately $34 billion in foreign debt - to the point of establishing an escrow account for the British share of the debt. ''Some people say he's even going too far in showing that we are going to meet our obligations,'' one Argentine banker said."

These sources are confident that the superior training and morale of the British professionals will be decisive.   The unknown ingredient in the tactical situation is how and where the British Fifth Brigade will be used.

That incident, the shooting of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo, set in motion a series of events that the world's most powerful leaders could not stop, and it has suddenly emerged at the heart of the discussion over the possibility of nuclear war in this age. Military planners, Government officials and foreign policy scholars stress that they do not believe a nuclear war is likely, but many add that they fear that one could grow out of the countless unpredictable events that occur each year.   ''You can think of a hundred ways in which nuclear war might start, and it could still start in a thoroughly unpredictable way,'' said Jerome B.

Dr. Neil Aggett, a young physician who worked for a predominantly black trade union, was said by the police to have committed suicide by hanging in the early hours of Feb. 5. About 14 hours earlier, the magistrate conducting the inquest was told, he signed a statement in which he declared that he had been assaulted by the security police and subjected to electric shocks during interrogation sessions.   Pieter J. Schabort, a lawyer retained by the police to protect their interests in the course of the Aggett inquest, argued tenaciously for an hour and a half today that the dead man's affidavit was inadmissible because the question of whether he was assaulted before his death had little or no bearing on the central question of how he died."

It is a subject normally of conjecture and rumor that South African newspapers cannot discuss directly as a result of stringent legislation giving the Defense Ministry a virtual veto on anything that is said about its activities.   But in testifying that his attempted coup had active backing from the Government here, Colonel Hoare appeared to confirm the widespread belief that Military Intelligence has gained a position of primacy in the South African security establishment since P.W.  Botha, who served as Defense Minister for 13 years, became Prime Minister in 1978.   In the mercenary leader's account, his contacts with the Government were initially with the National Intelligence Service, a civilian agency analogous to the Central Intelligence Agency. This unit was regarded as being in a dominant position under Mr. Botha's predecessor as Prime Minister, John Vorster, when it was known as the Bureau of State Security.

With all but a handful of journalists barred from the battle zone and information sifted through tight censorship, it is sometimes easier to get a sense of the Government's thinking from its 30-second television spots than from its official communiques.

From the pace of recent activity, however, there appears to be a growing sense of urgency at the troubled company.  After an impasse of several months, the manufacturer of trucks and farm equipment began bargaining with the United Automobile Workers this week, looking for concessions of $100 million annually.  Telegrams were delivered to suppliers recently asking them to freeze prices for the rest of the year. Top executives spent last weekend asking officials in Ohio and Indiana for state assistance to help keep two truck factories open.   The sick economy has killed Harvester's hopes of profits this year, and losses are mounting rapidly as cash is dwindling. The organization is adjusting to yet another management change (the last was in September) after the abrupt resignation in March of the former president, Warren Hayford. The outlook is so bleak that many analysts and lenders believe that Harvester may fail."

The successful attack on the destroyer Sheffield by an Exocet missile fired by a Super Etendard fighter-bomber, informed British military sources said, was likely to force the movement of the two carriers, the Hermes and the Invincible, and their protecting screen well east of the islands, out of range of further Argentine attack.   This would reduce the capacity of the fleet's Sea Harriers to cover a British landing on the islands.  The Harriers, British naval sources suggested, would now be used exclusively to patrol the air space beyond the fleet to avert another attack by Argentine planes flying from bases on the mainland."

The courtroom setting is familiar to Mr. Jackson, who is currently out on bail. He has been convicted four times on lesser counts, involving passing bad checks, forgery and burglary.   But this trial is different. In pretrial hearings over the last year, One-Eyed Jack has not been listening to the district attorney's office describe him as a small-time criminal, but rather as a kingpin in the electronics underground. Mr. Jackson has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.   The case against Mr. Jackson alleges that he both led a crime ring that stole 10,000 memory chips from the Intel Corporation, Silicon Valley's giant semiconductor manufacturer, and remarketed as many as 100,000 other similar devices, most of them stolen. The chips he is accused of stealing are Intel's 32K Eprom's, a highly specialized computer chip, worth $100 apiece at the time. But more important to the prosecutor's office and Federal investigators is the range of their application in electronic equipment - from harmless video arcade games to guidance systems aboard fighter aircraft."

T o answer these questions, let's go back to basics.  Like the weather, capitalist economies are fundamentally unstable.  This instability arises because of the incessant turbulence from new products or producers, changing tastes, as well as good or bad harvests.  But unlike the weather, the inertia of our economy is very great, and this inertia leads to persistent business cycles. Because cycles persist, it is possible - using the Promethean contribution of John Maynard Keynes -to stabilize the economy. Stabilization requires lowering interest rates (monetary policy), or lowering taxes and raising government outlays (fiscal policy) to expand the economy or the reverse to slow the economy or contain inflation."

With financing costs still higher than expected at 14 percent, dealers are less willing to hold Treasury issues whose yields are less than the cost of financing. The willingness to lighten inventories was one reason why the price of outstanding three-and six-month Treasury bills declined enough to increase their rates by about an eighth of a percentage point, to 12.3 percent, in secondary market trading.   At the regular weekly auction of new Treasury bills, however, financing costs were less of an immediate concern since dealers need not pay for their purchases until Thursday. Thus, they were willing to pay prices that resulted in average rates of 12.189 percent and 12.187 percent for three- and six-month bills, respectively. A week ago, the average auction rate was 12.25 percent for three-month bills and 12.24 percent for six-month bills."

The project is the planned 3,700-mile pipeline that will carry Soviet natural gas from Siberia to Western Europe -a Soviet order for as much as $15 billion worth of heavy machinery and largediameter steel pipe that the Europeans hope will ease their unemployment woes but that the Reagan Administration has sharply criticized.   While there are now several pipelines that move Soviet gas to Western Europe, the new one is expected to substantially increase the flow. Behind arguments about just how vulnerable America's NATO allies would be to the Russians' control over the gas is the fact that this project would inject a stimulating dose of orders and jobs into the faltering European capital goods industry at a time of deepening recession.   It is a fact Western European leaders cannot ignore. Unemployment in West Germany, Britain, Italy and France - whose leaders will join those of the United States, Canada and Japan at the summit meeting - rose to an 8.7 annual rate this year from 5.9 percent in 1980, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development."

As the North Atlantic alliance was being formed in the late 1940's, isolationist and internationalist politicians engaged in a grand debate over whether this country should commit large ground forces to the defense of Europe. The outcome was the stationing of several American divisions on the Continent.   In the late 1960's, as the Johnson and Nixon Administrations were groping toward the first major strategic arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, there was another major debate, over whether to develop and deploy antimissile defense systems. Opponents contended that the systems would upset the strategic balance that rested on mutual Soviet and American vulnerability, and they largely prevailed."

Currently, many states are also seeking a role in protecting the public, and the industry itself is spending millions to set up the National Futures Association for the same purpose.   All this has led many in the industry to raise this question, but always in private: Who is protecting the commodity brokers from the unscrupulous customer? After all, it is the commodity broker who is held responsible for every transaction by each commodity exchange's clearinghouse at the end of every business day, not the persons for whom they execute orders."

Mr. Sakharov commented in an interview that Mr. Andropov, in addition to being aware of the political situation in the United States, was interested in American popular music, favored Western alcoholic beverages such as Scotch and French cognac and had Western books in his home library ranging from ''How Green Was My Valley,'' by Richard Llewellyn, to ''Valley of the Dolls'' by Jacqueline Susann.

Or, a variant: another President becomes a little too obstreperous, so those same crew-cut young men with tattooed arms arrive by the banks of a jungle-fringed river, depose the leader and invite a new figure of their choice to ascend the steps of mortgaged power.   Often, the image becomes blurred, with whisperings of dark doings by agents from the French Secret Service working against the Paris Government, juggling African politicians like cardboard cutouts. The plot might be that of some tawdry thriller of the type that features aging C-47's rumbling low over mangrove swamps and white men with blacked-up faces fighting African soldiers on the steps of a stucco palace. Raw Material for Fiction   In the last four years, France has given the authors of such thrillers plenty of raw material to work on, with interventions in Zaire and the Central African Republic. And, these days, the visitor to French-speaking Africa can still see French soldiers on the streets of Bangui or Abidjan, wearing either their own uniforms or those of an African army in which they serve as advisers."

Critics of the Reagan Administration say the White House has placed insufficient emphasis on stopping nuclear proliferation. A policy put forth in a paper approved last month by President Reagan, they argue, will lead to increased distribution of plutonium, a material used in nuclear weapons, which will undermine efforts to slow the spread of atomic arms.   Administration officials deny that this will be the effect of the policy. But officials and private analysts agree that efforts to discourage the spread of nuclear arms have been severely complicated by growing international and regional tensions that put pressure on nations such as Israel and Argentina to develop and test atomic devices."

Having started as one of the most unpromising and undeveloped of African countries, with virtually no surfaced roads, it can now boast of being the most durable multiparty democracy in the Organization of African Unity. It can boast, too, that its politicans and public service are uncorrupt by any standards; and that it has achieved rates of capital investment and real economic growth - thanks to some stunning mineral discoveries, notably diamonds, and plenty of foreign aid -that are just as unusual.   But now when President Quett K. Masire tries to look into the immediate future he finds himself preoccupied by two problems that are almost entirely beyond his control. One is the decision of the International Diamond Cartel -managed by De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. of South Africa, a partner with Botswana in its three diamond mines here - to cut back drastically on its purchases in order to maintain the prices of gemstones."

By calling for the start of talks on strategic arms as soon as next month without any conditions, and in suggesting that he and Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, could achieve ''positive results'' when they agree on a time and place to sit down and talk, Mr. Reagan has moved a long way since his early post-election statements that tightly linked arms control talks with Soviet ''policies of aggression'' around the world.   Also, the generally firm but conciliatory speech in Eureka, Ill., in which he said that Soviet leaders shared his ''overriding interest in preventing the use of nuclear weapons,'' showed that after 16 months in office, Mr. Reagan was talking in a much more diplomatic way than in his first Presidential news conference, on Jan. 29, 1981, when he said that Soviet leaders had reserved ''the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat.''   Mr. Reagan, Administration officials said today, is being driven by a combination of factors. On the one hand, a senior aide said, despite the initial bluster of the Administration toward the Russians, Mr. Reagan personally has always believed in the value of discussion to resolve issues."

The so-called flash estimate of the gross national product in the second quarter shows that the economy grew six-tenths of 1 percent at an annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, according to Commerce Department figures.   This preliminary number, based on incomplete data for the quarter, is the first time that the G.N.P., the broadest measure of the nation's economy, has risen since the July-through-September quarter of last year. Eighth Since World War II   But while the recession, the eighth since World War II and the second in two years, appears to be over, according to the G.N.P.flash estimate, the economy could remain stagnant and the strength of the hoped-for recovery is unclear.

But hard times in the airline industry have changed that, and in a fight for passengers, the large carriers now have largely matched Midway's fares.   A one-way trip from Chicago to Philadelphia on Midway, United Airlines and Trans World Airlines, for instance, costs the same: $115. United has also matched Midway's $85 one-way fare to Omaha. For a one-way trip from Chicago to Washington, United, T.W.A. and American Airlines had met the Midway fare of $109 until recently, when United and American raised their fare to $136. They figured that most of the passengers on that route are business travelers who are not so concerned about fares."

Unless President Reagan makes a remarkable deal with Congressional leaders in a meeting with them today, the nation faces a string of the biggest deficits in its history. And, if nothing dramatic is done now, those deficits will climb in the next few years, weakening the national economy.   Congressional and White House budget negotiators, although unable to effect a deficit-shrinking compromise in the face of a deadlock between President Reagan and the Speaker of the House, Thomas P.  O'Neill Jr., have at least been facing up to that reality. They have agreed that, without additional budget savings, the following figures will result from the President's program:   Expenditures will climb from $742 billion in the current fiscal year to $827 billion in the fiscal year 1983, $918 billion in 1984 and $1,013 billion in 1985. In the aggregate, counting both military and social outlays, this represents hardly any slowdown in the rate of increase in Government spending."

During his stay, Mr. Mitterrand had sharp exhanges with Spanish leaders, notably King Juan Carlos, who declared bluntly in a dinner toast Tuesday night that ''the Europe of liberty'' should not offer a haven to terrorists who want ''to annihilate by force the social and political orders chosen in freedom by our peoples.''   In equally frank language, the French leader suggested that terrorism in the northern Basque provinces was rooted in Spain's social problems and not a result of France's longstanding policy of granting guerrillas political asylum. To the appeal from the King and other political figures that France hasten Spain's entry into the Common Market, Mr. Mitterrand said swift admission would add ''another misery to the current miseries of Europe.''"

A selling climax usually occurs over the course of a single day.  Share prices drop suddenly and precipitously as a result of unanswered margin calls. But during that same trading session, the market recovers with a rush as well-financed investors snap up bargains. After a true selling climax, the market will enter a prolonged recovery phase.   The extended market weakness of recent weeks may well have laid the foundation for a selling climax. Here is what has happened. The market weakness has meant lost equity for investors who borrowed to finance their share purchases. When the equity in a given account drops below a certain level, the customer's broker will send out a call for more money, or ''margin.''"

While the weather improved over the weekend, interest rates did not, and many analysts expect a further warping of prices this week.   Last week, for example, wheat buyers at Gulf of Mexico ports, the main export terminals, were paying a record premium of 60 cents a bushel over the Kansas City price as they scrambled to find enough grain to fill overseas orders and avoid having to pay high demurrage charges to ship owners whose vessels were riding idle at anchor.   In Kansas City last Friday, wheat prices were 23.75 cents a bushel higher than those in Chicago; the premium was 18.5 cents the week before. This distortion comes at a time when the new long ''unit trains'' are able to pick up huge loads at elevators and deliver as much as 100 carloads at once to Gulf terminals."

He said the United Nations was now predicting that the annual growth rate could fall to 1.5 percent by the year 2000. That would mean the world's population would reach 6.1 billion by the end of the century instead of the 7.5 billion that had been predicted."

With the ruling party of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi facing its own serious conflicts and internal tensions, the coming elections offer the opposition groups their best opportunity for recovering some of the influence they held until their Janata Party alliance disintegrated three years ago. At the same time, the same rivalries and personality clashes that undermined Janata are still making unity elusive if not impossible.   For example, Morarji R. Desai, 86 years old, the former Janata Prime Minister, said last week that he had been ''stabbed in the back'' by Charan Singh, 80, the leader of an agrarian populist faction that was a component of the Janata amalgam. Mr. Singh played his part in the discordant political fugue by expelling three influential Members of Parliament from his party after they advocated joining forces with other centrist offshoots of the Janata Party."

''To ease or not to ease'' was the way economists at Money Market Services Inc., a San Francisco-based consulting concern, described the choice faced by makers of monetary policy at this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.   The committee, made up of Federal Reserve Board governors and a rotating group of presidents from Federal Reserve Banks, seeks to chart a policy for money supply growth that is aimed at simultaneously encouraging stable prices, a healthy financial system and maximum employment.   The latest signals from the economy show that inflation is subsiding, but that bankruptcies are rising and unemployment is at a postwar high of 9.4 percent. At the same time, the closly watched M-1 measure of the money supply is more than $1 billion above the Fed's growth target of 2 1/2 to 5 1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982."

A one-third reduction would cut to about 5,000 the number of warheads for each nation.

F illed with sophisticated electronics, they brought a new dimension t o the battles that raged in Lebanon and the Falklands war. If there i s any lesson to be learned from these conflicts, it is that e lectronics have gone to war.   And so have such companies as I.B.M., RCA, Eaton, TRW and GTE Sylvania, hardly the sort of names that spring to mind when it comes to weaponry. These well-known companies and hundreds of others are providing the electronic gadgetry that makes these weapons so lethal. Along with a cluster of little-known companies that specialize in high-technology weaponry, they make the electronic brains that allow missiles to chase after their target, that render destroyers vulnerable to a single missile and that can turn an opponent's radar against him by making it a homing path for an enemy projectile.   More than a miracle of technology, electronic warfare is lucrative business. Worldwide sales of such products are expected to reach nearly $7 billion in 1982, according to the International Countermeasures Handbook, an industry trade publication. And analysts report that investor interest in makers of electronic war equipment has always been strong and remains so."

Lieut. Gen. Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri, the President of Argentina, beamed back and, in a pontifical gesture, turned from side to side, presenting himself with outturned hands to the crowd.   The scene Friday in the Plaza de Mayo as the crowd celebrated Argentina's seizure of the Falkland Islands was reminiscent of another time and another man, Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, who with his wife, Evita, filled that same plaza with admirers 30 years ago.   As if on cue, Julio Romero, a former Peronist governor of the province of Corrientes, returned from two years in exile in Paraguay Sunday and at an airport news conference praised General Galtieri as a man who could unite ''the armed forces and people as Juan Peron did.'' Political leaders here say it is an exaggeration, but most agree he has greatly enhanced his political power and future."

The ship, he reported, tried to escape and was fired upon. Mr. Hanrahan said ''a huge fireball stretching to the clouds'' rose from what British officers presumed to be an oil tanker.

Mr.  Reagan and House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. have said that a ''summit'' conference on the budget is in the offing.   The President has been loath to move from ''listening,'' with James A. Baker 3d as his ear on Capitol Hill, to a negotiating posture, lest he weaken his bargaining position. His aides had warned him against the danger of ''negotiating with himself'' by offering terms for a budget settlement before Congressional leaders could produce one of their own.   But there was danger that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress would be unable to reach a deal of their own unless the President took a hand in it. The Democrats were especially wary of agreeing to cuts in Social Security or other entitlement programs, and then finding that the President had moved to blame them for hurting the aged and the poor. And they hesitated to expose themselves to the possibility of a Presidential attack for undermining the nation's defenses or aggravating the recession by raising taxes. They insisted that a deal could not be made unless the President involved himself in the negotiating process and shared responsibility for the deal."

Haig Jr., even before Washington's declaration of support for London on Friday, of siding with the British in pursuit of American ''military-strategic goals in the South Atlantic.''   On Friday, when Washington announced limited sanctions against Argentina and support for Britain, the Soviet press agency Tass said: ''As is known, Washington from the very start vigorously supported its NATO partner, Britain, in its dispute with Argentina. Today's statements by Ronald Reagan and Alexander Haig mean only that Washington has discarded the mask of a 'mediator' between London and Buenos Aires, a role that it so far tried to play.''"

The committee adopted a resolution that omits the word ''freeze'' and commends the Administration for its strategic arms reduction plan. The resolution, adopted by a vote of 11 to 4 after a sharp debate, urges President Reagan to continue to refrain from undercutting the limitations of the first and second strategic arms limitation agreements with the Soviet Union as long as Moscow shows equal restraint.   The vote was the first Congressional test of support for a freeze on the production of nuclear weapons. The freeze movement has been gaining momentum as a result of a vigorous grass-roots campaign, but it has faced considerable skepticism in professional arms control circles."

Drysdale's inability to meet its debt payments prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in an unusual late-afternoon statement, to tell Government bond dealers that it ''stood ready as lender of last resort'' to help commercial banks meet ''unusual credit demands related to market problems.''   Drysdale had borrowed Government securities from other dealers, and its failure to pay interest on those borrowings could leave the dealers short of funds to meet their own obligations.

Rabbi Kahane's Israeli Kach movement, which last week deplored the killing and called the accused man, Alan H. Goodman, ''a sick Jew,'' is expected to make the murder case a political trial.   The movement, which was beaten in all national elections, has strongly attacked the Government policy that has given Moslems exclusive use of the Temple Mount as a place of worship and has assigned Jews the Wailing Wall at the foot of the mount.   Under Jewish religious law, the ground where the holy temple stood until its destruction 2,000 years ago is so sacred that it is forbidden to set foot there without going through a complex purification ritual."

The answer to that question is ''maybe,'' as is the answer to so many questions involving insurance coverage today. But in this instance, the ''maybe'' can be turned into a ''probably'' by purchasing a special replacement cost policy or rider to your existing policy.   In the standard homeowner's policy, the holder is reimbursed for the current cash value of the property, or cost minus depreciation.  For example, if a television set purchased for $500 three years ago had a current value of only $250, the policyholder would receive only $250 after a loss."

''All hypotheses are open,'' the President said, adding that he would not ''fall into hell'' if he was forced to devalue again. He complained about ''aggressive'' speculation against the franc and pointedly said that he had ''no religious attachment'' to the European Monetary System, which his predecessor, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, helped found in 1978."

Virtually all analysts agree that the coup had been expected for months and seemed somehow inevitable. In fact, several sources say, the coup's military planners were so careful and, for the first time in this nation's coup-ridden history, so open about their intentions that before finally seizing power they not only pushed publicly for a bigger role in Government but actually made inquiries into the likely reactions to its takeover by all the influential sectors of Bangladeshi society."

Primarily, the agreement provides for changes in the terms of Itel's equipment trust certificates, secured by railroad cars, the company said. Payment terms of the certificates would remain unchanged. The certificates account for more than 80 percent of Itel's secured debt."

The next morning, when the residents of this former Indian winter camp glance out their bedroom windows, they find regiments of bushy green trees billowing in gentle breezes.   The professor has not yet completed his theory to explain why, come September, those same city crews spread tons of dry old leaves on every yard for residents to rake into the street for cruising city bulldozers to remove. But his theory must be correct. Spring doesn't come to Toronto; it erupts here, well after it is entrenched to the south. And a special kind of happy spirit of appreciation seems to infect the place."

The Pope told a crowd estimated at more than 200,000 people squeezed into the Knavesmire Racecourse that marriage was an unbreakable alliance and that the future of society rested on family bonds.   While praising positive developments in family life, the Pope, who has taken a firm, conservative line on many social issues, said he ''could not fail to draw attention to the negative phenomena.''   In particular, he cited ''a corruption of the idea and experience of freedom, with consequent self-centeredness in human relations; serious misconceptions regarding the relationship between parents and children; the growing number of divorces; the scourge of abortion; the spread of a contraceptive and antilife mentality.''"

In a briefing this afternoon, Lieut. Col. Jim Donkin told of a 24-hour military engagement by outnumbered British forces in which the first shot was fired by the Argentine submarine Santa Fe, which was later disabled by British helicopters.   The operation included the landing of reconnaissance parties by helicopter in the mountains, a ''major bombardment'' of the main port, Grytviken, and a further battle in darkness at Leith, 10 miles up the coast.   Colonel Donkin, a member of the staff of the Royal Marines commander, said that 156 Argentine servicemen had been captured, together with the 38 scrap metal dealers whose arrival on South Georgia a month ago led to the present crisis."

However, the possibility of further actions - a freeze on Argentine assets in the U.S., for example - could induce a speedy end to the Falklands crisis. It seems that in the modern age, banks can do more damage than battleships.   The Argentinian effort is the latest in a series that began in Iran, flowed into Afghanistan and was most recently seen in Poland and Eastern Europe, a region where official pressure on banks to rethink loan polices and portfolios continues."

The signing clears the way for talks on rescheduling the repayments that Poland is due to make this year, but the declaration of martial law in Poland in December has made it likely that the banks will await directions from their governments before reaching an accord on this debt."

Methodically, it exploited these central European strengths to haul energy and raw materials from Eastern Europe, and to ship its products and skills around the world.   Then came the oil shocks of 1973-74, and Voest began to look beyond steel for lines of business that could help it withstand recession and soaring energy costs.   In 1980, as overcapacity and collapsing prices sparked Europe's worst postwar steel crisis, the company also began to have second thoughts about its ties to Eastern Europe, which in good years accounted for 30 percent of sales. The doubts began to emerge as a series of financial problems shook Poland and Rumania, two of Voest's best customers."

LIMITED IN BRITAIN,"  Because of an obscure Common Market regulation, nearly all of Britain's largest and most venerable companies are being forced to drop the unmistakably British ''Ltd.'' from the end of their corporate names.   Such companies as British Petroleum, Unilever and the National Westminster Bank will henceforth end their official designations with ''PLC,'' a not entirely elegant abbreviation of public limited company.   The change arose from the Common Market's Second Directive, adopted in 1976, which set uniform definitions for limited liability companies. Among the requirements was that public and private limited companies be distinguished in name, something that only Britain, among the major Common Market members, did not do. West Germany, for example, uses A.G. (stock company) for publicly traded companies and G.m.b.H. (company with limited liability) for privately held or subsidiary companies."

The Argentine attack on the Falklands itself largely stemmed from economic troubles.   The effort of the Government of Lieut. Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri to bring inflation, running at more than 100 percent, under control by tightening the growth of the money supply, devaluing the peso and liberalizing imports resulted in growing unemployment, falling real wages and reduced living standards for the working class.   Demonstrators had taken to the streets against the Government in the week before Argentina seized the Falklands. It is hard to believe that the Government did not undertake the invasion as a means of distracting the people and unifying them against a common ''enemy,'' Britain. Strong Argentine nationalism was there to be exploited."

They are usually assigned to provide antiaircraft protection to the aircraft carriers Hermes and Invincible in the British battle fleet.   Unofficial reports said the American-made Argentine jets were brought down in dense fog and cloud by new shipborne Sea Wolf missiles 20 or 30 miles west of the Falklands. The Sea Wolf had never before been fired in anger. It was said that the jets had been acting as escorts to transport planes trying to run the British blockade."

For the British Government it is a diplomatic triumph, because cancellation would have been cited by Argentina as ''proof'' that Britain was an aggressor.   As part of the bargaining with the Vatican, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher agreed that neither she nor other members of her Government would meet the Pope during his stay.

As they have mushroomed, the funds have transformed the role of the consumer from one of unwitting subsidizer of business loans and home mortgages into a full-fledged investor with access to the same high market interest rates as the big institutions. While they have not increased the total pool of savings, most economists say, they have clearly altered the flows.   Most notably, the funds pulled deposits away from the nation's thrift institutions, operating under Federal regulation and holding large portfolios of low-interest mortgages. And they encroached on the traditional preserves of commercial banks as well."

Because of the restrictions on political life in the Communist world, the cultural milieu, more than in Western countries, makes up for the absence of an open exchange of political ideas by funneling a measure of unorthodoxy into public life.   From the late 1950's through the mid-60's and again in the 70's, Poland's theater and films treated subjects drawn from real life with a minimum of the smile-even-if-it-hurts optimism that is required by socialist realism, the Communist approach to culture. Music and graphic and plastic arts went their own way and Polish writers, by constantly pushing at the borders of the permissible, carved out for themselves a considerable area of literary freedom."

This was partly the purpose of the talks Gen.

The letter, presented by the chief American negotiator, Edward L.  Rowny, to the Soviet delegation chief, Viktor P. Karpov, blamed a Soviet missile buildup for the instability, but said the talks were a historic opportunity ''to reverse this process and to reduce substantially both the numbers and the destructive potential of nuclear forces.''   ''As the two leading nuclear powers in the world, the United States and the Soviet Union are trustees for humanity in the great task of ending the menace of nuclear arsenals and transforming them into instruments underwriting peace,'' the President's letter said. Mr.  Reagan said he was confident that with seriousness on the Soviet side, positive results could be achieved. First in 3 Years   The meeting at the Soviet Mission on the Avenue de la Paix was the first on strategic weapons between the two countries in more than three years. The discussions, which basically deal with intercontinental ballistic missiles and long-range bombers, are a complement to Soviet-American talks on European-based intermediaterange missiles, which began here last November."

They chanted anti-British slogans and demanded a restoration of democracy.   Though small, the rally, which was not troubled by the police, gave the flavor of long suppressed forces that have increasingly come to the surface of Argentina's political life since the Argentine takeover of the Falkland Islands on April 2. Laying wreaths on a monument dedicated to laborers, the trade unionists observed a minute of silence for a comrade who died in Mendoza after the police had repressed a demonstration on March 30 against economic conditions."

Sound good? It gets better. When stockholders meet at the end of April, they are expected to approve a plan that would match employee savings dollar for dollar. In addition, the funds in the thrift plan are not taxed as they accumulate and receive favorable treatment at termination.   The plan is certainly liberal, but not unusual at major oil companies and at other companies where employee benefits are generous. In fact, said Ron Leibig, domestic benefits director at Phillips, the reason benefits are being expanded is to stay competitive with the rest of the oil industry. ''The new plan puts us right up at the top now,'' he said."

Indeed, that has been the pattern of past business cycles. But many analysts are questioning just how much of a drop in short-term business borrowing - and interest rates - is likely this time.   Without an increase in sales of long-term bonds and notes, it is generally agreed that businesses will continue to rely on shortterm, variable-rate borrowings. It's a vicious cycle, economists say, since too much reliance on short-term borrowing puts upward pressure on money supply growth and short-term interest rates, which in turn helps keep long-term rates high enough to discourage issuance of notes and bonds."

Mr. Perez de Cuellar has been exploring what forces might replace British troops in the islands, the nature of a United Nations administration there and the conduct under United Nations auspices of face-to-face talks between Britain and Argentina, they said.   The Secretary General has also been pursuing one last effort to reduce bloodshed and lessen Argentine humiliation in what are regarded here as the final days of the conflict: He has been talking to the British about deliberately slowing their advance on Stanley, the islands' capital.

The United States appeal came as Common Market leaders, meeting in Brussels, issued a call for a simultaneous withdrawal of Israeli and Palestinian military forces from Beirut. The Western Europeans also repeated a condemnation of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. (Page A12.)"

In part, State Department officials said, this course was dictated when Prime Minister Menachem Begin told President Reagan on Thursday that he would agree to a cease-fire but would not pull Israeli forces out until certain conditions were met -namely, the creation of a Lebanese government free of Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization pressure and the ending of the use of Lebanese territory as a military base for attacks on Israel.   Officials said Middle East experts advised Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. that, because Mr. Begin was adamant, there was no way the United States could obtain an Israeli withdrawal except as part of an overall settlement of the Lebanese crisis. As a result, the Administration decided to welcome Israel's announcement today of a cease-fire and not to make an issue of Israel's refusal to accept the United Nations Security Council demand for an immediate withdrawal."

Because the futures allow the dealers to hedge, or insure, their inventory and other risks against adverse price moves.   Not only must the dealers hedge because the uncertainty over interest rates has made the Government securities prices as volatile as any other investment; they are also constantly ''pawning'' their inventory in order to raise cash with which to buy more of the Treasury's paper.

The step, an experiment in securing better prices for investors, already has some of Wall Street's most established firms fretting for the future of the nation's securities markets.   This new system, though limited, is heightening the rivalry between the stock exchanges, with their near-monopoly over trading in the best known stocks, and some brokerage houses, which itch to buy and sell shares themselves, without any need to cut the exchanges in.   A new electronic network is being introduced as a way to insure that investors get the best price for their shares. But the moment the system starts working, it will put traders at those brokerage houses on an equal footing with their long established counterparts on the stock exchange floor.

After having long been a minor commercial partner of the Soviet Union, Argentina in 1980 jumped to second place among the developing countries doing business with the Russians, who bought almost onefourth of all Argentine exports. Last year Argentina moved into first place among developing countries trading with the Russians, edging out India, the former leader.   The surge in Soviet-Argentine trade resulted from the imposition of a United States grain embargo on the Soviet Union after its military intervention in Afghanistan in late 1979. The Russians turned to Argentina for grain supplies, and Argentine exports jumped fourfold in 1980 compared with the 1979 level."

One prominent dealer who requested anonymity, although he said his house was not involved with Drysdale's operations, said that many dealers think they can ignore what happened because the securities involved were Treasuries and not commercial paper or other privatesector instruments.

But while incentive options do offer executives c onsiderable tax advantages, they are also more costly for businessest han the usual ''nonqualified'' options, and some management s pecialists felt this would dampen the companies' enthusiasm.   The results are beginning to come in, and it seems that the doubters were wrong. The incentive stock option is rapidly becoming a standard offering in the compensation plans of large American companies. Almost 85 percent of 200 prominent corporations surveyed plan to offer incentive stock options in the future, according to findings recently released by Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, a New York employee benefit consulting firm. The firm also analyzed the 1981 proxy statements of two-thirds of the country's largest 100 corporations and found that 52 percent had already adopted incentive option plans, including such giants as Exxon, Mobil, Ford, Chrysler, American Can, Bendix and Du Pont."

Although the Reagan Administration has lowered the safety net a bit, the basic structures remain intact and there is no discussion of eliminating the core programs of the Great Society, such as food stamps, Medicaid and Medicare. Indeed, in future history, President Reagan may be more famous for sanctifying the Great Society than for cutting it, just as President Eisenhower placed the Republican seal of approval on the New Deal."

Most of the students who emerge from this elite campus for choice jobs in industry will come no closer to steel mills than the case studies they dissected. But from this cloistered world, two professors, Robert H. Hayes and William J. Abernathy, have come forth with a stream of articles and ideas that are beginning to reshape the thinking of American business about why the nation's bedrock industries, such as autos and steel, have withered in the face of foreign competition.   The two men's teachings are challenging what is taught in the best business schools, promulgated by armies of consultants, and honed to a high polish at such citadels of management as the General Electric Company. With some success, they are chipping away at such notions as blaming the ills of American industry on heavy-handed regulation, the avarice of labor unions, the decline of the work ethic, the oil crisis or the Japanese."

As desirable as lower interest rates would be during a recession, many economists said the Federal Reserve has little leeway to bring rates down by pumping more money and credit into the economy.  Shortterm rates have fallen in the last month, as the Fed made credit more available, but analysts said that course of action cannot continue long without igniting expectations of rising inflation, which in turn would cause lenders to demand higher interest rates.   Reductions in estimated Federal budget deficits would help lower rates by reducing Treasury borrowings, but many analysts on Wall Street do not expect meaningful progress on that front until after the fall elections."

The community outlined some of the steps it thought Japan should take.   This challenge to Japanese policies by the Common Market, as the community is generally known, is the broadest ever undertaken under provisions of the GATT treaty. It stems from growing frustration with the inability of businesses in Common Market countries to penetrate the Japanese market. The Europeans' trade deficit with Japan has reached about $14 billion a year."

Western diplomats predicted that pressure from Islamic fundamentalists and even the docile opposition parties would mount on the issue of the invasion.

The new acts, which will add to the many restrictions already placed on political demonstrations as well as on the reporting of what are deemed to be matters of internal security, were presented as a refinement of the existing security laws. The authorities thus retain their full arsenal of arbitrary powers to ban organizations and publications; to silence individuals and bar them from political activities, or to detain them indefinitely without any charge or recourse to lawyers or the courts.   The Government of Prime Minister P.W. Botha draws a connection between the proposed political changes and the maintenance of such controls. ''In times of reform, the conflict potential is normally higher than in other times,'' the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jan Christian Heunis, told foreign journalists. ''Because we are a society in transition, it is unavoidable that tensions will rise.''"

Whether that process should be termed subsidy or' 'blackmail,'' as others have suggested, is open to serious question.  During most of the first quarter, the companies were paying the official OPEC price of $34 a barrel while the spot market crude oil price was much lower. To do so in the face of earnings declines and continuing oversupply indicates that the partners in the Arabian American Oil Company found themselves relatively powerless to object to: (A) paying a $5 a barrel premium for Saudi oil, and (B) lifting approximately 5 million barrels of oil daily, whether they wanted that much or not. The four oil companies continue to carefully avoid protesting openly, presumably for fear of evoking Saudi anger that could lead to permanent expulsion of the first company to protest too much."

It is the gift of oneself to the other. It is a love to be proclaimed before the eyes of the whole world. It is unconditional.   The love of husband and wife in God's plan leads beyond itself and new life is generated, a family is born.  Christian marriage is a sacrament of salvation. It is the pathway to holiness for all members of a family. With all my heart, therefore, I urge that your homes be centers of prayer; homes where families are at ease in the presence of God; homes to which others are invited to share hospitality, prayer and the praise of God."

Until today the crucial factors favoring a major assault never quite lined up, and the risks seemed greater than the potential benefits.   This time, however, Mr. Begin decided to make the military gamble and to pay the political costs that he and his advisers know exist.  The crucial reason was the intensive shelling of northern Israel by forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which began Friday afternoon after Israeli air strikes on Palestinian bases near Beirut.    The Israeli command described the air raids as retaliation for the shooting Thursday of Israel's Ambassador to Britain, Shlomo Argov, who was critically wounded in London. Five suspects, all traveling on passports from Arab countries, were captured. The P.L.O. denied any responsibility for the attack."

The underlying and more important purpose is peace: not peace at any price, but peace with freedom and justice.   Leaders of countries from every part of the globe come to this session in search of surer ways of preserving that peace. Ways that enable the peoples of each sovereign state to lead their lives as they choose within established borders.   If arms control helps us to achieve those central aims more surely and at less cost, we must pursue it vigorously. But if it is carried out in a way which damages peace, we must resist it, recalling that there have been occasions when the known or perceived military weakness of an opponent has been at least as potent a cause of war as military strength. The true definition of disarmament should be the balanced and verifiable reduction of armaments in a manner which enhances peace and security."

At the center of the dispute, as always, stands the Federal Reserve Board, and the Fed, faced with a continuing sharp recession, is in the tightest corner it has been since its chairman, Paul A. Volcker, set his anti-inflation course in October 1979.   Mr. Volcker and other governors of the Fed, according to interviews with members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, contend that they have very little room to maneuver in and, at each turning point, face the risk of prolonging the recession, thwarting the recovery or losing much of the ground that has been gained on inflation."

With the conflict apparently near its climax, the Reagan Administration told Argentina privately and publicly that unless it accepted the two-month-old Security Council resolution calling for Argentina to withdraw its troops, there was nothing the United States would do to prevent an all-out British attack on the Falkland capital of Stanley.   Administration officials said the Argentines had been told that Washington would prefer the hostilities to end through an agreed, negotiated settlement that would lay the basis for some Argentine role in the future of the islands. But Argentina has also been told that it is risking the destruction of its forces on the Falklands if it does not agree to withdraw."

Moreover, United States forces held in reserve, such as an Army division in Hawaii and a Marine division in California, could be deployed to the Persian Gulf rather than to Northeast Asia as reinforcements.   To carry out that strategy, officials say, the Administration is insisting that Japan and South Korea increase their responsibilities for security in Northeast Asia.

No, says Michael Novak in his new book, ''The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism,'' published by Simon & Schuster. In fact, Mr. Novak pronounces democratic capitalism the best of all political-economic systems, in ideal as well as in results. His book is an against-the-grain examination of the theological and moral foundations of capitalism and of why, as he sees it, the system works so well. WHAT do I mean by ''democratic capitalism''? In short, three d ynamic and converging systems functioning as one: a democratic p olity, an economy based on markets and incentives and a m oralcultural system which is pluralistic and, in the largest sense, l iberal. Social systems like those of the United States, West Germanya nd Japan (with perhaps a score of others among the world's nations) i llustrate the type.   Democratic capitalism is neither the Kingdom of God nor without sin. Yet all other known systems of political economy are worse. Such hope as we have for alleviating poverty and for removing oppressive tyranny -perhaps our last, best hope - lies in this much despised system. A never-ending stream of immigrants and refugees seeks out this system."

Cities Service, in a move aimed at cutting off the financing for Mesa's bid, may sue its bankers to force them to testify about what they know of the takeover plan, sources close to Cities Service said. Other sources said that Cities Service was attempting to ''scare off'' Mesa's bankers, thought to be the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago and the Bank of Montreal."

They agreed that no early end to the recession is in sight and that six million more people are likely to become jobless this year, raising the total number of unemployed in their counries to more than 30 million.   The ministers, attending the annual meeting of the Organizaton for Economic Cooperation and Development, which monitors the economic performance of its member nations, promised to keep trying to reduce inflation, preserve free trade and modernize industry.   But their final communique shows they remain seriously divided over how to tackle the crises gripping their countries' economies. ''The message is not a very pleasant one,'' said Emile van Lennep, secretary general of the organization, in summing up the ministers' work at a final news conference."

In its first session, the Assembly enacted legislation that effectively annulled the plan of the previous Government to make peasant cooperatives out of 1,700 of the country's large farms.   And last Thursday, the rightist-dominated Assembly suspended the ''land to the tiller law,'' which permitted peasants to buy the small plots they were working as tenant farmers or sharecroppers. The suspension was for one crop year, which for sugar cane, one of El Salvador's main crops, is four calendar years."

It began when Mr. Costa Mendez took office last December, asserting that it was ''time to produce concrete results'' to return the Falkland Islands, known here as the Malvinas, to Argentine hands.   The recent military intensification of Argentina's efforts to fulfill that quest has forced the 59-year-old longtime diplomat to inch along a narrow path between conflicting sets of values, not always with the desired outcome.   A member of a wealthy, patrician Argentine family, Mr. Costa Mendez said early on, for example, that the realities of Argentina's economy placed the country above the ranks of third-world nations. These types of remarks have not heightened the country's popularity with its Latin American neighbors."

Would you forgive me if I say it is a special day for me also? Over the years since I sat where you of the graduating class of 1982 are now sitting, I've returned to the campus many times, always with great pleasure and warm nostalgia. It isn't true that I just came back to clean out my locker in the gym.   On one of those occasions, I addressed a graduating class here, ''neath the elms,'' and was awarded an honorary degree. I informed those assembled that while I was grateful for the honor, it added to a feeling of guilt I'd been nursing for 25 years. I always figured the first degree I was given was honorary."

Taken at face value, the account in the Government newspaper Izvestia was a rebuff to anyone imputing other than altruistic motives to the Soviet Union. It said 7,000 Vietnamese students, aged 17 to 35, had arrived for training in some 50 trades under a year-old agreement that provided for them to remain for a year, earning regular Soviet wages.   Far from being assigned to northern Siberia and other inhospitable areas, as some Western reports have suggested, Izvestia said that the Vietnamese, whose homeland is in the tropics, were working in ''regions with the most suitable climate for them.'' It named cities across the southern tier of the Soviet Union, from Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea to the Altai area of south Siberia."

A production of ''How I Got That Story'' at the Westside Arts Theater was delayed 15 minutes. Even though the house lights were working fine, the stage lights and a slide show would not work because they were controlled by computers, which had lost their memory.

The State Department added that the sinking, after a torpedo attack by a British submarine, ''pointed out the absolute necessity of reaching a peaceful settlement to this tragic conflict.''   Earlier today, when the Argentine Government said the ship was ''presumed sunk,'' the news had a chilling effect in the Administration here.   Later, the effect was magnified when the Argentine high command confirmed the sinking and reported that as of late tonight 123 men of the 1,042 men aboard had been rescued from the icy seas."

Last week, the debate took another twist when the chairman of the C.F.T.C., Philip McBride Johnson, asked Congress in effect to overturn a Federal court ruling in his agency's favor, and to support a four-month-old informal jurisdictional pact with his counterpart at the S.E.C., John S.R. Shad.   What provoked this unusual display of amity between the two formerly contentious agencies was a ruling on March 25 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago that said the Chicago Board Options Exchange had to obtain the approval of the C.F.T.C. to trade in options on Government National Mortgage Association certificates.   The Chicago options exchange had previously applied for and was granted such approval by the S.E.C. This infuriated the exchange's parent, the Chicago Board of Trade, because it wanted to trade Ginnie Mae options. Consequently, the big futures exchange filed suit to prevent its estranged offspring from using its S.E.C. approval to steal a march on it. The Chicago Board of Trade contended that only the Commodity Futures Trading Commission could approve the options, and this was upheld by the appeals court."

Although some influential Venezuelans have been pressing their Government for aggressive action against Guyana, including an invasion, the administration of President Luis Herrera Campins has said repeatedly that it will seek a peaceful solution to its claim to the land, which is slightly larger than New York State. It is widely believed here that the dispute, a highly nationalistic issue for Venezuelans as well as Guyanese, will not develop into war.   The land, called the Guyana Essequibo, covers 53,000 square miles between the Essequibo River in Guyana, formerly British Guiana, and the present border with eastern Venezuela. The disputed territory is potentially more valuable to Guyana, a poor nation with fewer than a million people, than to Venezuela, an oil-producing country with some 16 million people and petroleum exports last year worth more than $19 billion."

The United States has avoided taking sides in the Falklands sovreignty dispute, hoping to create an atmosphere favorable to diplomatic efforts.

The issue of changing money supply growth targets is ticklish because the two most closely watched money supply measures - M-1 and M-2 - are already growing faster than planned. M-1 consists of currency, checking and check-like deposits, and M-2 includes M-1 plus small savings accounts, noninstitutional money market mutual funds and certain overnight bank borrowings.   Gradual reductions year after year in the growth of money supply are the cornerstone of the Fed's anti-inflation policy, but there is much room for disagreement in deciding just how much money supply growth can be allowed without igniting fears of more inflation in future years."

Officials in Jerusalem, who say Soviet experts may have been giving military advice to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, believe that Moscow's ability to influence a post-Khomeini regime in Iran is being enhanced by an absence of any American influence.   ''In spite of all Iran has done to the United States,'' a wellplaced Israeli official said, ''the United States cannot afford to permit Iran to be totally and unreservedly anti-American and leave the field open to Soviet penetration.''   Israel's small-scale sales of military equipment to Iran, which were confirmed by Defense Minister Ariel Sharon in a television interview Wednesday in Washington, have had no effect on the war or on Iran's policies, officials here say.

(The disclosure came as an emergency council representing Lebanon's major factions met in Beirut to discuss ways of ending the Israeli siege of the city. The council meeting, its first, made no progress.  Page A10.)"

They have been engaged in an increasingly determined effort to sell the Mexicans an unusual piece of merchandise - a nuclear power plant that they hope will open the door to many others.   Their job isn't getting any easier. Last Tuesday the Mexican Government announced that any decision on Mexico's nuclear energy program would be shelved until at least December, when the next administration takes over. And with Mexico now pinched by declining oil revenues and a huge foreign debt, there are doubts that a decision on the program will be taken much before 1984.   For the world's nuclear power industry, which has pinned its hopes on Mexico's plans to buy as many as 20 nuclear reactors, the announcement could set back efforts to throw off a severe slump in sales. Vendors sold just 10 reactors last year, mainly in heavily oil-importing countries, and they have been viewing Mexico's proclaimed eagerness to become a major generator of nuclear power as perhaps the best opportunity to sell reactors for the next decade.  Orders are drying up in advanced industrialized nations, and even such eager customers as South Korea are slowing their atomic programs, largely because of slower growth in electricity demand."

A zero-coupon bond is one that is issued at a huge discount - often at one-third to one-quarter of its face value - and then redeemed at full face value when it matures eight or 10 years later. In the interim, investors clip no coupons and receive no periodic interest - hence, the name zero coupon.   But at maturity, they receive a lump sum payment representing the principal they have lent the issuer, usually a large corporation, plus the interest that has accrued on the bond. Several brokerage firms are promoting zero-coupon bonds as ''money-multiplier notes,'' which can be bought for as little as $250 and redeemed in 10 years for $1,000. Eight-year bonds can be bought for about $333 and fiveyear bonds for $500. Yields are currently hovering around 13 1/2 percent."

In that event, British analysts said, the expected elimination of Argentine military power on the Falkland Islands would not end the conflict but would usher in a period of hit-and-run warfare by air and sea in which the islands' British garrison and supply lines would be under constant attack.   Although British officials do not believe that additional weapons can prevent an eventual British victory in the war, they fear that their delivery to Argentina would insure continuation of the conflict.

But a three-year-long sales slump has worsened t his year, as a critical surplus of stereo components threatens the i ndustry's profitability as prices plummet.   Many factors have contributed to the industry-wide recession: intense competition from different electronic entertainment products, most notably video; shrinkage of the key 18- to-24-year-old age group, which buys most audio equipment; tightening of consumer credit in the late 1970's, and the general recessionary economy that has reduced consumer interest in many luxury goods.   There is no formal industry-wide technical definition of hi-fi equipment.

New Treaty Is Aim   Today in Geneva, General Rowny, who retired from the army in 1979 to be free to oppose the strategic arms limitation treaty signed that year, began the task of attempting to negotiate with the Soviet Union a new treaty on reductions in long-range nuclear weapons."

John Kean, N.U.I.'s lithe, mustachioed president, found the going tricky. It is barely possible to breathe on the floor, an untidy labyrinth where the stocks of America's major corporations are traded. New ones join and old ones leave on about a weekly basis.  N.U.I. was the 32d listing this year and was neither more nor less momentous than the others."

Haig Jr.'s diplomatic efforts had apparently failed to produce a solution in the Falklands crisis. They said heavy fighting between Argentina and Britain was likely to begin in the next day or so unless there was an unexpected development.   Mr. Haig, in a closed-door briefing for the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, said that he had not completely given up hope for a diplomatic solution but that there was little chance that fighting over the Falkland Islands could be averted.   According to several participants in the meeting, Mr. Haig added that once it became apparent there was no longer a plausible prospect for a negotiated settlement, the Administration would publicly make it clear that it stood with Britain in the crisis. He left open the possibility that, even if fighting began, there might still be an opportunity for a diplomatic solution."

Mr. Nott told a sad and solemn House of Commons that the 3,500-ton destroyer Coventry had capsized after being bombed and strafed at the northern entrance to Falkland Sound and that the 15,000-ton container ship Atlantic Conveyor, requisitioned from Cunard for use as a makeshift aircraft carrier, had been crippled by two Exocet missiles.   A total of 24 men were killed on the two ships, bringing known British losses to 100, he said, and about 25 others were wounded. Bleak Day for Britain   British officials freely acknowledged that Tuesday, National Day in Argentina, had been the bleakest of the war for this country. But they said they had continued to chip away at Argentine air strength, shooting down four Skyhawks and a fifth, unspecified plane."

Miss Avagliano went straight from college to Sumitomo Shoji America Inc., an American subsidiary of one of Japan's largest trading companies. Starting in 1976, Miss Avagliano earned $170 a week for reading and sorting telexes, sending out estimates and invoices, and doing general secretarial work. It wasn't long before she felt stuck in her job.   ''You just knew you weren't going to get anywhere,'' she said. ''I was doing the same job as most of the Japanese men, but I knew it was useless to think I could have the same opportunities, even though I had as much education. All the women were in clerical jobs. I think they really honestly thought women were inferior.''   So together with 11 other women employees, Miss Avagliano filed an employment discrimination complaint against Sumitomo. Miss Avagliano, whose name has been spelled Avigliano on all the court papers, has since left Sumitamo, as have all but one of the other plaintiffs."

But now, in the wake of the triumph over Argentina, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher seems prepared to lead a nationalist revival. In the euphoria of victory, she has sounded increasingly like Charles de Gaulle, increasingly determined to tell the world that Britain is quite able to work out its own solutions to its own problems.   Thus in her statement to the House Commons on Tuesday, Mrs.  Thatcher emphasized several times the ''will to succeed'' that this country had shown in the Falklands. And she angrily told Michael Foot, the opposition leader, that British servicemen had not died in the Falklands so she could turn the islands over to international control."

Given the pinch, there is widespread conjecture that Hungary and East Germany, once the Eastern bloc's economic showcases, may follow Poland and Rumania in asking to delay debt payments."

Augustine became the first Archbishop of Canterbury and I rejoice that the successors of Gregory and Augustine stand here today in the church which is built on their partnership in the Gospel.   We shall trace and celebrate our beginnings in this service by reaffirming our baptismal vows made at the font at the beginning of Christian life and by saying together the creed, an expression of the heart of our common Christian faith, composed in the era before our unhappy division. The emphasis, then, will be on the riches of what we share and upon the existing unity of the Christian church, which transcends all the political divisions and frontiers imposed upon the human family. One of the gifts Christians have to make to the peace of the world is to live out the unity that has already been given them in their common love of Christ."

This kind of attack, military analysts said, is one of the most terrifying and the one most likely to sap the defenders' will to resist. Three factors worsen the Argentines' plight. The first is that the ground troops have meager means to respond. Fire against the destroyers and frigates of the British fleet is likely to be ineffective. These ships reach their positions after nightfall and move constantly. Without air observation, the Argentine gunners are at a serious disadvantage."

Some of the activists are Marxists and some are religiously inspired, but many are apolitical young people who have left middleclass comforts to go to the countryside, much like some of the civil rights volunteers in the United States who went to the South in the 1960's.   The efforts of these groups range in scale and effectiveness from a huge dairy cooperative with 400,000 prospering members to a rural medical clinic run by a husband and wife and young doctors who have spurned private practice.   There are at least several thousand such groups, though attempts to count them have been incomplete. It is a decentralized movement in a basically decentralized society, but according to some of India's most respected political scientists and commentators, the aggregate effect of their work is becoming a significant factor. The social activism, the commentators say, is moving into the vacuum left by the decay of older political institutions."

Mr. Lee himself is believed to have inspired the plan. Once started in the schools, about two years from now, it would reassert values of filial piety, scholarly discipline, fraternity, decorum, integrity, a proper sense of shame and, perhaps, a moral obligation to enter government service so long as Confucianism prevailed in the state.   Confucianism was the official and mostly very conservative state philosophy of China for nearly 2,000 years. Its influence on ethics and social behavior has survived to the present in some sectors of ethnic Chinese society, and some scholars believe that even in China the reaction over the last few years against the Cultural Revolution may be viewed as a reassertion of Confucian values."

For the first time in 20 years, a significant increase in television outlets is possible.   The commission is even now burrowing its way from under 6,500 applications, and thousands more are expected to be filed before the process is completed, according to F.C.C. officials. When the dust settles, it is expected that some 4,000 stations will have been created by the new policy. One major question is whether they will be, as originally planned, stations to serve neighborhoods and ethnic groups - or whether the profit potential will turn them into big business run by big business.   Low-power stations will differ from conventional television in several significant ways. Their power output will be limited to 10 watts for VHF stations and 1,000 watts for UHF stations, which means that under most circumstances their reach will be limited to a radius of 10 to 20 miles. They will be subject to fewer regulations than conventional stations, but where their signals interfere with existing ''full-service'' stations, the low-power station must give way."

None of the countries of the continent altered their previous positions in the dispute. The assault had been forecast for some time in all Latin capitals and consequently did not provoke the vigorous notes of official protest or spontaneous street demonstrations that an unexpected escalation of the conflict might have.   The most dramatic reactions came from Venezuela and Peru, the two countries that have been most vocally behind Argentina since the conflict arose more than seven weeks ago. Colombia and Brazil continued to be the most reserved in their comments."

Officers of First National, the country's 17th-largest bank, said they hoped the move would encourage other banks to drop their prime from the 16 1/2 percent level, which has prevailed at most major banks since Feb. 23."

The speech contained no direct attacks on the Reagan Administration and was generally cautious in tone. But it conveyed a sense of concern about the impact on East-West relations of Washington's attempts to slow construction of the pipeline, which would bring Siberian gas to Western Europe by the end of 1984."

But as we look beyond our immediate troubles, the f uture does seem promising, for we are experiencing major structural c hanges in the age composition of the population which could make fore xtraordinary differences in our economic affairs.  The demographic timetable that accounted at least in part for our malaise in the past decade or so will be working in our favor in the coming years. A review of our recent past gives some insights into the potential of our future."

Vietnamese officials said they would have to discuss the detailed, seven-page proposal from the Vietnam Veterans of America before agreeing to the study. Dr. Ton Buc Lang, a Vietnamese researcher, acknowledged that there was still lack of scientific proof of the agent's harmful effects."

They also begged, posed for photographs, laughed if the visitors smiled, stared somberly, and occasionally scattered when a khaki-clad policeman or some other government agent stabbed his finger down the boulevard and told them to go away.   There are uncounted thousands of the offspring of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers in Vietnam. Most live in Ho Chi Minh City.  About 70 such children have been declared by the State Department to be United States citizens, able to pick up their passports at any consulate. Yet none of the 70, none of about 500 others whose American paternity has been established, and none who have appealed over the past two years to Vietnamese and American authorities, have actually left Vietnam."

The Federal Communications Commission, in a two-page order issued by its telecommunications committee, authorized the Chicago-based company to operate as a so-called resale common carrier throughout the continental United States.   The designation gives the giant manufacturing concern clearance to lease facilities from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and A.T.& T. competitors and then resell the interstate communications services to its own customers at a discount."
