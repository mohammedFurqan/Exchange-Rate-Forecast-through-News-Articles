A close alternative is the equity-income fund, which invests mainly in stocks paying high dividends.   In terms of risk, the two types of funds are about equal. While convertible funds own lower-quality securities, they do have steady income, and at worst the securities trade like regular bonds of comparable quality, maturity and coupon. While common stock is riskier than bonds, the equity-income funds tend to focus on the less-risky blue chip issues."

It should be noted, in all fairness, that these business people do not necessarily spend office hours reliving their carefree youth, but the slightest inquiry is rewarded with vivid, often musical, memories.    ""Greylock Camp under skies so blue,"" warbled James Gordon, a Houston businessman who spent three years at Greylock Camp for Boys in Massachusetts in the late 50's. In 1989, Mr. Gordon was part of a family group that sold its jewelry business to the Zale Corporation for $312 million. But never mind Zale; Mr. Gordon is far more interested in explaining how the Red and Gray Teams competed in the Greylock Olympics. ""Now that was a big thing,"" he said."

After gliding through the tough terrain of business conditions in 1990 with record earnings, PPG saw its profits sag. By the fourth quarter of last year, the company's earnings plunged 42 percent from their level a year earlier and earnings for the entire year dropped to their lowest level since 1983.   But PPG's fortunes seem to have shifted, several industry analysts say, contending that the company already absorbed the biggest blow from the recession, in the last three months of 1991. In part, the improvement is the result of greater efficiency and the closing of high-cost operations, notably in glass making. But the greatest benefit has come from the slow, but steady improvement in the economy, which has increased the demand for automobiles, houses and office buildings that use the company's glass for windows."

After candidates make their representations and promises, after they cash the checks, their backers can only guess at whether their investments will pay off. If campaign investors are serious about getting their money's worth, they need forecasts of the likelihood that politicians will repay their debts. Contributors should insist that Moody's and Standard & Poor's analyze and rate the candidates just as they do any other public offering.  Plenty of organizations and special-interest groups already rate politicians. But America needs independent, nonpartisan ratings that can provide more than ideological scorecards: a rating system that can assess the real worth of a candidate's commitments. No more guesswork. Campaign investors should be able to assemble portfolios of creditworthy candidates."

Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares, which trade on stock exchanges like common shares, often at a premium or discount to the value of the funds' holdings.   The growth in closed-end funds that buy tax-free municipal bonds results in part from falling interest rates, which have pushed investors out of money market funds, and in part from rising effective tax rates. Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds can leverage their portfolios by selling very-short-term preferred stock, using the proceeds to increase the yield for common stockholders."

The plan, which is being prepared with advice from officials at the International Atomic Energy Agency here, would provide for refitting of some reactors with more modern safety features, the closing down of those considered too unsafe to be worth saving and the provision of alternative sources of electricity, including supplies from Western Europe, according to diplomats and agency officials here.

But he insisted that his federal Yugoslav Government was neither involved in nor abetting the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In a report released this morning, the United States was described as having the most unfair trade among the world's industrialized nations. An official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the underlying aim of the council's report was to provide a blueprint for Japan's new strategy for handling trade disputes -- trying to move away from the past practice of negotiating directly with the United States over trade problems and instead referring them to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world organization that oversees trade. 'The Basis for Discussions'     ""The intention is to use GATT frequently,"" the official said. ""This report will be a guideline for our approach to solving trade problems, the basis for discussions with our major trading partners.""   Whether the full Japanese Government adopts this policy as a vigorous new approach, and how successful it might be, remain to be seen. However much Japan may prefer the multinational arena, it is likely to be forced to deal with Washington directly when members of Congress, the Administration or prominent American industries have major complaints.    But such a shift could have a big impact on Japan's often bitter relationship with its largest trading partner.   In Washington, Kathleen A. Lydon, the assistant United States trade representative for public affairs, said the United States believed that resolving trade disputes through GATT was ""one of the best"" approaches to take.    In its report, a subcommittee of the Industrial Sector Council, a private-sector advisory group to the trade ministry at the heart of Japanese policy-making, examined how closely Japan's trading partners adhered to rules governing international trade. It concluded that the United States failed in 9 of 10 areas.    The report accused the United States of these unfair trade practices:   *Washington too often imposes unilateral solutions on trade problems, instead of seeking to settle matters through international forums.   *The United States abuses rules that permit a country to halt the sale of other nations' products at prices below cost or below fair market value, a practice known as dumping.   *The United States arbitrarily alters tariffs and frequently resorts to negotiating ""voluntary"" restraints on another nation's exports, as it did with Japan on autos, steel and machine tools.   *""Buy American"" laws, some of which were enacted after President Bush's trip to Japan in January, restrict Federal Government purchases to mostly American goods and services and discriminate against Japanese products. American trade officials have frequently made this complaint about Japan.   Ms. Lydon said she had not seen the report and could not respond to its specific complaints but added, ""Everybody knows that the United States has the most open markets in the world, and our interest is in seeing that other nations follow suit.""   As for the criticism of voluntary restraint agreements, she said, ""We would much prefer to see them open their markets than to manage the number of items they export.""   The report ranked the European Community next to last among Japan's trading partners, failing in six categories. Hong Kong and Singapore were cited as the fairest traders. Other countries examined were Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand.   The document comes as Japan is under pressure from a number of countries over its trade practices. Although Japan's trade surplus with the United States appears to have stabilized at about $40 billion a year, its surplus with Asia and the European Community has been rising sharply. Japan's overall surplus this year is expected to be more than $110 billion, the largest in the world.   Japan feels the GATT rules offer it a better forum, since they give far less weight to trade imbalances by themselves. The report dismissed such imbalances as meaningless.   ""Although some point to Japan's large trade surplus as evidence of a closed market, this argument is refuted by basic lessons of economics,"" it insisted.   The United States conducts an annual trade survey in which it judges how open the markets of its trading partners are. Japanese officials said Tokyo's unfairness report would also be an annual exercise from now on.   Japan is negotiating with South Korea over the large Japanese trade surplus with Korea, and Japan's surplus with the European Community was a record $27.4 billion last year, a 48 percent increase from 1990. It appears likely to grow this year.   Nonetheless, Japan was angered when the European Community recently expressed its disappointment at the growing size of the trade gap. The Europeans issued a formal review of their relations with Japan that emphasized the trade problems.   That prompted the Japanese Government to say it was sending a tough letter in reply, expressing its unhappiness that the community chose to emphasize trade over political and other areas where Japan believes relations have improved.   The new report said it had three objectives. The first was to come up with a new definition of unfair trade, largely by referring to GATT rules. But it excluded trade in agricultural goods, an area in which Japan is often criticized because of its ban on the import of rice.   The second objective was to suggest that all countries deviated from the GATT rules to some extent.   And last, the report was an attempt to move away from direct discussions between countries for resolving trade disputes and toward taking them to GATT instead."

It reflects the presence of a new majority, more skeptical of industry claims, on the little-known body, which has the power to block American industries from receiving Commerce Department protection from imports. A Former Member's Analysis    Three new commissioners -- two Republicans and a Democrat -- have joined the six-member body in recent months, and the two Republicans appear to be taking a much narrower interpretation of the nation's trade law than their predecessors.

Sales of American goods in Japan dropped 18.1 percent from March, while sales to Western Europe tumbled 13.6 percent."

The product, which is actually a data base spreadsheet program, makes life easier for financial analysts who must combine scores of spreadsheets sent to the home office. The usual practice for consolidating all the numbers is to create a master sheet with a program like Excel or 1-2-3 and electronically cut and paste all the pieces together. Another approach is to link the spreadsheets.    Both methods are time consuming and allow the data to be viewed only from a set of predetermined assumptions. If those assumptions change, an entirely new spreadsheet must be constructed. For example, if the master spreadsheet is set up to view a company's sales numbers by division, the branch office numbers might not be broken out. To see them, a new spreadsheet would have to be created."

But in 1986, the Reagan Administration muscled into place a policy calling for ""drug-free"" Federal work places, including a clause that mandated drug testing for some workers. In itself, that action might have had little impact on anyone except employees periodically required to hand over a beaker of urine. But the executive order led to the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, which required companies with Federal contracts to establish drug policies and make ""good faith"" efforts to maintain a drug-free work place.   That    did    have an impact, not only on companies with Federal ties but on ones that want them in the future. One result, according to a report released this month by the American Management Association, is a vast expansion of drug-testing among its members, 7,000 medium- to large-sized firms representing some 25 percent of the American work force. According to the report, three-quarters of the 1,200 companies responding to the A.M.A.'s questionnaire now test for controlled and illegal substances -- which is to say, not alcohol. That is an 18 percent jump over last year and a 250 percent pole vault over the baseline numbers the group reported for 1987, the first year it surveyed work place testing policies."

But in fact, electronics have permeated every corner of the publishing business, from the newsroom of this newspaper to the offices of all but the tiniest newsletters.  Paper won't disappear, but paperless media will soak up ever more of our time. We will eventually become paperless the same way we once became horseless.

Olympia & York is the biggest company ever to file for bankruptcy protection in Canada. Analysts and bankers have long expressed a fear that if the company was forced to file for bankruptcy, the world's financial and property markets would be roiled.

Could Hurt Banks    Office rents, building prices and bank balance sheets in the United States already reflect such a weak property market that Olympia & York's bankruptcy filing is unlikely to cause much further harm, real estate and banking experts said yesterday. In New York, the company's most prominent property is the World Financial Center on the southern tip of Manhattan. But the financial problems could have an impact on some major banks in Europe, Canada and Japan as well as some New York banks, including Citicorp, J. P. Morgan & Company and Chemical Bank.

A raging debate here over whether racial discrimination was at play in the sport's seeming reluctance to promote a non-Japanese to sumo's highest ranks came to an anticlimactic end when Konishiki, after a promising start, lost four consecutive matches.

But why should safe, healthy banks -- or really their customers, employees and stockholders -- have to absorb these costs? Congress's feverish but probably futile desire to avoid having taxpayers bear these costs is only part of the explanation.  The Government's willingness to pile extra costs on banks reflects the widely held view that banks are powerful and rich monopolies, with the deepest of deep pockets. Shaped by populist perceptions of a century ago, this view still influences public policy. Banks are often treated as regulated public utilities, with the same obligations to serve their communities as power and phone companies."

She had sewn all of her stock certificates into the hems of her draperies. Worse yet, she had begun confiding her secret to the most casual acquaintances. But the minister did not call the woman's children. And he did not suggest that she be admitted to a nursing home where she would be ""safe.""  Instead, he called Dee Lee, a financial planner in Harvard who specializes in services for the elderly, to see what could be done to keep the woman at home and independent. Ms. Lee met with the woman several times and finally persuaded her to turn over the stock -- a half million dollars worth -- to a brokerage firm for safe keeping. Today, at 86, the woman is still living at home."

The United States banned tuna imports last year from Mexico, Venezuela and Vanuatu -- an island group in the southwest Pacific formerly known as the New Hebrides -- because their tuna boats were killing more dolphins than American boats were.

Sometimes new-car owners are offered double the amount they paid minutes before to the dealer.   Clearly, the free market has come to car sales in Russia today, but in a form not easily recognizable in the United States. In the United States, the supply of new cars is more than the American public will buy, so a new car's value begins to fall the minute it leaves the dealer's lot. Here, the Government has allowed dealers to raise new car prices twentyfold since Jan. 1.

In a widely watched experiment at the Long Island Lighting Company's oil-fired generating station here, engineers think they have found a cost-effective way to take nitrogen oxides out of power plant emissions.   Historically, utilities have not focused on nitrogen oxides. They have had their hands full with two other pollution problems: sulfur dioxide, the prime cause of acid rain, and particulates, or soot. But, acting under provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990, New York, New Jersey and the six New England states recently agreed to strict new standards on nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants."

The large number of short-sellers who were betting against the aerospace company started bailing out, in some cases with big losses. But they jumped too quickly.   For the last few months, McDonnell Douglas's shares have been diving faster than an F-15, and they continued downward yesterday. They closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $39.125, down $1.625 on the day. The price has declined $20 a share in a month, and since last fall has lost more than half its market value.   The decline has been so sharp that McDonnell Douglas, which is based in St. Louis, is considering stepping in to start buying shares itself. Herbert J. Lanese, the company's chief financial officer, said in an interview yesterday that with the stock trading at 35 percent of its book value a share buyback would make sense. He declined to say how many shares the company might purchase or at what prices.   ""We've got some cash,"" Mr. Lanese said. ""We're considering going into the market for some of our own shares.""   Mr. Lanese said the loss of investor confidence had been exaggerated by thin trading. Of McDonnell Douglas's 39 million shares, about half are owned by employee stock plans or McDonnell family trusts. As a result, only 18 million shares or so are available for active trading, and Mr. Lanese said any active buying or selling had an outsized effect on the price.   But to many investors, the problems extend well beyond liquidity. For starters there is the growing uncertainty over McDonnell Douglas's chances of cobbling together a deal, announced with great fanfare in November, to sell up to 40 percent of its commercial aircraft business for $2 billion to a nascent aerospace company in Taiwan.   There are also nagging concerns about the ability of the company to control cost overruns on its largest Pentagon contract, the C-17 transport plane, and head off mounting Congressional opposition to the program. If those problems are not enough, the company is being battered by the depressed worldwide market for jetliners, a result of the hard times being suffered by airlines.   Apparently disenchanted by McDonnell Douglas's continuing troubles, one of its largest institutional shareholders, the Magellan Fund, started selling big chunks of the stock in the middle of May, including a 500,000-share block on May 14, traders said. Seeing profit in the downward spiral, short-sellers have surged back in recent weeks. Mr. Lanese said short interest in the stock might now be as high as 3.5 million shares, up from 3.2 million on May 15 and just over 2 million as recently as February.   The eroding confidence among investors has also extended to their faith in John McDonnell, the chairman and chief executive.   ""From the outside looking in, it looks like they haven't made enough of a change in the corporate culture and enough of a change in the way they make decisions to give people confidence in the company's prospects,"" said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence in New York. ""There's a management core there that's excellent, but they're also being burdened by what I would call a less decisive c.e.o. than is appropriate.""   The losses suffered by most airlines and the end of the cold war have made for a tumultuous time for all military contractors and aerospace companies. In McDonnell's case, much of the uncertainty centers on the proposed deal with Taiwan Aerospace, which appears to be collapsing. Without the $2 billion that deal would provide, McDonnell Douglas will be unable to afford to develop a planned jumbo jetliner, the MD-12. And without the MD-12, McDonnell Douglas will be unable to remain competitive with its rivals in commercial aircraft, the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium.   The question now is whether McDonnell Douglas's share price is bottoming out, creating a buying opportunity.   ""Not yet,"" said Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago. ""It's possible there could continue to be some slippage from these levels, not because of changed fundamentals but simply because of investor psychology.""   Mr. Rubel of C. J. Lawrence put it in even blunter terms: ""Their performance hasn't given me the confidence to stick my neck out to get people to buy the stock."""

Savoy actually made its proposal to rescue Orion several weeks ago. Orion and its creditors seemed at the time to be well on their way to finalizing a deal with another bidder, the New Line Cinema Corporation. But last week New Line broke off the negotiations, saying it could not make a deal on the terms being demanded by the creditors. That left Savoy with the only offer on the table.

Lofty as the value is, the figure declined $25 million in 12 months. Many franchises showed a similar pattern, a symptom of soaring player costs and uncertainty over labor problems and how far television revenues will fall when future national contracts are negotiated.   According to the magazine, the total market value of the 102 pro baseball, football, basketball and hockey teams decreased 2.3 percent from a year ago. In 1991, it estimates that 23 teams lost money (largest operating loss: $11.4 million for the Milwaukee Brewers). While the 102 teams' revenues rose 16 percent last year to $4.3 billion, operating income fell 10 percent to an estimated $560 million.   The magazine found that salaries are racing ahead of revenues in major league baseball and the National Football League. In baseball, salaries spiked up 51 percent in 1991, outpacing a revenue gain of 12 percent. In the N.F.L., player costs jumped 29 percent, but revenues rose 12 percent.   Some teams are seeking to lift revenues by building new arenas or stadiums and erecting skyboxes, but the key variable on revenues is what will happen with the leagues' TV contracts. Declines in advertising and financial losses on major sports TV deals are likely to conspire to decrease the value of most leagues' future rights fees, and thus the value of the teams.   The magazine also revealed financial gamesmanship in the National Hockey League, where it contends that two sets of books exist in the league, one that shows an overall $1.2 million profit in 1990-91 because some revenues, including those from concessions and skyboxes, were excluded. Another set of numbers, which includes some in-arena numbers, shows a $46 million profit. Financial World's own figures show a $102 million profit."

The companies argue that they should get the extensions because the Food and Drug Administration has rendered their patents virtually worthless by taking so long to approve their products for sale."

Also today, American and European Community negotiators appeared to have settled a dispute over Government subsidies to their commercial aircraft industries. The two sides reached a tentative deal patching up differences that emerged after they reached a draft pact on March 31, but no details were available.    On the free-trade agreement, United States, Canadian and Mexican officials met throughout last week in Mexico City and produced considerable and unexpected progress on issues in many industries, notably textiles and automobiles, they said. But differences remain on such questions as the access of United States banks and oil drilling companies to the Mexican financial services and energy markets.   The faster pace of negotiations leaves Congressional approval of a deal this year still unlikely but not impossible. Less time remains on the Congressional calendar this year than called for by the ""fast track"" legislation for consideration of trade agreements. The Administration would thus have to persuade Congress not only to approve an agreement but to do so speedily.   The proposed North American trade pact would broaden an existing free-trade agreement struck in 1988 between the United States and Canada."

Bernard Tapie, who owns the Adidas sporting goods company as well as France's top soccer club, said he was stepping down as Urban Affairs Minister to dedicate himself entirely to proving his innocence. He said he was the victim of a ""political plot"" and of ""manipulation"" of the judicial system."

For if the guerrilla leader Charles Taylor has his way, this remote outpost will become the strategic center of a vast military and administrative empire.   Already nearly 95 percent of Liberia, the West African nation founded by freed American slaves, is in effect run from Gbarnga by Mr. Taylor's forces. The area has its own currency and banking system, an international airfield, a thriving export trade in diamonds, gold, rubber and timber -- even its own radio and television network."

The Saudi warning, in letters to the companies, implied that they were operating without permission in Saudi territory. But industry executives said many of the operations are on land and in Red Sea offshore waters that have been under Yemeni control for years."

Since 1990, Ms. Bergen has been the exclusive spokeswoman for Sprint in a series of irreverent television commercials, the centerpiece of Sprint's spirited battle to lure long-distance telephone customers from its two larger rivals, A.T.& T. and MCI."

They say the format could invigorate the fortunes of Tandy, best known now for its Radio Shack stores, and pin back the ears of some competitors.   After effortlessly riding the growth of VCR's and compact-disk players in the 1980's, consumer electronics retailers have more recently had to fight for their share of a flat market. Given this period of ""maturation and saturation,"" as one analyst called it, those who follow the industry are seldom roused to feel much more than indifference about the retailers' stocks."

But workers and their families suffer, too, often having to wait years to see results, while financial and emotional reserves drain away. Many cases are ultimately abandoned, not on their merits, but because they no longer promise sufficient compensation to plaintiffs' lawyers.

The excerpt indicates Lenin's desire to rid the country of any potential political opponents.                         July 17, 1922       Comrade Stalin!   On the matter of deporting Mensheviks, National Socialists, Kadets, etc. from Russia, I would like to ask a few questions, since this operation, which was started before my leave, still has not been completed.   Has the decision been made to ""eradicate"" all the NS's? Peshekhonov, Myakotin, Gornfeld, Petrishchev, et al.?    As far as I'm concerned, deport them all.  [ They are ]  more harmful than any SR  [ Socialist Revolutionary ]  -- because  [ they are ]  more clever.   Also A. N. Potresov, Izgoyev and all the ""Ekonomist"" contributors (Ozerov and many, many others). The Mensheviks, Rozanov (a physician, cunning), Vigdorchik, (Migulov or something like that), Liubov Nikolayevna Radchenko and her young daughter (rumor has it they're the vilest enemies of Bolshevism), N. A. Rozhkov (he has to be deported; incorrigible); S. A. Frank (author of ""Metodologiya""). The commission supervised by Mantsev, Messing, et al. should present lists and several hundred such ladies and gentlemen must be deported without mercy. Let's purge Russia for a long while!                    . . .         This must be done at once. Before the end of the SRs' trial, no later. Arrest a few hundred and without a declaration of motives -- get out, ladies and gentlemen! . . .    With a communist greeting, -- LENIN  WARNING ABOUT FAMINE IN SIBERIA      A confidential      report in April 1932 illustrated the devastating effects of farm collectivization in Siberia. At the time, the Soviet authorities went to great lengths to keep the widespread famine secret from the outside world. The following is from a physician's report sent to Grigory K. Ordzhonikidze, a confidant of Stalin.   Filipp Borodin has earned 650 work-days, has a wife and 5 children ranging from one and a half to nine years of age. The wife lies ill on the oven, 3 children sit on the oven; they are as pale as wax with swollen faces. . . . Filipp Borodin himself sits on a bench and continuously smokes cigarettes made of repulsively pungent tobacco, cries like a babe, asks death for his children.    In tears he asks Comrade Sukhanov: ""Give us at least one kilo of potatoes, give us at least one liter of milk, after all, I worked all summer and even now I work unceasingly. . . . According to the statement by Comrade Sukhanov and the brigadier of the kolkhoz ""Red Partisan,"" Borodin was a noncomplaining worker.   Borodin does not even have food substitutes for nourishment; two days ago he and his family ate two sickly piglets thrown out of the common farmyard. In the Borodin home there is unbelievable filth, dampness, and stench, mixed with the smell of tobacco. Borodin swears at the children: ""The devils don't die. I wish I didn't have to look at you!"" Having objectively investigated the condition of Borodin himself, I ascertain that he (Borodin) is starting to slip into psychosis due to starvation, which can lead to his eating his own children. . . . March 25, 1932 Regional Health Inspector Dr. KISELEV  BUKHARIN PROCLAIMS INNOCENCE    Nikolai V. Bukharin, a leading Bolshevik theorist and a friend as well as a frequent intellectual opponent of Lenin, led the so-called ""right opposition"" to Stalin in 1928-29 and was perhaps the most prominent victim of his purges. Here is his protestation of innocence in a February 1937 letter to Soviet leaders just before his arrest, and his plea for mercy after his conviction in a show trial on March 13, 1938, the presumed day of his execution.                         February 20, 1937       Dear Comrades!   I have sent to the Plenum of the Central Committee a two-part ""Deposition"" of nearly 100 pages, responding to the cloud of slander contained in the testimony. . . .    As a result of all this, I am a nervous wreck. The death of Sergo  [ Ordzhonikidze ] , whom I loved as deeply as a member of my family, was the final blow. The position in which this slander has put me, when I can neither rejoice together with my Party comrades, together with the whole country (Pushkin Days), nor grieve and mourn over the body of Sergo is an insufferable position and I cannot endure it any more.   I swear to you once again on the last breath of Ilich  [ Lenin ] , who died in my arms; on my deep love for Sergo, and on all that I hold sacred that associating me with all these acts of terrorism, sabotage, Trotskyite pacts, etc. is unheard-of base slander.                     . . .         In this most extraordinary situation, from tomorrow I will go on a full hunger strike until the charges of treason, sabotage and terrorism against me are removed. I will not live with these accusations. . . . Farewell.  Be victorious.  Yours,  N. BUKHARIN  A Plea for Mercy    I beg the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. for mercy. I consider the verdict of the court to be just punishment for my most grave transgressions against the socialist motherland, its people, party, and government. There is not a single word of protest in my soul. I should be shot ten times for my crimes. . . .    If I allow myself to petition the highest government organ in our land, before which I appear on my knees, it is only because I believe that through a pardon I can be of value to my country; I do not say -- and I am not able to say -- that I can expiate my guilt; the crimes I committed are so monstrous, so enormous, that I cannot atone for the guilt -- no matter what I may do for the rest of my life. But I assure the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet that my stay of more than a year in prison has forced me to do a great deal of thinking and to reconsider much from my criminal past. . . .    Step by step, I have re-examined my past life. The former Bukharin has already died; he no longer lives on this earth.                     . . .         Let a new, second Bukharin grow -- let him even be  [ called ]  Petrov -- this new man will be the complete antithesis of the one who has died. He has already been born -- give him the opportunity of any kind of work at all. . . . I shall strive to prove to you, with every fiber of my being, that this gesture of proletarian generosity was justified.  Nikolai Bukharin. Moscow, March 13, 1938. Internal N.K.V.D. prison. ANDROPOV NAMES HIS ENEMIES      A memorandum written by the head of the K.G.B., Yuri V. Andropov, on Nov. 15, 1976, gives details on the activities of leading dissidents and steps taken against them. Mr. Andropov later succeeded Leonid I. Brezhnev as Soviet leader, holding power from 1982 until his death in February 1984.      In recent years our adversary's special services and propaganda bureaus have attempted to give the impression that a so-called ""internal opposition"" exists in the U.S.S.R., rendering support to those who inspire antisocial and anti-Soviet activities and promote the banding together of participants in a variety of anti-Soviet activities.   Accordingly, in 1969 antisocial elements headed by Yakir and Krasin founded an ""initiative group"" in order to form an organization made up of participants of the so-called ""movement for democratization.""   In 1970, in order to activate the antisocial efforts of individuals with hostile leanings, Chalidze established the so-called ""Committee for the Protection of Human Rights"" which, in addition to himself, includes among its members Academician Sakharov and Shafarevich, a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.   In 1973 the so-called ""Russian Section"" of Amnesty International, headed by Turchin and Tverdokhlebov, assumed organizational responsibilities for individuals with anti-Soviet leanings.                     . . .         As a result of measures taken by the Committee for State Security, the ""initiative group"" and the ""Committee for the Protection of Human Rights"" have been completely compromised and have virtually ceased to exist. The activities of the ""Russian Section"" have been curtailed.   Nevertheless, despite the failure to create an ""internal opposition"" in the U.S.S.R., our adversary has not abandoned this idea.   On May 12 of this year, on the initiative of Yuri F. Orlov, born in 1924, unemployed, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian S.S.R., the antisocial elements announced the formation of a ""Group for Implementation of the Helsinki Accords in the U.S.S.R.""   This ""group"" includes the following individuals: Ginzburg, A. I., has on numerous occasions been brought to criminal accountability, born 1936, Jew, unemployed; Grigorenko, P. G., born 1907, Ukrainian, retiree; the professional criminal Marchenko, A. T., born 1938, Russian, in exile in Irkutsk Oblast;  [ also ]  the Jewish extremists: Rubin, V. A., born 1913, Jew, emigrated to Israel; Shcharansky, A. D., born 1948, Jew, unemployed; and Slepak, V. S., born 1927, Jew, unemployed;  [ also ]  participants in various hostile activities: Sakharov's wife Bonner, Ye. G., born 1922, Jew, retiree; Bernshtam, M. S., born 1949, Jew, emigrated to Israel; Landa, M. N., born 1918, Jew, retiree, unemployed; Alekseyeva, L. M., born 1927, Russian, unemployed, and Korchak, A. A., born 1922, Ukrainian, fellow at the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Transmission, Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.                    . . .         The Committee for State Security is taking measures to compromise and put an end to the ""group's"" hostile activities.   Reported by way of information. Chairman of the Committee on State Security  ANDROPOV  K.G.B. WARNING ON CHERNOBYL      More than seven years before the Cherno     byl nuclear disaster, the K.G.B., led by An     dropov, had reported to the Central Committee of the Soviet Union that there were serious design and construction problems at the power station.                         February 21, 1979         According to data in the possession of the K.G.B. of the U.S.S.R., design deviations and violations of construction and assembly technology are occurring at various places in the construction of the second generating unit of the Chernobyl A.E.S. and these could lead to mishaps and accidents.   The structural pillars of the generator room were erected with a deviation of up to 100 mm. from the reference axes, and horizontal connections between the pillars are absent in places.    Wall panels have been installed with a deviation of up to 150 mm. from the axes. The placement of roof plates does not conform to the designer's specifications. Crane tracks and stopways have vertical drops of up to 100 mm. and in places a slope of up to 8  .   Deputy head of the Construction Directorate, Comrade V. T. Gora, gave instructions for backfilling the foundation in many places where vertical waterproofing was damaged. Similar violations were permitted in other sections with the knowledge of Comrade V. T. Gora and the head of the construction group, Comrade Yu. L. Matveyev. Damage to the waterproofing can lead to ground water seepage into the station and radioactive contamination of the environment.   The leadership of the Directorate is not devoting proper attention to the foundation, on which the quality of the construction largely depends."

It's Now: 'Will It Play in Tulsa?',"  Blame it on the musical ""Oklahoma!,"" John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath"" and the oil business. The nation's image of Tulsa, complains Rusty Linker of the Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce, remains one of amiable cowpokes, oil rigs and parched plains.   It scarcely seems fair. Tulsa, with a population of 367,000, is a tree-lined city with twice the average rainfall of San Francisco. The local economy is more dependent on high-technology services like the computer center that handles reservations for American Airlines than on oil. The only cowboys in town are the dress-up urban variety."

But company officials and some analysts noted yesterday that the timing was largely coincidental. The genesis of the deal goes back to 1987, when Aetna decided to explore the sale of its reinsurance unit for two reasons, said Edward B. Jobe, president and chief executive officer of the American Re-Insurance Company, who will continue to run the company after the sale to Kohlberg, Kravis, which will rename the company the American Re Corporation."

To be sure, no one here knew they were missing it.

The formal tasting took place at the Exhibition of National Economic Achievements, a centerpiece of gilded fountains, giant airships and other monuments of the Soviet era. The first verdict by a troupe from the Moscow Children's Theater was that peanut butter -- or arakhisovoye maslo -- was ""on the salty side."" No one complained about it sticking to the roof of his mouth."

Actuaries who evaluate this option, however, nearly always dismiss it as inferior to coverage under the pension plan itself.  Here's how it works: When an employee retires, he or she generally has several options for receiving pension income. For example, the retiree can elect a single annuity, which would pay income only for his or her lifetime, or a ""joint and survivor"" annuity, which would pay less initially but continue the benefit for the lifetime of the spouse. The spouse might receive 100 percent of the reduced benefit, 75 percent or 50 percent."

He was 74 years old.

Conner had already co-founded two successful disk drive companies and retired as a wealthy man when an engineer approached him in 1985 with a new drive design and a business plan.

Like the scheduled welcome of Russia and the other former Soviet republics into the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on Monday, the trans-Atlantic jousting threatens to detract attention from the international lending institutions' traditional clients in the third world. Planning sessions for the lending institutions' semiannual conference have given little attention to the new problems of the poor countries, such as the drought in Africa, or to their new economic growth. After years of following the stiff prescriptions of the World Bank and the I.M.F., dozens of them are buying more Western exports."

In an article being published Wednesday on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, the specialist, Scott Ritter, a former Marine Corps captain who is a ballistic-missile analyst with the United Nations commission charged with supervising the destruction of Iraq's weaponry, is quoted as saying, ""No mobile Scud launchers were destroyed during the war."""

Lowers Its Rating On UAL and United Air Debt,"  The Standard & Poor's Corporation announced yesterday that it had lowered the rating on about $2.9 billion of debt issued by the UAL Corporation and its United Air Lines Inc. subsidiary, placing the rating just above the level of junk bonds and making borrowing more expensive for UAL.    But the decision by S.& P. to cut the ratings to BBB-, the agency's lowest investment-grade rating, barely rippled prices of the company's bonds yesterday."

The orthodoxy is embodied in his new Prime Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, who personifies the great shift of French Socialism over the last decade from statist interventionism to free-market efficiency and monetarist discipline."

Possibly the most worrisome is whether the assassination was linked to his inquiries into a new and largely unchronicled drive by the Sicilian Mafia and Colombian drug dealers to flood Europe with cocaine and thus expand beyond what narcotics agents call the saturated market of the United States.    Initially, the slaying of the Mafia investigator, Giovanni Falcone, on a highway outside Palermo was attributed to a vendetta against him for bringing over 300 mafiosi to justice in the 1980's, and many still see this as the prime motive. Another goal was assumed to be preventing Mr. Falcone from taking a new job at the head of an anti-Mafia superagency this year."

Hans Blix, the director general of the agency, just returned from a six-day visit to North Korea. He is the first Westerner known to have visited the sprawling laboratory in Yongbyon, 60 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang. The laboratory is the focus of suspicions about North Korea's nuclear intentions. A Network of Tunnels    The observations of Mr. Blix, who also saw three nuclear power plants and a surprising network of underground tunnels, provide the firmest evidence yet that North Korea may have tried to build a nuclear bomb, or perhaps is still trying. He said his inspection would be followed within a few weeks by a team that will examine all of North Korea's declared nuclear sites."

Diplomats said that the new measure was being drafted by the United States, Britain and France, and that while details were still being worked out, the first step would probably be a call to follow the United States example by cutting civilian air links by banning all flights by JAT, the Yugoslav national airline."

In 1988, when the junk market was strong, the yield spread between the two types of funds averaged about three percentage points. As the junk market began falling apart in late 1989 and 1990, yields on junk funds rose sharply, peaking at nearly seven percentage points more than high-quality corporate bond funds in late 1990. Because of the uncertain economy in early 1991, yields remained fairly high."
