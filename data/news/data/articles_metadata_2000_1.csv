The shares traded as high as $165, more than four times the offering price of $38, before retreating to slightly more than $95.

With more people entering the work force, the unemployment rate remained at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent, where it has been for the last three months.

Average hourly earnings for the month rose by 0.4 percent, slightly more than expected. But because workers are producing more for each hour worked, the growth in wages so far shows few signs of setting off a surge in inflation.
