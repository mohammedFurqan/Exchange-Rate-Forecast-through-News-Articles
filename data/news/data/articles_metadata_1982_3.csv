Kennedy as Ambassador at Large and special adviser on nuclear energy affairs and on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.   The appointment was also announced at the State Department by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who said the move reflected the priority he and President Reagan give to curbing the spread of nuclear weapons.   ''This subject is of such immense importance that we have to have somebody paying attention to it full time,'' Mr. Shultz said of the decision to fill the post, which has been vacant since Gerard C.  Smith resigned after President Carter was defeated."

The country's commodity-based economy is faltering, Australia is anxious to reduce aid to the former colony and relations are tense with Indonesia, which shares the border that divides the island of New Guinea.   The Parliament that returned Mr. Somare to office was elected after a particularly arduous process. Voters, most of whom are illiterate, took three weeks to cast ballots, many traveling to the polls on foot, through some of the world's most inhospitable jungles. When their candidates failed to win, there were several reports of selfmutilation, the traditional reaction to shame. At least six battles were reported fought with spears, axes and bows and arrows in the highlands."

The bill's chances of passage appear to be fading.   Nevertheless, the bill's principal author - Representative Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado - and his staff say they can probably get the bill through the committee in a week and onto the House floor before the end of August, despite the delaying tactics of the bill's opponents.   But there are several reasons why that may not happen and why Congress, after five years of trying, may again fail to adopt the first comprehensive rewriting of telephone legislation since 1934.  The reasons include these:   - The Reagan Administration (with William F. Baxter, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division, as its principal spokesman) has come out strongly against the bill in the last month. The Administration contends that the bill is, at best, unnecessary and that it may make harmful changes in the antitrust settlement that Mr. Baxter negotiated with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company last January. Under the settlement, A.T.& T. agreed to get rid of its 22 regional telephone companies."

REYNOLDS IN BIG JUMP,"  R.J. Reynolds Industries, the world's largest cigarette producer, yesterday reported second-quarter profits of $295 million, or $2.74 a share, the highest in its history and a 48.2 percent increase over the $199 million, or $1.82 a share, reported in the 1981 period.  Sales in the quarter were $3.12 billion, 5.1 percent higher than the $2.97 billion reported a year earlier.   Reynolds noted that current earnings were swollen by a $172.7 million cash award - 87 cents a share - received for oilfield properties originally owned by its Aminoil USA unit, after they were nationalized by Kuwait in 1978.   Operating profits excluding the award were $405 million, up a more modest 7.4 percent from $377 million in the 1981 quarter.  ''Reynolds escalated ad spending on tobacco and Del Monte, which penalized earnings by $17 million, or 8 cents a share after taxes,'' said Diana K. Temple, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. ''If you added the 8 cents to operating earnings'' of $1.87 a share, she continued, operating income would be $1.95 a share, ''or about what I expected.''"

On Computer Ban,"  A Washington-based company that wanted to supply computers made by Hitachi Ltd. to the Federal Bureau of Investigation said yesterday that it was planning to sue the bureau for illegally denying it a contract.   In a case that has raised eyebrows in the computer industry, the F.B.I. last month announced that it would not award a contract to the Vion Corporation, the lowest bidder, because the Hitachi computers included in the bid contained technology stolen from the International Business Machines Corporation.   The F.B.I. contract went instead to I.B.M., which had bid $17.1 million, about $1 million more than Vion's price. Reasons Called Political   Vion asserts that the contract was for equipment already on the market and therefore did not contain technology that Hitachi has recently been accused of stealing. The company charges that the F.B.I. denied it the contract for political reasons and to avoid embarrassment."

The question is particularly important for the c ustomers of credit unions and savings and loan associations, some ofw hich have millions of dollars of uninsured deposits in the n owdefunct Oklahoma City bank.   Credit union involvement has been particularly widespread. A total of 132 federally insured credit unions have $104 million of uninsured deposits in Penn Square. (Uninsured deposits are balances in excess of $100,000.) There are eight credit unions in New York State alone that have almost $10 million of such deposits. Based on the current assessment of the Penn Square situation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, each depositor, including the big institutions, should get 80 cents on each dollar, but it may take several years. Meanwhile, the deposits are earning no interest.   As far as Federal regulators know, none of the institutions with uninsured deposits in the bank have formally notified their depositors of the loss. Commercial banks and savings and loan associations are not required to do so, while credit unions need only make such disclosures in a footnote to their monthly financial statements, which are posted on the bulletin boards at the credit union offices. The footnote would indicate that the credit union suffered an investment loss, but would probably not mention Penn Square by name."

At the same time, Mr. Brezhnev appeared to be signaling that, in return for accepting what would amount to a defeat for the Sovietarmed Palestinians, the Soviet leadership expected the United States to drop plans for marines to participate in the operation.   Mr. Brezhnev's remarks, in the form of replies to questions put by the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, are to be published in the Wednesday issue and were circulated tonight by Tass, the Soviet Government's press agency."

The Administration insisted anew today that there had been no change in the continuing American refusal to have any direct contacts with the Palestinian group until it meets the American conditions first stated in 1975: Namely, that it recognize the right of Israel to exist and accept United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 of 1967 and 338 of 1973."

But many others said the Fed would tolerate the large increase, at least until it determines whether or not there will be large declines in following weeks."

While the officials expected to lead the new Government have sketched their economic views only in broad strokes, and talks between Christian Democrats and Free Democrats to forge a coalition platform as partners in the new Government do not begin until Monday, there are numerous indications that Germany's new leaders will bring about broad shifts in both the tone and content of Bonn's economic policy, bringing it closer to the conservative policies of Britain and the United States.   But despite a certain rapprochement, certain substantive differences are expected to remain. And the potential for continued conflicts with Washington over issues ranging from the Siberian gas pipeline to steel or agricultural trade problems will likely persist."

The takeover of Rouge Steel, the nation's eighth-largest steel company, would represent the first major investment by a large Japanese steelmaker in the United States.   The sprawling, 1,200-acre River Rouge complex in Dearborn just southwest of Detroit is a legacy of the first Henry Ford, who decided in the 1920's to build a fully integrated operation, where raw materials go in one end and cars come out the other. It is the only one of its kind in the nation."

For the White House and its Republican allies in Congress, the deliberations promise to be even more painful and divisive than those that characterized the battle over the budget for the fiscal year 1983.   After two years of spending cuts that have caused friction between the Reagan White House and the Republican leadership of the Senate, the Government still faces the prospect of budget deficits well in excess of $100 billion a year - and the trend may be toward bigger deficits unless a sustained economic recovery starts soon.   But Mr. Reagan has promised a narrowing trend in deficits. He made that pledge last autumn when he was forced to acknowledge that he would be unable to make good on his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984. It was for the sake of reducing future deficits that the President sponsored the 1982 tax act, a $98 billion revenueraising measure that many members of his own party denounced as a violation of the President's commitment to tax relief."

The critics, who say that the office's activities have no parallel in any other pluralistic democracy, also contend that the five-yearold agency, the Canadian Unity Information Office, has functioned as a tax-supported information gathering agency for the ruling Liberal Party.   The Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau says the agency is a necessary response to separatist pressures in Quebec and elsewhere.   From the office here where he supervises a staff of 90, Daniel Gagnier, the director of the unity office, said that as long as political parties cling to separatist planks in their platforms ''there remains a clear threat to national unity.'' He added that his office was concerned with both parrying regionalism and with forging and stimulating a sense of national consciousness."

The problem is pressing. A. Haeworth Robertson, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration until 1978, wrote in ''The Coming Revolution in Social Security'' last year of the agency's $43,000 unfunded liability for every adult between the ages of 20 and 65.   Few believe benefits can or should be cut enough to protect the fund in the years ahead. The obvious method of providing the necessary money is to use securities in the portfolio with higher yields over time, Robert C. Perez concludes."

While Israeli ground troops blocked almost all traffic into west Beirut, Israeli tanks entrenched in the hillside village of Hadath, overlooking the capital, fired at building and apartment complexes in the Palestinian neighborhoods of Lailake and Burj al-Brajneh.   Reporters who watched the Israeli bombardment said the return fire from the guerrillas hidden inside was sporadic.  The intensified Israeli pressure on west Beirut, where about 6,000 Palestinian guerrillas are trapped along with 500,000 civilians, came as the Israeli Government rejected a formal offer by the P.L.O. to the Lebanese Government to transfer its headquarters and some of its fighters out of Lebanon. The offer was relayed to Israel by Philip C. Habib, the special American envoy."

Some of the questions focus on the fear that major military actions may occur over the next few weeks, before the evacuation is completed.   ''The danger potential of the next few weeks cannot be underestimated,'' a Western diplomat said here today as he noted that the potentially fragile withdrawal plan devised by the special United States envoy, Philip C. Habib, could fall apart for any number of reasons.   In Egyptian circles there is a commitment to the policy of President Hosni Mubarak to press the United States into accepting a new approach toward the Palestinians, specifically trying to move the Reagan Administration toward accepting the idea of Palestinian self-determination."

The discussions followed talks in Washington in June between Mr.  Crocker and South African officials.

There were no immediate reports of disturbances in other cities.

''The Chapter 11 action might not have been necessary if the Government had accepted financial responsibility for its role in causing much of the disease,'' said John A. McKinney, chairman and chief executive officer.   Mr. McKinney has made it clear that Manville's strategy involved increasing pressure on the Government to push the growing asbestos compensation problem out of the courts and to help pay the claims of tens of thousands of workers who have sued the company and others in the industry. ''I expect to emerge from this, some system in which the Federal Government pays its share,'' he said.   Mr. McKinney's expectations, however, are not about to be realized soon. To start with, some of his basic assumptions are disputed by lawmakers. Some argue that Government is already paying its share, perhaps more, through workers' compensation, Medicaid and Social Security. Others say flatly that the Government is not to blame for the development of what medical experts have called the nation's worst occupational health disaster."

Habib, the special Middle East envoy, is being sent by President Reagan to Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and possibly other Arab countries to try to persuade them to accept the Palestine Liberation Organization forces in west Beirut as part of a solution to the Lebanon crisis.   Administration officials said the decision to have Mr. Habib leave Beirut for the weeklong mission, which will include a visit to Israel, was taken when it seemed that the Arabs were not moving quickly enough on working out a way for evacuating the Palestinian forces. It is feared that Israel will lose its patience and move its troops into west Beirut.   Today's Israeli attacks against Syrian and Palestinian positions in eastern Lebanon and west Beirut were regarded by officials as part of Israeli psychological pressure, meant to warn that force would be used, if necessary, to insure the withdrawal of the Palestinians."

Both Chase Manhattan and Continental invested in the energy boom with Penn Square Bank, a fast-growing Oklahoma City institution that was on the Government's ''problem bank'' list from 1980 until its sudden demise on July 5. Chase also channeled billions of dollars worth of government securities to Drysdale Government Securities Inc., a lilliputian-sized firm that collapsed with a resounding thud in May."

The most dramatic change, announced today, is the abolition of the post of party chairman, a post that became synonymous with Mao. The party will be headed by a general secretary, as in the Soviet Union.   The party leadership also plans to examine anew the qualifications of its nearly 40 million members to expel leftists who have resisted changes and to weed out others who are corrupt or incompetent."

By Burton Yale Pines.  348 pp. New York: William Morrow & Co. $13.50. By ALAN BRINKLEY   IN the heady days of the 1950's and the early 1960's, when American liberalism seemed securely enthroned, it was easy to dismiss the far right as the fading and obsolete remnant of a vanished past.  Its most prominent organizations, after all, were usually clumsy and embarrassing (witness the John Birch Society). Its leading publications were at best elegantly superficial (National Review) and at worst cranky and intemperate (Human Events). And its carping obsession with Communism was ill advised and politically crippling, for the liberals themselves had effectively pre-empted that issue. It did not seem presumptuous, therefore, when respected critics began to write smugly of the disappearance of a serious right, to celebrate what the historian Eric Goldman once called ''the arrival of a broad consensus in the thinking of Americans about the public issues of the day.''"

By normal considerations, Deere's dividend is threatened because Deere is paying out more than it is earning.   Earnings reported in the most recent quarter fell to a surprisingly low 4 cents a share, compared with estimates of 65 cents. Thus analysts pared their estimates for the year from $2.50."

To those questions, I see only one possible answer: none. If I am confirmed, agreements already executed by me will result in my resignation from my officerships in all Bechtel entities. I will retire as an employee, retaining only vested rights to medical and insurance benefits and to assets already accumulated under Bechtel trust and thrift plans."

Less than two weeks before its annual meeting, the company found out that Alan E. Clore, a British investor, was waging a proxy fight for control of the ailing mining and chemicals concern. Almost before Gulf Resources's top executives could catch their breath, they were ousted in one of the fastest proxy contests on record.   Mr. Clore's victory and its modest price tag of $1.5 million did not escape notice on Wall Street, where he captured the attention of many professionals and investors who rarely give faltering companies such as Gulf Resources a second glance. In short order, merger and acquisition specialists, along with disgruntled shareholders, began to wonder whether they, too, could take over a company with the expenditure of so little money and so little time.   Indeed, in the wake of the Gulf Resources contest, many Wall Street analysts expect a new wave of proxy fights, in which dissident investors, rather than trying to buy a company outright, will seek to wrest the reins from management by winning shareholder support for new corporate strategy."

After two days of preliminary strategy planning and briefings on bankruptcy law procedures here, the session was to continue in New York on Monday.   The preliminary conference, which ended today, was planned by the Barnwell, S.C., firm of Blatt & Sales so plaintiffs' lawyers could begin mapping a course of action to address what attorneys here called Manville's ''fraudulent'' bankruptcy petition.   Manville executives said when they filed last Thursday for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws that the cost of the 16,500 damage claims pending against the company could not be met and that the company's total liability could reach $2 billion. The effect of the filing has been to suspend the suits and avoid the filing of new ones."

SHAPIRO, ATTORNEY AT LAW","  IT has been more than a year since Irving S. Shapiro was chief executive of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, but executive habits die hard. A lawyer who became prominent in the business world by taking an active role in public policy issues, Mr. Shapiro - now a partner in the Wilmington office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom - is taking some of his business thinking back to the legal world.   ''You ought to run law firms the way you run a business,'' he contends, and to that end he has successfully urged Skadden, Arps to name a chief executive to handle long-range planning. The post, nothing new to the business world, is a rarity in the legal profession, which is only now, and slowly, beginning to adopt business practices. Skadden, Arps, particularly since Mr. Shapiro has come aboard, is in the vanguard of that movement.   The amiable and unassuming Mr. Shapiro has brought some other rather radical ideas to the 300-lawyer firm that has made its fame and fortune largely on senior partner Joseph E. Flom's aggressive mergers and acquisition practice. While the votes are not all in at Skadden, Arps, the partnership has expressed a willingness to at least think about Mr. Shapiro's ideas."

Given these razor-slim chances, Hollywood of late h as begun to churn out more new movies based on old hits than at any t ime in recent memory. Whether it is ''Jaws II,'' ''Rocky III,'' ' 'Psycho II'' or ''Airplane II,'' Hollywood hopes that when the dice r oll again, a sequel will better the odds.   Sequels are really a story of modern Hollywood economics. Even though this summer has set box office records, the sky-high cost of movie making has increased the penalty of a flop, breeding caution in an industry still reeling from such expensive failures as United Artists' $36 million ''Heaven's Gate.'' With today's films, on average, costing $11.3 million each to produce - and that's before the studio spends millions more for marketing and distribution - movie makers see sequels as a way to lure the public with bait it has swallowed before."

Streaking out of a clear afternoon sky, the Israeli jets scored three direct hits on what must have been a large ammunition cache buried behind Spinney's and only a few hundred yards from the Soviet Embassy. It continued to explode, shooting out rockets and bullets in all directions, for at least 90 minutes after the bombs hit. A column of gray smoke spiraled out of the exploding dump and hung over the southern suburbs for much of the afternoon."

Peking appears concerned that the abrupt resignation of Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Washington's preoccupation with the Lebanon crisis may be undercutting its efforts to get the Reagan Administration to end the delivery of aircraft and other weapons to Taiwan.   This unhappiness has become apparent in prominent articles in the Chinese press over the last week.  The Chinese leadership also seems worried that conservatives in the United States are exploiting the vacuum created by Mr. Haig's departure to revive support for the Nationalist regime on Taiwan.  Peking insists that Taiwan is a part of its territory and that the United States accepted this when it established diplomatic relations with China.

For 50 years, patients with advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis have had the option of being injected with a liquefied gold compound.   Now, the SmithKline Corporation appears close to introducing the first oral form of a gold compound for treating rheumatoid arthritis, the most serious form of arthritis. The drug ranks among the most anxiously awaited new medications to enter the advanced stages of Government review in recent years.   The reason for high hopes is that the drug, which SmithKline calls Ridaura, could greatly expand the use of gold treatments among the nation's five million rheumatoid arthritis patients. Many of these patients, a group that spans all age brackets but is largely composed of elderly people, have been unable to withstand the side effects of gold injections, which include nausea and other gastrointestinal problems that can be as debilitating as the disease itself. As a result, phyicians are reluctant to prescribe the treatment even among relatively young and robust patients. In almost all cases, gold injections are regarded as a drug of last resort."

The Government's forecast, which was issued after the markets closed Wednesday, also projected that the total wheat crop would be down only 1 percent from last season's record output; wheat futures closed steady after recovering from sharp early losses.   After studying the Government's projections, which were based on Aug. 1 farm conditions, grain brokers said the large surpluses can be attributed as much to higher per-acre yields as to the poor response of farmers to the Administration's acreage set-aside program. In the case of corn, excellent weather conditions increased the yield to 114 bushels per acre this season, an increase of 4 bushels over the previous record, set last year."

Instead of waiting until September to begin its television advertising for the new cameras, the company, the American marketing arm of the Japanese manufacturer, will begin its network TV advertising schedule on Thursday night.   In a pronounced switch from the company's previous advertising, for the higher priced AE-1 and A-1 models, the target audience for the new campaign will be women.   Each Snappy has a list price of more than $100, but both will almost certainly sell for less than that. At prices under $100, the new Canon units would be in competition with what the folks at Grey Advertising call ''snapshot cameras'' - an area now commanded by Kodak. Grey does the TV advertising while Dentsu, which is also the client's agency back in Japan, handles the print."

''When his face remained just as blank,'' he added, ' 'I decided he wasn't worth talking to.''  That exchange took place before ''Masquerade,'' by Kit Williams, hit the best-seller list in 1981, to rise to 400,000 copies in print. And before ''When Bad Things Happen to Good People'' by Rabbi Harold S. Kushner took its place on the list in Febraury with 300,000 copies in print. Now, the company is betting that lightning will strike a third time: with ''When The Wind Blows,'' a cartoon book about an old-fashioned English couple confronting nuclear annihilation.  Schocken, which primarily publishes Judaica, has startled others in the industry. For the privately held publishing house at the outer reaches of market visibility that gambles on books for their literary value - then turns them into blockbusters - stands out in an industry accustomed to costly flops."

The bill's chances of passage appear to be fading.   Nevertheless, the bill's principal author - Representative Timothy E.

But there are several reasons why that may not happen and why Congress, after five years of trying, may again fail to adopt the first comprehensive rewriting of telephone legislation since 1934.  The reasons include these:   - The Reagan Administration (with William F. Baxter, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division, as its principal spokesman) has come out strongly against the bill in the last month. The Administration contends that the bill is, at best, unnecessary and that it may make harmful changes in the antitrust settlement that Mr. Baxter negotiated with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company last January. Under the settlement, A.T.& T. agreed to get rid of its 22 regional telephone companies."

REYNOLDS IN BIG JUMP,"  R.J. Reynolds Industries, the world's largest cigarette producer, yesterday reported second-quarter profits of $295 million, or $2.74 a share, the highest in its history and a 48.2 percent increase over the $199 million, or $1.82 a share, reported in the 1981 period.  Sales in the quarter were $3.12 billion, 5.1 percent higher than the $2.97 billion reported a year earlier.   Reynolds noted that current earnings were swollen by a $172.7 million cash award - 87 cents a share - received for oilfield properties originally owned by its Aminoil USA unit, after they were nationalized by Kuwait in 1978.   Operating profits excluding the award were $405 million, up a more modest 7.4 percent from $377 million in the 1981 quarter.  ''Reynolds escalated ad spending on tobacco and Del Monte, which penalized earnings by $17 million, or 8 cents a share after taxes,'' said Diana K. Temple, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. ''If you added the 8 cents to operating earnings'' of $1.87 a share, she continued, operating income would be $1.95 a share, ''or about what I expected.''"

On Computer Ban,"  A Washington-based company that wanted to supply computers made by Hitachi Ltd. to the Federal Bureau of Investigation said yesterday that it was planning to sue the bureau for illegally denying it a contract.   In a case that has raised eyebrows in the computer industry, the F.B.I. last month announced that it would not award a contract to the Vion Corporation, the lowest bidder, because the Hitachi computers included in the bid contained technology stolen from the International Business Machines Corporation.   The F.B.I. contract went instead to I.B.M., which had bid $17.1 million, about $1 million more than Vion's price. Reasons Called Political   Vion asserts that the contract was for equipment already on the market and therefore did not contain technology that Hitachi has recently been accused of stealing. The company charges that the F.B.I. denied it the contract for political reasons and to avoid embarrassment."

The question is particularly important for the c ustomers of credit unions and savings and loan associations, some ofw hich have millions of dollars of uninsured deposits in the n owdefunct Oklahoma City bank.   Credit union involvement has been particularly widespread. A total of 132 federally insured credit unions have $104 million of uninsured deposits in Penn Square. (Uninsured deposits are balances in excess of $100,000.) There are eight credit unions in New York State alone that have almost $10 million of such deposits. Based on the current assessment of the Penn Square situation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, each depositor, including the big institutions, should get 80 cents on each dollar, but it may take several years. Meanwhile, the deposits are earning no interest.   As far as Federal regulators know, none of the institutions with uninsured deposits in the bank have formally notified their depositors of the loss. Commercial banks and savings and loan associations are not required to do so, while credit unions need only make such disclosures in a footnote to their monthly financial statements, which are posted on the bulletin boards at the credit union offices. The footnote would indicate that the credit union suffered an investment loss, but would probably not mention Penn Square by name."

The Syrian leader made this assertion in a speech Sunday night at a gathering of the country's Moslem religious leaders, but the message was clearly directed to a broader audience, coming on the eve of Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam's arrival in Washington for talks with President Reagan and other American officials on the crisis in Lebanon.   Mr. Khaddam and his Saudi Arabian counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal, who is accompanying him, have been delegated by the Arab League to urge the Reagan Administration to reconsider its Middle East policy and persuade Israel to withdraw."

This sudden change in sentiment was underscored late last week by the language that Wall Street understands best - rising prices and falling yields for securities.   Dealers say this rally was so powerful, in fact, that some profittaking is quite possible at the onset of a new trading week.  Meanwhile, a weak economy, the reaction to the failure of a Wall Street securities firm and an obliging Federal Reserve Board all have combined to produce a fresh sense of optimism in the fixed-income community."

In town, young men who strut the main square in fine-grained cowboy boots and raise its dust with new motorcycles perch themselves on wooden bleachers around a cockfighting ring and throw $10,000 bets on tables that until recently saw only small peso wagers.   The source of this largesse, according to townspeople, narcotics agents, former associates, relatives and drug enforcement authorities in Bolivia and the United States, is Roberto Suarez Gomez, who is somewhere in the vast surrounding pampas of Bolivia's Beni department on one of his many properties that they say are devoted to the cocaine trade.   To the residents of Santa Ana, he is Papito, or Daddy, the remote cattle town's most cherished figure, who buys food for the poor, restores churches, strings colored lights in the plaza at Christmas, passes out sewing machines to women and paves village streets.   He is referred to with the honorific Don before his name and is frequently compared to Robin Hood.  To narcotics agents and other operators in the booming business, he is the padrino, or godfather, said to be the biggest drug dealer in Bolivia and therefore quite likely in the world."

Mr. Rogers, who helped formulate the aggressive anticorporate strategies that forced J.P. Stevens & Company several years ago to recognize the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers union at 10 of its 80 plants, is given to audacious tactics. Looking as burly and aggressive as he did when he played guard during his high school football days, the 38-year-old Mr. Rogers has a ''them'' and ''us'' philosophy that is sometimes alien to union leaders today. He has earned the reputation of a man who will ignore protocal, fashion new rules and design slashing attacks on corporations and their executives.   But on Aug. 18, the day Mr. Rogers planned to disclose that a broad coalition of labor had come out in strong support for the strikers and that there would be a widened attack on business institutions tied to Brown & Sharpe, it was announced, instead, that Mr. Rogers's two-month contract with the union was not being extended. The union said only that Mr. Rogers's contract had been fulfilled. In essence, it seems accurate to say, Mr. Rogers was dismissed."

Mr. Marcos's Philippine Airlines jet touched down shortly after 11 A.M. at Andrews Air Force Base, where in brief remarks to State Department officials and about 100 Filipino-American well-wishers, he reminded Americans of their debt to the Philippines.   ''I bring the fraternal greetings,'' Mr. Marcos said, ''of the 50 million Filipinos who are your friends and have been your friends in the most critical days of the past and continue to maintain the reservoir of good will for America and the Americans - even if you occasionally forget about them.'' Last Visit Was 16 Years Ago   Mr. Marcos last visited Washington 16 years ago, shortly after he was elected president. In 1972, he established martial law in the Philippines, creating an authoritarian regime that has drawn criticism at home and abroad."

In them lie reasons for both the nation's prowess and its problems as an international trade partner.  First, many foreigners believe that because land and food are very expensive in Japan the Japanese standard of living must be under constant pressure.  Indeed, land prices are high, but this is because of the density of economic activities. The size of Japan is only one twenty-fifth that of the United States, but its gross national product is two-fifths that of America. The G.N.P. per acre in Japan is thus 10 times as large as that of the United States. Agriculture is land-intensive too, raising the price for farm commodities."

But other informants said that some ministers at the Cabinet meeting had been skeptical about the ability of the Palestine Liberation Organization to reach a decision acceptable to all its factions.

But a new group of glamorous spokesmen has taken to the airwaves - key corporate executives.   High-powered corporate leaders like Frank Borman of Eastern Airlines, Lee A. Iacocca of Chrysler, David Mahoney of Avis Rent-a-Car and Frank Sellinger of Schlitz Brewing have attempted to combat slumping sales and declining consumer confidence in today's recessionary economy by starring in commercials for their respective companies.   The rationale behind these advertising campaigns is simple. Many marketing experts believe that the C.E.O. is a highly credible commercial spokesman, especially in hard times such as these, because he is personally tied to his company's fate. Consumer research studies indicate that the public believes a C.E.O. will deliver on promises of better service or improved quality rather than face the prospect of poor corporate performance and possible dismissal."

Possible remnants of the original Palestinian forces in Beirut, hundreds of Palestinians in northern Lebanon and strong guerrilla forces across the ''porous'' Syrian border and with Syrian forces in the Bekaa Valley were cited as conditions that argue against a short operation.   Analysts in this country and at Atlantic alliance headquarters in Brussels seriously question the ability of the regular Lebanese forces to contain the Christian Phalangist militia, various Moslem militias and any revival of P.L.O. activity."

Edward J. DeBartolo, one of the nation's leading shopping center developers, and Kenneth Treister, a Miami architect and center owner, say that upscale, European-style centers similar to their Miami prototype would be feasible in several other American cities. The prototype, Mayfair in the Grove, has been open for three years.   ''We can see an application of this concept in a number of cities, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Washington, each of which represents a strong attraction to tourists,'' Mr.  DeBartolo said in a recent telephone interview."

He also said the Lebanese crisis underscored the importance to American security of close ties with friendly Arab states.   In some seven hours of testimony on the first day of his confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Shultz balanced those remarks by stressing that Israel was the United States' ''closest friend'' in the Middle East and that no one ''should dispute the depth and durability of America's commitment to the security of Israel or of our readiness to assure that Israel has the necessary means to defend herself.'' Criticism of Israel   ''I share in this deep and enduring commitment,'' he said. ''And more, I recognize that democratic Israel shares with us a deep commitment to the security of the West.''"

The zigzagging career that Mr. Muraoka, a 50-year-old division manager, has experienced at Toyo Kogyo, the producer of Mazda cars and Japan's third-largest auto maker, is not unusual in Japan.   A management employee in a large Japanese company will typically move into new jobs in different fields repeatedly during his career, at intervals ranging from two to seven years.   American and European corporations also have programs of job rotation to broaden the experience and training of their managers.  But the Japanese-style shuffling of people into new disciplines every few years is a practice that is rare in Western corporations."

Yet, because those procedures were designed for traumatic injuries, not subtle diseases, relatively few workers have actually collected compensation benefits for occupational diseases.  Frustrated by delays and obstruction, workers turn to litigation, not against their employers (which is generally prohibited by compensation law), but against third parties like Manville which supplied the employers with the dangerous substance. Today, there are 16,500 suits against Manville, and the total may add 32,000 more as the long latent asbestosis, mesothelioma and lung cancers manifest themselves.

Frank Sinatra, her co-star in her last movie, M-G-M's ''High Society'' in 1956, and her close friend, issued a statement describing the Princess as ''a gracious, wonderful woman who was a princess from the moment she was born.'' Mr. Sinatra said he was ''stunned, shocked, and totally grief-stricken.''   James Stewart, who co-starred with her in Alfred Hitchcock's ''Rear Window'' in 1954, described her death as ''shocking and tragic.'' Through a spokesman, Mr. Stewart went on to say: ''She was a most accomplished and extremely popular actress. When she assumed the duties of royalty, she did an equally masterful job. Throughout both of her careers, she had one basic attribute - Class!''"

The essential first step is gaining Israeli acceptance of the proposed international peacekeeping force.  At stake, according to the officials, are future American relations with the Government of Menachem Begin and the credibility of the United States in the Arab world. Displeasure With Begin   The officials indicated that if Israel did not agree to withdraw its troops from the Beirut area and accept the international force, Mr. Reagan was prepared to go very far, without specifying what that meant, toward making clear his displeasure with the Begin Government as now constituted."

The shortage of holders of Ph.D's in business school subjects has grown so severe in recent years that a panel was set up in 1980 by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business to study the problem.   A few months ago, Dr. Robert S. Kaplan, dean of the Carnegie-Mellon University Graduate School of Industrial Administration; Dr. Lyman W. Porter, dean of the Graduate School of Management of the University of California at Irvine, and Dr. Kenneth R. Smith, dean of the College of Business and Public Administration of the University of Arizona, released their findings."

The rise in the index, which followed a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in June, was generally expected and provided another sign that the economy might be at the threshold of a sluggish recovery, according to several economists.   Despite this glimmer of optimism, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, in a statement released with the index, cautioned that there would be few signs of any upturn this quarter, contrary to earlier Administration projections.   ''Key coincident indicators, such as payroll employment, industrial production and real G.N.P., are unlikely to show much change for the third quarter,'' he said."

Respectful, because the four-year-old coalition, known as East Brooklyn Churches, has worked assiduously to stabilize and restore the three blighted neighborhoods. And because its effort is supported by the leaders of several religious denominations, including Bishop Francis J. Mugavero of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, and Bishop Robert C. Witcher of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island.   But skeptical, too, because these neighborhoods' devastation, which rivals that of the South Bronx, seemed to make it unlikely that even the 1,000 homes planned for the first stage of the project could be sold. And because the coalition's pledge to establish a $12 million construction loan fund from contributions by the denominations seemed too good to be true. And also because the coalition wanted the city to lend buyers of the first 1,000 homes $10,000 each - a total of $10 million -to reduce the homes' purchase price."

In an unusually sharp statement, Mr. Reagan added, ''We condemn the perpetrators of this heinous crime against Lebanon and against their cause of peace in the Middle East.''   The White House statement, issued late tonight, expressed deepest sympathy to the Gemayel family, and said, ''The tragedy will be all the greater if men in countries friendly to Lebanon permit disorder to continue in this war-torn country.'' 'U.S. Stands By Lebanon'   Mr. Reagan added that the ''U.S. Government stands by Lebanon with its full support in its hour of need.'' American officials said earlier that the assassination raised the possibility of new fighting in that country between Mr. Gemayel's Christian Phalangist forces and Moslem leftists."

'STING' ROLE ASSAILED BY HITACHI,"  In a brief to be filed in the Federal court here Wednesday, lawyers for Japan's Hitachi Ltd. accuse the International Business Machines Corporation of playing an ''improper role in orchestrating a criminal investigation and resulting indictment for anticompetitive and other purposes.''   The brief, made available by the company today, is the latest legal move in a criminal case growing out of a ''sting'' operation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in California's Silicon Valley late last year and in 1982. The operation resulted in indictments against Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Ltd. and 21 individuals on charges that they stole secret documents and computer equipment from I.B.M.   Both of the big Japanese electronics concerns have pleaded not guilty to the charges.  The Hitachi brief is being filed in response to a motion filed by I.B.M., Palyn Associates, a Silicon Valley electronics consulting concern, and the Federal Government that seeks to quash subpoena powers that the court earlier granted to Hitachi. The subpoenas, granted to Hitachi under discovery rules of evidence, are intended to ascertain the extent of I.B.M.'s role in the F.B.I. ''sting'' operation."

As groups of soldiers and journalists watched the shelling, a radio played an old Beatles' song, ''Eight Days a Week.''   In the latest phase of the campaign against the Palestinians holed up in the western side of the capital, it was what military people call a day of ''softening up.'' For the record, the Israeli military spokesman, Barry Swersky, said the shelling was in retaliation for a bazooka attack on an Israeli position Saturday afternoon."

''These big caps,'' one broker points out, ''can easily absorb large amounts of cash.'' The rationale here is that pension funds and other institutions can snap up blocks of, say, 50,000 shares without disturbing prices unduly. And that, incidentally, is a great comfort to institutions (as well as their brokers) when they feel the urge to commit cash to equities."

These days, the merest scent of good news is considered a good omen in the credit markets.  The source of the current wave of optimism is the Federal Reserve.  Encouraged by three consecutive weekly declines in the nation's basic money supply and worried about signs that the economy sagged again last month, the Fed has been pumping money into the banking system, fueling speculation that the long-awaited decline in interest rates may be at hand.   Analysts do not dispute that the Fed has been more accomodating lately; but some say underlying fundamentals make it unlikely the trend will last long, nor will it have much positive impact on rates. If the Fed adds too much to the money supply, it will renew inflation fears."

Still, the cost to Citicorp - $143 million higher than any other bid - seemed to some analysts a bit too dear, even for a chance to break into the lucrative California retail market.

Writing in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, he conceded that the decision, announced June 15 in the United Nations, had been taken despite the United States' plans for an arms buildup and its crusade against the Soviet bloc through propaganda and economic sanctions.   ''In their totality, the actions of the United States are aimed at creating prerequisites for a struggle to destroy socialism as a socio-political system,'' Marshal Ustinov said in an unusually long statement on nuclear doctrine that took up a full page in Pravda.

Although the election by Lebanon's Parliament of the military leader of the Maronite Christians was strongly opposed by leftists and many Moslems in Lebanon, the view in Washington was that Mr.  Gemayel can be expected to give priority to asking the Syrians to leave the Bekaa Valley.   Mr. Gemayel's close ties with Israel - his election was warmly welcomed by Prime Minister Menachem Begin today - should also make it easier to bring about the withdrawal of the Israelis, officials said.    President Reagan, vacationing in California, sent a congratulatory message to Mr. Gemayel within hours of his election.

In defiance of an American ban, the French Government has ordered Alsthom-Atlantique to supply the huge rotors, which it makes under license from General Electric, for turbine-powered compressor plants that will send Siberian natural gas through a 3,700-mile pipeline into Western European factories and homes. Without these large compressors, the project as originally planned would be doomed.   The spoiler role is one that Alsthom-Atlantique, the only European company with the technology to build the rotors, would rather not play.   ''Of course we have to do what the Government decides, but we don't want a row with the Americans,'' said Roger Chalvon-Demersay, a senior Alsthom-Atlantique executive, stressing that the company has worked closely with General Electric since the end of World War II.  And there were rumors in Paris that the company had fought behind the scenes to delay the French Government's order while European governments continued diplomatic efforts to bring about a White House change of heart."

A ranking department official said that ''plenty of pressure'' was being applied to elected Salvadoran officials by American diplomats.  The diplomats, he said, had pointed out that Congress had grown resistant, if not hostile, to military aid for El Salvador unless the nation moves ahead on its land redistribution program, human rights efforts and the investigation into the murders in 1980 and 1981 of six Americans, including four churchwomen.   Administration efforts have taken on a new urgency because the 1982 foreign aid authorization for El Salvador largely conditions American military and economic aid there on President Reagan's certifying to Congress that the nation is making progress on economic and political changes.  The certification, stipulated by Congress, must reach the House and Senate by July 28."

A source close to the struggle said of the Bendix and Marietta tenders, ''It's now crystal clear that each company will have more than 50 percent of the shares of the other That brings us back to the question: Will each pull the trigger?''

Mr. Begin, in a statement Tuesday in Jerusalem, alluded to President Francois Mitterrand when he said that a terrorist attack in a Jewish neighborhood in which six people were killed had resulted from ''horrendous talk about Oradour.'' He was apparently speaking about a statement attributed to Mr. Mitterrand in early July that compared the Israeli assaults on Beirut to a Nazi wartime massacre of 600 French civilians in Oradour-sur-Glane.   Mr. Cheysson said that Mr. Begin's remarks had been made ''under the shock of emotion.'' Mr. Cheysson's comment came as Jews here held a rally tonight near Notre Dame Cathedral to protest anti-Semitic terrorism.

Savings bonds have long paid a much lower rate of interest than marketable Government securities and other top-quality investments but it now appears they may once again become attractive to buyers.   The Senate Finance Committee approved late last week a Treasury proposal to raise the yield on savings bonds, now a maximum of 9 percent over eight years, to 85 percent of the rate paid on five-year Treasury notes. If this formula were to be put into effect now, the savings bond rate would jump to 11.8 percent."

The rise is a major reason why the dollar defied expectations of many analysts and stayed at near-record levels.   In the September issue of World Financial Markets, international economists at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company calculate that between January and May of this year $25.6 billion worth of foreign capital was deposited in various United States financial instruments, a 54.2 percent rise from the total during the last half of 1981. At the same time, deposits in West Germany and Japan, two countries whose currencies have dropped sharply in relation to the dollar, registered large net outflows."

The appeals, made by telephone to journalists in Britain and South Africa, illustrated the desperation of the rebellious soldiers who on Tuesday occupied the Government radio station in the scattered, Indian Ocean islands, complaining to reporters who got in touch with them that they had been ''treated like pigs'' by their officers.   Only 17 days ago, air force men from the same low ranks as the Seychelles mutineers staged an abortive coup in Kenya, and the coincidence of the two uprisings will probably cause other African leaders to look with unease at the nether ranks of their armed forces.

Analysts attributed the strong market at least in part to the Federal Reserve Board's announcement after the close of trading Friday that the nation's basic money supply had fallen $3.7 billion.

Other favorites include selected cyclical stocks, such as those of broadcasting and publishing companies, that stand to shine with any improvement in consumer spending, and industries, like food processing, that can benefit if commodity prices stay depressed.   Energy issues, however, were at the bottom of almost every analyst's list because of the oil glut and the new prospect of stable prices for Mexican oil.   The bullish views were expressed despite some predictions that the decline in interest rates signaled continued weakness in the economy, not recovery. It was last week's long-awaited drop in interest rates that sparked the market rally, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing by 81.24 points in the week.

This portion of the draft calls for Israeli forces to pull back from Beirut as a first step toward a withdrawal from Lebanon. It directs lightly armed P.L.O. guerrillas to move into camps somewhere outside the Lebanese capital. The P.L.O. would give up its heavy weapons but apparently remain in Lebanon."

The Israeli radio said today that the commander, Assad Suleiman Abdel Khader, whom it described as one of the founders of Al Fatah, the major guerrilla organization, surrendered to Israeli soldiers in the southern Lebanese coastal city of Sidon, site of the P.L.O.'s former headquarters for the area.   The prisoner, who is known in the guerrilla movement as Salah Taamri, was quoted as having said that he was certain Yasir Arafat, head of both the P.L.O. and Al Fatah, would also face reality and conclude that the only way to save the Palestinian people was for the P.L.O. to leave west Beirut and continue the struggle against Israel by peaceful means rather than military force."

The meeting, at the Black Sea retreat where Mr. Brezhnev is vacationing, was one of a series that the Soviet leader holds each summer with leaders of the Eastern European countries. But concern over the situation in Poland was reflected in the official description of the trip as ''a short working visit,'' whereas other visitors who saw Mr. Brezhnev were described as being on vacation.   The account given by Tass, the Soviet Government's press agency, made no mention of the clashes that occurred last week in several Polish cities and flared up again today in Warsaw. But General Jaruzelski appeared to have given a sobering account of continuing resistance to martial law that, at least in the Tass version, omitted the assurances he gave in March about the Polish authorities' ability to ''tackle the threat with our own forces,'' as he put it then."

Last week, the Manville Corporation, the largest asbestos producer in the country, omitted its quarterly dividend, and admitted for the first time that the continuing flood of asbestos litigation, which cost it $8.6 million in the first half of the year, was imperiling its financial health. Because it is impossible to estimate Manville's potential liability in the thousands of claims against it, the company's auditors have for two years qualified their opinion of Manville's annual report.   A week before Manville's announcement, the Chicago-based UNR Industries filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, citing 17,000 claims against it related to asbestos pipe insulation it had not made since 1962.

The first reports of the action inaccurately said that the Sheffield had been destroyed by a fire in her aluminum upper works. The ship, however, was of all-steel construction. So was the destroyer Coventry, which was also lost in the South Atlantic conflict."

The new trial, coupled with recent arrests of people opposed to the Government, has focused attention on what is broadly termed the human rights situation here, and the outcome is expected to be seen as an indication of the Government's views toward liberalization of Haiti's long-restrictive society. Several representatives of international human rights groups are expected to be present for the trial.   The 22 who will be retried include Sylvio Claude, the leader of Haiti's tiny Christian Democratic group, and 21 associates who were arrested and charged with conspiracy against the Government and arson in a roundup of those viewed as opposing the Government in November 1980. Last March Haiti's high court overturned their sentences of 15 years at hard labor and ordered a new trial on the ground that the original punishment was inappropriate."

It seemed to many when the party's political bureau advanced Amin's name Thursday night that he would have little difficulty in winning the election to be held by Parliament for a successor to President Elias Sarkis, whose six-year term is due to end next Thursday. Today Amin's supporters still thought he would win, even though a rival candidate appeared who might split the vote.   The National Liberal Party today named its 82-year-old leader, former President Camille Chamoun, to oppose him in the race.  Mr.  Chamoun and his party had helped make Amin's late brother, Bashir, the President-elect on Aug. 23.  There was no immediate explanation of why the former President decided to make the race himself against a Gemayel who was being pictured as the ''consensus candidate.''"

In the steel industry, for example, some of the cuts have been dramatic.

Bond prices also soared as hopes grew that a recent plunge in interest rates for Treasury bills and other short-term borrowings had spread to the long-term markets that finance job-creating investment in housing and new plants. The rate decline was attributed to the persistent recession and the prospect of shrinking demand for business loans.   Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange responded with a roar of appreciation as stocks, which had lost out to high interest rates in the competition for investors' funds, soared in price.

The $7 is more than twice the average price for domestically produced gas at the wellhead."

Most companies in the industry today are experiencing sharp drops in sales and profits, layoffs and other retrenchments.

''Tribalism,'' the 57-year-old former school teacher has said at countless ribbon-cuttings and other ceremonies over the last few years, ''can be a menace to a young nation like Kenya.''   But at the same time, Mr. Moi, who has served as President since the death of Jomo Kenyatta in 1978, owes his office in large part to tribalism: In a nation where the Kikuyu tribal group is dominant in almost every area of life and the members of the Luo tribe are their chief - and often bitter - rivals, Mr. Moi is neither Kikuyu nor Luo, but a member of the small Tugen tribe of the minority Kalenjin group, one of Kenya's 70 distinct tribal groupings.   It was in recognition of this tribal diversity - and the fear that most of the tribes felt for the dominant Kikuyus long headed by Mr.  Kenyatta - that the Kenyan Constitution reserved the vice presidency for a non-Kikuyu."

Regan said today that the Administration would sharply reduce the scope of sanctions it had applied against two French companies that shipped equipment to the Soviet Union for its natural gas pipeline to Western Europe.   In what would be a substantial easing of penalties imposed by the United States for indirect export of its technology, the sanctions would affect only oil and gas equipment and would no longer bar corporate violators from receiving any United States products.   In their ''original pristine form,'' Mr. Regan said at a briefing, the sanctions ''were a little too sweeping without giving the precise definition of what was meant.'' He said the modification he and other Administration officials had urged on President Reagan was not a relaxation but ''a clarification.''"

That challenge centers in the growing economic might of the four ''new Japans,'' Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, all of which are moving out of labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, footwear and mundane electronics items, into higher-technology industries.   These states have modeled their industrial development policies after those of Japan. As Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, puts it: ''The Japanese have got it right.''   The inherent strengths of the five nations combined have led one of the believers in the area's future, Mike Mansfield, the United States Ambassador to Japan, to predict that the world is entering ''the century of the Pacific,'' and that this has far-reaching economic and strategic implications for the United States."

The economic benefit of lower interest rates, the analysts said, will come largely in the bond market, where the sales of issues due in more than 10 years during July and August equals the total for all of 1981 and the first six months of this year. Sales of long-term bonds relieve companies from the pressure and risk of renewing shortterm borrowings frequently at interest rates that can fluctuate widely.   Because of fears that many troubled foreign borrowers and domestic companies will stop making interest payments, ''banks may be slower than normal to reduce the prime rate until the dimensions of the problem are better understood,'' said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank."

It helps keep markets liquid during dull periods and smoothes out the price peaks and valleys when they are volatile.   While arbitrage operations affect every futures trader's fortunes, few can participate in these lightning quick deals. At best, the average futures trader can only use the common form of arbitrage: the spread, also known as the straddle. Spreads have long been used by conservative futures traders who prefer to try to take what they consider to be limited risks, rather than face the much greater odds that attend taking ''straight'' positions in a commodity."

Phillips in his new book, ''Post-Conservative America,'' published by Random House. The author, whose earlier writings foresaw the ascendency of the Republican party that culminated with President Reagan's 1980 election victory, says now that the contradictory and reactionary strains within Reaganism -supply-side economics and monetarism, among others - are a product of Republican politicians looking back in nostalgia for answers to present problems, rather than looking forward with a new vision.   An excerpt from his book is followed by a response from Paul Craig Roberts, a supply-side economist who resigned in February as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy. WHEN the first histories of the 1980's are written, the place of the radical transformation of c onservative economics will be as important as that of any other t ransformation - geographical, cultural or institutional. As the 1 970's opened, conservative economic theories were outsider credos b arely taken seriously by either the Republican Administration of R ichard Nixon or the business community; in 1981, monetarism, s upply-side economics and gold currency convertibility were r ecognized as the official economic theology of a new revolutionary c onservative government..."

But in this era of bargain prices, these issues are selling at lower multiples relative to growth prospects than other shares.   Yet, few investors seem to notice. A recent comment on investor attitudes during bear markets has particular relevance for the group. In the latest issue of ''The Shopping List,'' Oppenheimer & Company's Norman Weinger and E. Michael Metz write:   ''Equities are a unique commodity. Demand is stimulated by high and rising prices, while buyers virtually desert the bazaar'' when there are ''bargain sales at distress prices.''"

Otherwise, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon has said, Israel would have to place southern Lebanon in ''a special status.'' He has not defined this term, but it is believed to mean control by a pro-Israeli Christian militia and possibly some Israeli military presence, at least in the form of periodic patrols.   ''If a future Lebanese government signs a peace treaty with Israel,'' the Defense Minister said Monday night, ''Lebanon will certainly be territorially united. But if there is a government in Lebanon that for any reason does not sign a treaty, then there will certainly be a special status in south Lebanon along the 40-kilometer security strip Israel needs.''"

These apprehensions have proved almost totally unfounded. No punitive spirit seems to be operating elsewhere in governmental employee relations. On the contrary, just three weeks ago, New York State's Public Employment Relations Board canceled, after only three months, an order barring automatic checkoff of union dues for a teachers' union that had struck illegally in 1975."

In accepting the basic framework of the proposed decree as being ''plainly in the public interest,'' (within the definition of the Tunney Act) Judge Greene has affirmed the consensus that has slowly, sometimes painfully, emerged in recent years. It has seen pervasive regulation give way to competition as the preferred means of governing the telecommunications industry in this country.

The lessons concern not only a new sense of discipline in energy use, but also an urgent need for more efficient machinery. Detroit has been hard pressed to produce more fuel-efficient cars, and the manufacturers of air-conditioning systems have faced an equally challenging problem.   Consider, for example, the Federal Government's order in 1979 that its office buildings across the country be heated to no more than 68 degrees in the winter and cooled to no lower than 78 degrees in the summer. Although the rule still applies, it has been widely judged a failure because of the inefficiency of the complicated air-treatment systems in large office buildings."

Those were some of the early conclusions drawn by telephone industry analysts following Judge Greene's ruling, which asked for 10 modifications to the antitrust settlement announced Jan. 8 by the telephone company and the Justice Department.   The most significant changes for the Bell companies were three alterations that would most likely provide them with millions of dollars of additional revenues and help them hold down telephone rates, analysts said.   Under the changes, the units, to be divested under the antitrust settlement, would be allowed to keep the lucrative Yellow Pages business rather than cede it to A.T.&T., as the January settlement stated. They would also retain the right to market customer premise equipment - such as telephones and private switching systems - though they could not make the gear."

But Congress did take aim at a few selected areas affecting individuals, and none was more controversial or bitterly opposed than extending tax withholding to interest and dividends.   These new withholding provisions will likely affect more tax returns than any other measure in the tax bill, but they are also relatively straightforward. Beginning next July 1, companies and financial institutions will be required to withhold 10 percent of interest and dividend payments to individuals, much as employers now withhold from paychecks. The new law also extends withholding to payments to pensioners."

In Jersey City, for example, a water main break cut the supply to an entire urban population for several days while, in Lebanon, Israeli troops who control West Beirut's water supply have been able to interrupt the flow of water into that city at will.   And last year, in New York and many other areas throughout the Northeast, a serious drought led to depleted reservoirs and to water rationing for millions of residents."

The slump in the price of gold, which edged below $300 an ounce in late June and has since recovered to only about $310, is the latest in a series of punishing blows for the South African economy. Gold accounts for almost half of the nation's export earnings, and the mines - which produce more than 70 percent of the gold mined in the non-Communist world -are by far the largest single source of Government tax revenues.   Other key exports, such as diamonds, manganese and sugar, are also in the doldrums, while drought has wilted a third of the corn crop, South Africa's most important farm commodity."

CONCERN STIRS STUDY OF STATE AGENCIES' INVESTING,"  The collapse of a small government-securities concern has set off a wide re-examination of how New York State agencies should invest cash they have on hand.   The State Comptroller's office said yesterday it was considering the establishment of uniform guidelines for the state's authorities.  Until now, the different authorities have decided on their investment practices independently of the state, as they are empowered to do.   At the same time, the State Dormitory Authority said it had established a new, stricter policy of its own. That agency lent nearly $300 million of its excess cash to the concern that entered bankruptcy proceedings last week, Lombard Wall Money Markets Inc. The concern is a subsidiary of Lombard Wall Inc., which also filed bankruptcy proceedings."

''The recovery has been postponed to the fourth quarter.''   The Reagan Administration, hoping for a rebound by the crucial offyear Congressional elections, had promised a strong recovery in the second quarter and, when that did not materialize, a recovery in the third quarter. Just last week in Kansas, President Reagan said, ''Yes, the recovery has been sighted.'' And Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan has predicted that there would be relatively strong growth this quarter. But today Mr. Torda said ''you can flip a coin'' over whether the third quarter will show a small minus or a small plus.  The White House had no official comment."

The Israeli Cabinet action, in not posing any objection to the three-nation force re-entering the Lebanese capital, allowed plans to go ahead for its landing later this week, the State Department said.   But White House and State Department officials said that the Administration remained concerned that the Israelis had avoided giving a clear-cut statement on when Israeli forces would be withdrawn.   Meanwhile, the decision by the Israeli Cabinet against a special inquiry into the Beirut massacre fueled Congressional criticism of Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Government and reduced prospects for previously proposed increases in American aid.

But there are about a dozen races for the House of Representatives and at least one for the Senate where such issues as a freeze on nuclear weapons and rising military spending could tip the balance.   Moreover, three Republican Representatives, including Robert H.  Michel, the House minority leader, have been put on the defensive in central Illinois because of the job losses caused by another foreign policy issue - President Reagan's embargo on the sale of American equipment for the Soviet natural gas pipeline to Western Europe.   And the President's new Middle East peace proposal could develop into a touchy campaign issue for Republican incumbents in a few heavily Jewish districts if it causes sustained tensions with Israel."

The credit should not go to them, they say, but to the Reagan Administration.   The question of a Cuban withdrawal was never an issue in the seemingly interminable negotiations that South Africa held with five Western nations for four years, starting in 1977, over the future of the territory.   It remained in the background, as far as the South Africans were concerned, until June of last year when William P. Clark, who was then Deputy Secretary of State, visited here."

The issue is its decision to excise a fragment of the Zulu ''homeland'' and cede it to the neighboring kingdom of Swaziland.   Twice in one week early this month, Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, who is head of government in the fragmented state called KwaZulu and leader of what is said to be the largest black political movement in the country, has successfully gone to the courts to block proclamations of the white central Government.   The first proclamation, made under a law called the Black States Consitutions Act, removed from KwaZulu's jurisdiction a strip of territory called Ingwavuma that is wedged between Mozambique's southern border and Swaziland's southeastern corner. If the Government's plan to give Ingwavuma to Swaziland goes through as part of a larger transfer of land and population that also involves the Swazi ethnic homeland of KaNgwane, it would give the landlocked kingdom an outlet to the Indian Ocean."

Its most memorable and durable achievement was Ostpolitik, the policy initiatives of the early 1970's that improved relations with the Soviet Union and its allies, paved the way for the 1971 Berlin agreement calming that cold war troublespot and recognized the division of the country by establishing relations with the Communist Government of East Germany.

Penn Square, which had deposits of only $465 million, was highly aggressive in lending to the oil and gas industry and sold more than $2 billion of such loans to other banks. With the energy business in recession, it has become questionable whether many of these loans to independent oil and gas developers will be repaid.

By doubling its population in barely 20 years, the city provided a benchmark of the progress it has made as the capital of the Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.   Two years ago Leonid I. Brezhnev visited the city on the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Communist power and said that ''figuratively speaking, the republic itself has made a space flight,'' a reference to the fact that all Soviet manned space flights have begun at the Baikonur launching site at Leninsk, 750 miles northwest of here."

At stake is control of an international oil and gas exploration company that has rich - but, until recently, inaccessible - oil reserves in the Canadian Arctic. But to most investors, Global remains an obscure foreign company based on the tax-haven island of Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands.   At the same time, the company does not know, and has no effective way of learning, the identities of most of its shareholders. ''We have knots in Venezuela, a large group in Germany and a lot in the U.S.,'' Frank G. Beatty, Global's president, said. ''But we can't communicate directly with our shareholders, and a majority of them remain a mystery.''"

But economists are debating whether this will propel the economy out of recession or merely inflate the deficit and abort a recovery.   The Reagan Adminstration clearly hopes the tax cut will help stimulate an economic recovery. ''It'll be a plus in the early stages of the recovery that's now under way,'' said Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He predicted the tax cut would be an ''important shot in the arm'' to the economy, although he declined to give specific figures on its anticipated effect."

Many apartment buildings across the country have been financed in recent years with relatively short-term loans. So instead of the debt being paid off at the end of the loan, it must be refinanced.  Sometimes rental buildings are financed with balloon mortgages where little if any of the payment has been put toward amortizing the mortgage."

Short-term interest rates rose by a quarter to half a percentage point, while note and bond prices fell by a half to 1 point. The declines in the past two days have erased about half of last week's gains.   The lower prices were accompanied by growing doubts among some traders that the Federal Reserve has eased monetary policy. Last week, a large $3.7 billion drop in money supply, plus an increased availability of reserves in the banking system, provided traders with a motive for expecting an easier monetary policy and evidence that the Fed had already decided to make credit more available in the banking system."

The merger, if consummated, might involve as much as $650 million and would push Anheuser-Busch deeper into the food and wine business, which it has gradually been entering.   But Wall Street sources, who asked not to be identified, said the likelihood of such a merger seemed remote, partly because recent rises in the price of Campbell Taggart's stock might make the company too costly to purchase.   With Campbell Taggart's stock selling at about $30 a share before yesterday's announcement, Anheuser-Busch would have to offer close to $40 or more to gain the company's support for a takeover, analysts said. At that price, Campbell Taggart's nearly 16 million shares would be worth close to $650 million."

''Two prestigious business schools and a small country in South America.''   ''I'd say we're definitely one of the top five business schools in the country,'' said Boris Yavitz, who stepped down after seven years as dean this summer. However, in the next breath he concedes, ''But I know there are twelve schools in the top five.''   Asked to name the top five business schools in the country, though, the deans of other national business schools do not come up with Columbia: ''I'm sorry, but they're not up there yet,'' said Donald Carroll, dean of the Wharton School.

The educational community has fought a fierce and successful battle to restore many of the educational assistance cuts proposed by President Reagan, and funding for Federal aid programs for the 1982-83 academic year is at roughly the same levels as for the previous year. Furthermore, many of the Administration's harshest proposals - which would have drastically reduced the amount of funds available for the children of middle-class families - did not survive the Congressional budget process. The Senate override of the President's budget veto earlier this month, for example, preserved $212 million in funding for Pell grants, the basic component of student financial aid, as well as for some supplemental assistance programs."

Perhaps because of the nature of the Lebanese population, split between Moslems and Christians, blood feuds in this country are long and enduring, and the occasional periods of truce and coexistence uneasy.   In 1860 Maronite Christians and Moslem Druze fought pitched battles in the Chouf mountains southeast of here, bringing the intervention in Lebanon by France and other Western powers. Maronite Christians are a sect that follows the eastern rite but acknowledges the spiritual supremacy of the Pope in Rome. The Druze faith is an amalgam of Christian and Moslem beliefs."

The 47-year-old Mr. Lytle, who has been with the bank since 1959, had been responsible for Continental's lending to oil and gas producers in Oklahoma and nearby states.   Continental, the nation's sixth-largest bank, had invested more than $1 billion in loans generated by Penn Square and in loans made directly to the failed bank.   Most of the Penn Square loans reportedly went to small oil and gas producers in Oklahoma. With energy prices declining in recent months, many of these poorly capitalized and high-cost producers apparently were unable to meet their loan payments, according to banking sources, and this caused Penn Square's failure."

O'Neill Jr.  Mr. Foley's response to President Reagan's appeal for support for the $98.3 billion tax bill Monday night received almost universally positive reviews. Instead of rebutting Mr. Reagan's speech, the Washington Democrat, looking firm and fatherly, called for a vote of ''political courage,'' of ''economic reality'' - in favor of Mr.  Reagan's compromise tax increase package. Debut as Party's Point Man   Mr. Foley's television performance - his debut as his party's point man on a Presidential speech - proved that a House leader can also be a good soldier. Mr. Foley, several colleagues agreed, ardently believes that, despite the party's disagreement with President Reagan's economic strategy, supporting the tax measure is the ''responsible'' course."

Although upsetting to some consumers, the move is bound to please New York and other state authorities who, in an effort to capture millions of dollars in lost revenue, are trying to end these interstate tax advantages.   Under regulations as old as most tax statutes, a buyer does not have to pay any sales tax for most items purchased out of state and shipped to the buyer's home - as long as the seller does not have an outlet in the state of the buyer.

But the simplest ideas can be the most difficult to bring to market -even when the market is expected to reach $1 billion - perhaps even $6 billion - by 1990.

Until now, the Communists, who lost a great deal of ground to the Socialists in last year's election, have been careful to support publicly virtually every move of the Government, in which they hold 4 of 44 Cabinet positions. The party leadership reasoned that Socialist popularity and Communist electoral weakness made President Francois Mitterrand's coattails the only viable, if undignified, form of political transport.   Now the party is beginning to give the coattails some vicious tugs, while still riding. The Government's decision to impose a four-month freeze on prices and wages, raise payroll and corporate contributions to the unemployment fund and cut some social benefits has been the Communists' signal to move out to the left."

The Oraflex case, these critics say, comes at the worst possible time for the F.D.A., which has proposed changes in its procedure for reviewing new drug applications. The changes would reduce the amount of paperwork submitted in new drug applications by as much as 70 percent, and in many cases bring the drugs to market sooner.   In an interview, Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes Jr., the F.D.A.  commissioner, rejected charges that Oraflex's abrupt removal from the market resulted from oversights at his agency or that it would jeopardize the proposed procedural changes.

EXPRESSES DOUBT ON MARITIME SUBSIDIES,"  The American ocean shipping industry is ''not in a state of general distress'' and would benefit from less protection, contrary to widespread public opinion and to legislation now pending in Congress, the General Accounting Office says in a study expected to be published later this week.   The conclusion, in a 110-page study now in draft form, contrasts sharply with commonly accepted views of the nation's maritime industry. According to the report, data purporting to show a slide in the maritime industry's health over the last 10 years - a decline usually portrayed as a threat to national security - may have been misinterpeted.   The agency, the investigative arm of Congress, contends that the industry's figures indicate that advances such as containerization of cargo have permitted the shipping industry to do more with fewer vessels - meaning that it has become more efficient and not less healthy."

The pilot, a major who wished to remain anonymous, discussed in an interview how the bombing missions were selected, how targets were assigned and how the results were assessed. He did not deny that there were civilian casualties, but wondered whether blame was being assigned fairly.   Charges of indiscriminate bombing of Beirut prompted the 34-yearold major to seek out, through a mutual friend, a foreign reporter so that he could present a pilot's view on the extended bombing of the Lebanese capital, an effort that Israeli officials say persuaded the Palestinian guerrillas to leave."

Both Morton-Norwich, a Chicago-based chemicals and consumer products manufacturer, and Thiokol make specialty chemicals that are used in the electronics industry, particularly as etching substances and coating materials for semiconductors.

Morton-Norwich's announcement comes a month after it completed the sale of its pharmaceuticals division to Procter & Gamble for $371 million. At the time, Morton-Norwich said it was seeking an acquisition that would complement its chemicals business. The company had sought to sell its small but profitable pharmaceuticals business because of the big research and development costs associated with that industry."

Mr. Coats, who had spent six years as vice president and general counsel at Texas International Airlines, joined Braniff shortly after Howard D.

As in May, the increase in the Consumer Price Index resulted from a sharp rise in gasoline prices combined with higher food costs and a baffling rise in housing prices. Medical costs were also higher. Despite the two-month surge, however, the inflation rate is down from the levels of 1979 and 1980: In the past 12 months, the index has risen just 7.1 percent. Most economists predict it will be about 6 percent for the year. (Page 1.) Prices in the New York area rose 1.7 percent. (37.)   The Senate passed the largest revenue-raising bill ever after a sometimes acrimonious all-night session. In three years, the bill would recover for the Government $99 billion of the tax cuts enacted a year ago. As a last-minute means of achieving the mandated figure, the Senate voted to halve business deductions for meals other than those on overnight trips. (1.) That provision drew a negative reaction from restaurateurs and credit card sponsors. (35.) Another provision, establishing a 10 percent withholding tax on dividends and interest, was criticized in the banking and thrift industries. (36.)"

President-elect Amin Gemayel, according to the same sources, is not believed to have known much about the operation, which spread to the adjacent Sabra camp. Although he was in the leadership of the Phalangists and now heads the right-wing party, he was effectively excluded from its military circle and was apparently not involved in the planning. His brother, Bashir, who was also President-elect and was assassinated Sept. 14, said before his death that he planned to disband the Christian militia and strengthen the regular Lebanese Army, which is a separate force of about 22,000 men.   From the information supplied by the sources, it could not be determined whether the massacre that occurred after the troops went in was planned from the beginning."

''There is a fear that the Federal Reserve has stopped easing,'' one Government securities dealer said. To see whether or not the Fed is continuing to make reserves more available in the banking system, analysts were watching the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market. Since the funds rate tends to fall when the Federal Reserve makes credit more available to the banking system and rise when reserves are scarcer, it is regarded as a weather vane to the Fed's intentions."

Few would argue that brief, and perhaps even sizable, deviations of money from a desired longer-term path have significant repercussions either for total spending and inflation or for expectations about their future movements as long as market participants recognize that the deviations will be corrected.   Today's market participants, however, have neither the information for making that judgment, nor the requisite amount of faith in the intention or the ability of the Federal Reserve to carry out its objectives. An improved money control mechanism buttressed by more specific information about the central bank's objectives would help to rebuild credibility."

It has vanished from Israeli maps. It has dissolved into the stonestrewn hills that rise gracefully from the outskirts of Tel Aviv. It has left no reminder of the tense frontier between Jordan and Israel that it once was - no scrap of fence, no army checkpoint, no clue to the traveler that he is passing from one world into another.   After 15 years of Israeli occupation, the West Bank can no longer be defined by its old border. Israel has not annexed the territory outright, but is spilling into it, infiltrating it, changing its residential and land-ownership patterns until the dividing lines between Israeli and Arab societies, between elected and appointed government, between civilian and martial law, have been gradually redrawn into a jigsaw puzzle of Israeli townships and Arab villages existing under two entirely separate systems. A Deeply Entrenched Presence   Most of this has happened in the five years that Menachem Begin has been Prime Minister. He is determined to see the West Bank, which he calls by the ancient names Judea and Samaria, under permanent Israeli sovereignty. The situation has progressed so far that a freeze on further Jewish settlement, as proposed by President Reagan, would still leave the Israeli presence deeply entrenched."

Under the nuclear agreement, low-enriched uranium fuel for a United States-built atomic power plant near Bombay is to be provided to India by a third country, France, instead of by the United States.  The move gets around a problem created by an American law blocking shipments from this country.

These analysts believe the Iranians will seize Basra and possibly move north toward Baghdad in the hope that this advance might suffice to unseat Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein. This is one of Iran's war aims."

In a recent newsletter, John S.

Some rumors, above all those relating to financial questions, seem to flow almost naturally from the currency crisis, but others are so detailed in spreading word of purported incidents that many political analysts believe they are planted with the intent of causing distress.

''It is saddening and bodes ill that the cream of Mr.  Reagan's Administration is leaving or has already left,'' the publication mourned. The roll call of Presidential advisers who have left, the editor hinted, is a clue that the Administration ''is simply another disappointing detour on our road to serfdom.''   Though more outspoken than most, this lament is heard widely in right-wing circles in Washington, and has to do with the exodus of most, if not virtually all, of the supply-side economic theorists who rode into power with Ronald Reagan a year and a half ago.   The list does not, however, include the departure announced Thursday of Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Weidenbaum, who will return to teaching, is a gardenvariety conservative. The supply-siders who left ahead of him were not."

As 19thcentury Russian nationalist composers go, he had a small output, but his tone poem ''Night on Bald Mountain'' - which features kettle drumming that portrays thunder - lived on as the music for a segment of the Walt Disney movie ''Fantasia.''   And now ''Night on Bald Mountain'' is getting another lease on life, thanks largely to Lee Farrell, advertising manager for Dodge trucks, even though his taste runs more to Neapolitan love songs.   Mr. Farrell and other music lovers at the Chrysler Corporation have adapted a bit of the tone poem into the background music for television commercials for the Turbo Diesel Dodge Ram 50 and other models in the 1983 Dodge line of light-duty trucks."

It was still not clear early today what the objective of the Israeli advance was - a full-scale assault on west Beirut, the Palestinian-controlled half of the capital, or a limited incursion designed to intensify military pressure on the P.L.O. to withdraw unconditionally from Lebanon, as Israel has demanded.   The exchange of heavy artillery fire was still continuing at 7:30 A.M., and there were reports of intense battles in the port and the airport areas.   (In Israel, the military command said hours after the assault began that the action was ''not a general offensive'' to conquer the city but rather was a ''tightening of the siege.'' Page A10.)"

There is an inevitable sense of displacement, reflecting the temporary nature of his task.   ''A liquidation office is not a place for permanent employment,'' he said with a shrug.  Mr. Hudson is chief liquidator of the Penn Square Bank, and the desk at which he sits is that of Bill P. Jennings, formerly the bank's chairman and still its largest shareholder.   Under Mr. Jennings's leadership, the bank surged to become the fourth biggest in Oklahoma City on the strength of its free-wheeling energy loans. But on July 5, with the bank having run up an estimated $40 million to $50 million in bad loans, with its internal procedures under attack and its financial position deteriorating, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ordered it closed. Now, Mr. Jennings is gone and no one is available to discuss the problem at his elegant house north of town."

However, in the view of some bankers and economists, the Fed's injection of large amounts of reserves into the banking system last week was primarily an effort to calm jittery financial markets.   The major factor that unsettled the markets was the failure last Monday of the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City.  In more ordinary times, the failure of a bank with $500 million in assets would have been greeted more calmly. But the collapse occurred in a time of great economic uncertainty, with many corporations starved for cash, with corporate profits depressed and with a number of major companies on the brink of bankruptcy."

Regan has started a campaign to discredit the prime rate as the benchmark of the nation's interest-rate structure.   It appears that most economists, including many who bitterly disagree with Mr. Regan on broad policy issues, go along with his contention that the prime is a misleading indicator of the general level of interest rates.   ''The prime rate has many shortcomings,'' said Victor Zarnowitz, professor of economics and finance at the University of Chicago Business School. ''There are various rates that indicate different things, and the prime is only one of them,'' he said."

TAKES A PAGE FROM JAPAN'S BOOK,"  GEORGE STATHAKIS gets his exercise these days from tennis, sailing a nd golf, but the president and chief executive of the General E lectric Company's new trading subsidiary clearly reserves a special p lace in his heart for football.   A center on the University of California team that played in the 1950 Rose Bowl, Mr. Stathakis is convinced that football is a good way to prepare for business. ''You learn that when you get knocked down, you have to get up,'' he told a recent visitor to the office that he is occupying in Westport, Conn., until he can find an apartment near the trading company's Manhattan headquarters.   That lesson has come in handy during his 29-year career at G.E., especially during the time when he served as general manager of G.E.'s troubled nuclear energy business. In that assignment, he tackled normal management problems as well as the need to represent G.E. in the sometimes controversial debate over nuclear power. His move in 1977 to international trading brought a respite from such public responsibility, but that ended with G.E.'s decision in March to place him at the helm of a new trading subsidiary, with the new task of exporting goods made by other companies in addition to many made by G.E."

If only France, without Britain (which had some excellent combat divisions), had attacked the aggressor, there would have remained no trace of Nazi German power and a war which, in three years, changed the whole of human history, would have been prevented.   This therefore, is the international example that explains what is war without choice, or a war of one's choosing.  Let us turn from the international example to ourselves. Operation Peace for Galilee is not a military operation resulting from the lack of an alternative. The terrorists did not threaten the existence of the state of Israel; they ''only'' threatened the lives of Israel's citizens and members of the Jewish people. There are those who find fault with the second part of that sentence. If there was no danger to the existence of the state, why did you go to war?"

Yet such assemblies as the one now winding up in Toronto sometimes mysteriously bear fruit.   Japan's Minister of Finance, Michio Watanabe, brought the wisdom of the East to explain this mystery. ''I would like to close,'' he told his fellow delegates, ''with my favorite expression in Oriental philosophy: 'What is emptiness, that is form.' As 'emptiness' also means 'sky' in Japanese, it symbolizes what is infinite and intangible, such as the heart."

Although Israeli forces have been deployed for some time in the hills outside Christian-controlled eastern Beirut, it was the first time that their armored equipment set up positions in the city at the so-called Green Line, which has separated the two sections since the Lebanese civil war of 1975-76.   The move appeared designed to tighten the stranglehold on western Beirut to force the withdrawal of Yasir Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and 6,000 guerrillas. Israelis All Over East Beirut   A reporter who visited the east side said that the Israelis were no longer making any effort to conceal their presence and that their armored personnel carriers, jeeps and soldiers were all over the city, with many tanks poised in the eastern hills."

''If the Habib plan fails because Israel doesn't accept it and the P.L.O. does accept it,'' Foreign Minister Fuad Butros said, ''the United States will be held responsible for the destruction of Beirut.''   The Habib plan is now sometimes referred to as the Lebanese plan because of certain modifications suggested by the Lebanese side and agreed to by the United States envoy.   The plan calls for the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force simultaneously with the departure of the first group of Palestinian fighters.

ROTOR,"  THE case of the General Electric rotor appears to be an example of superior American technology being used as a diplomatic weapon.  The Soviet Union was planning to use dozens of turbines designed by the General Electric Company on a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Siberia to Western Europe. President Reagan, in hopes of delaying or killing the project, which he thinks will enrich the Soviet Union and make Western Europe too dependent on the Russians for energy, has banned the use of American technology on the pipeline.   But the case is not as simple as it seems. The turbines involved do not represent the latest in high technology; they have been on the market for more than 10 years. Until last December, they were considered commonplace enough that no license was needed to export them to the Soviet Union. Indeed, many of the same turbines already operate in the Soviet Union on other pipelines."

Although the Bankers Trust Company surprised the market by cutting its prime lending rate by a half-point, to 13 percent, the move had no discernible impact on the money market, dealers said.   The increased liquidity caused rates on overnight interbank lending, known as Federal funds rates, to fall to as low as 8.75 percent, down a full point from the opening level. The cheaper credit subsequently led to sharp declines in short- and long-term Treasury debt instruments."

Of the $3.4 billion, $2.3 billion represents principal and $1.1 billion represents interest. Although banks often agree to stretch out payments of principal for countries in financial difficulties, it is rare for banks to agree to postponements of interest payments. In the United States, the failure of a borrower to make interest payments as originally scheduled requires the bank to list such credits among its ''nonaccruing,'' or problem, loans."

Generally, Western diplomats and businessmen who follow the trade think that the Soviet Union's pressing need for grain imports will impel it to accept a 12-month extension, just as it did when a similar extension was offered last year. This year's Soviet harvest will be a poor and possibly even disastrous one, and Western forecasts are that the Kremlin will be looking abroad again for at least 40 million tons of wheat, corn and other grains.   But the Soviet decision is by no means certain. A week after President Reagan announced his decision, choosing a middle course between those in the Administration who wanted a long-term agreement and those who favored abandoning it, the Soviet press has offered no comment on the American move. This in itself suggests that there is debate inside the Kremlin about how to react."

John Nott, the Minister of Defense, has decided to replace all the aircraft and ships lost in the fighting, in some cases by reversing plans to remove vessels from service, while also improving the quality of equipment being built or designed.   But he has insisted that the Treasury will pay for the replacement costs, which were not made public, out of contingency funds, while the new costs would not push the defense budget, $24.5 billion for 1982-83 at current prices, beyond the 3 percent annual increase in military spending committed under NATO agreement.   The projections, reflecting lessons learned in the Falkland fighting, were announced last week by Mr. Nott in introducing a white paper listing military objectives.

Normally the consumer services department, this is now the rumor control center for Procter, the consumer goods giant that has lately become the focus of a nationwide rumor campaign.   The rumors, first appearing about two years ago, essentially contend that Procter's 132-year-old trademark, which shows the Man in the Moon and 13 stars representing the original colonies, is a symbol of Satanism and Devil worship. The rumor-mongering also urges a Christian boycott of Procter's products, which include Pampers, Duncan Hines and Folger's plus dozens of other well-known names."

In the past few decades, they have watched the trucking industry - fueled by the expanding network of interstate highways - wrest away lucrative traffic in fresh foods and manufactured goods. At the same time, they have been hobbled by dilapidated equipment, rising costs and an inability to create new markets.   But the once lumbering rail freight business has, in many ways, become much leaner and far more aggressive for its hard times, and it is now making a comeback that some say is reminiscent of the industry's heyday.   ''For a while it looked like the pendulum was swinging away, that it was an industry on the way out,'' said Richard H. Fischer, a rail analyst for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. ''But it is an industry with renewed vigor and strength.''"

He said the Soviet Union was demanding absolute security for itself, ''which is tantamount to absolute insecurity for all other countries.''"

Despite their philosophical commitment to private ownership, most American bankers applauded the nationalization as a much needed step to bolster international confidence in the Mexican banking system.   Fearing that the Mexican Government would not stand behind the debts of the private banks, other banks around the world had been refusing to deposit money in Mexican banks or to lend money to them, thereby putting them in danger of failure.   ''This is a positive step in that it puts the Mexican Government clearly behind its banking system,'' said a spokesman for the Bank of America, which has about $3 billion in loans to Mexico."

He reversed himself today, after a week of rising criticism across the Israeli political spectrum, and from foreign governments and Jewish organizations abroad.   His proposal to set up the commission, made at a special Cabinet meeting today, received the unanimous approval of his ministers, many of whom had been lobbying privately for him to take the step. A commission had also been advocated by the Bar Association, by a group of former Israeli ambassadors, by respected intellectuals and by a huge demonstration last Saturday in Tel Aviv at which, according to police estimates, 350,000 people, nearly 10 percent of the country's population, participated."

Unionism's high command is rallying around that declaration of faith on this 100th anniversary of Labor Day. It is the central slogan of the key celebration - the unveiling in Texas of a monument to Samuel Gompers, founding father of the American Federation of Labor. But this exercise in ancestor worship is itself an ironic reflection of the cross pulls between barnacled tradition and the need for change that make the union movement's future health decidedly problematical.   The Gompers gospel of ''more'' as the main function of unionism has become a shaky proposition in a year when many unions find it necessary to settle for less under the hammer blows of mass unemployment, savage trade competition and the threatened extinction of highly unionized industries that had been traditional frontrunners in wages and benefits.   The new realism forced on the bargaining table by these pressures is bringing some electrifying moves away from adversarial relationships between management and labor, especially in the direction of joint problem-solving and shared authority at the shop level. But atavistic hostilities remain so ingrained that every advance toward greater cooperation for mutual survival is in constant danger of being wrecked by some clumsy misstep or by adverse developments elsewhere in the recession-mired economy."

But the deadline seems to have slipped. And so there has been no cease-fire declared in the shadowy 16-year-old bush war between South Africa's forces and the insurgents of the South-West Africa People's Organization fighting to make the land their own.   Western negotiators mediating between the combatants initially mentioned Aug. 15 as a target date when they began in early June what in their assessment was their most promising initiative yet to bring about a settlement."

They said ''no final decision'' had been made on whether to go ahead with a planned delivery to Israel on Monday of 4,000 rounds of cluster munitions designed for use in 155-millimeter howitzers.   Some Administration officials said, however, that they anticipated at least a delay since they doubted that the review would be concluded by Monday."

Stock volume was the second largest on record. Bond prices soared as hopes grew that a recent decline in rates for Treasury bills and other short-term borrowings had spread to the long-term issues. However, the rate decline was attributed not to hopes for recovery but to the persisting recession and the prospect of shrinking demand for business loans. The break in the markets came after Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist, reversed his prediction that rates would rise later this year. (Page A1.)   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 38.81 points to 831.24 in the landmark session. The previous record was set Nov. 1, 1978, when the Dow rose 35.34 points.

That is the heady vision these days of many advertisers and agencies who, long frustrated by European regulation of commercial television, are looking hard at the potential of satellite networks.   Among the agencies taking the hardest look is BBDO International, which a couple of years ago set up an international committee on the newmedia and has been advising clients on appropriate marketing strategies.   ''The satellite as a mass broadcast phenomenon in Europe is five years away,'' said William Wilson, executive vice president. However, he added, satellites are already broadcasting for a few hours each day in parts of Scandinavia and will soon come to Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands. In a clash between regulations and technology, the BBDO people predict, technology will triumph."

As the Federal Reserve aggressively bought Treasury securities last week to supply credit to the banking system, traders could be led to conclude that the Fed had eased its monetary policy. The prospect of an easier monetary policy with lower short-term rates was enough to change market psychology and, for the time being, replace the fear that record amounts of Treasury borrowing would push rates higher.   Although Treasury note and bond prices are still below the levels of mid-May, last week's gains were sharp. For example, the new 14 7/8 percent notes due in 1986 rose 2 5/8 points, to 103, to yield 13.86 percent, while the 14 percent bonds due in 2011 rose four points, or $40 per $1,000 bond, to 104 1/4, to yield 13.42 percent."

Vast clouds of black smoke rose from the Mazraa quarter and swirls of white smoke rose from sites that were believed to be Palestinian ammunition dumps.   As Israeli tanks, armored personnel carriers and bulldozers moved into the predominantly Moslem section of the capital, the heavy artillery fire intensified. At the same time, Israeli loudspeakers mounted on some of the tanks repeated over and over again in Arabic: ''Run for your lives. Clear the battle zone.''"

Drops Case on G.M.,"  The Federal Trade Commission today dismissed a 1976 case against the General Motors Corporation involving charges that the auto maker's policy of selling repair parts only to its own dealers was unfair.   The ruling overturned a 1979 decision by an administrative law judge, who ruled that G.M.'s practice of selling crash parts - those most commonly damaged in accidents - exclusively to its franchised dealers discriminated against competitors.   Although the commission acknowledged today that competitors were put at a disadvantage, it found the practice had ''business justification.''"

But when it comes to their own personal portfolios, many of them are less eager to participate at present. That's because two of the largest firms that provide personal financial counseling to corporate brass are waving the flag of caution.   At Heublein Inc. last Tuesday, for instance, Guy Palmer, senior vice president of the Ayco Corporation, told senior executives, including the president, Hicks Waldron, that if they still had any money in short-term debt they should keep it there.

The facility where the bodies were taken, once called Andrew Fleming Hospital, is now known as Parirenyatwa, after a black nationalist hero, and the city is Harare, not Salisbury, as it used to be.   The changes of name are tokens of the political reversal that has occurred here since white-ruled Rhodesia became Zimbabwe, Africa's newest black-ruled independent nation, in April 1980, an event that ended 90 years of minority rule.

The chaos of the warfare, the destruction of city neighborhoods and refugee camps, the haste with which bodies were buried in mass graves and the absence of impartial agencies gathering statistics have made a reliable accounting impossible.   It is clear to anyone who has traveled in southern Lebanon, as have many journalists and relief workers, that the original figures of 10,000 dead and 600,000 homeless, reported by correspondents quoting Beirut representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross during the first week of the war, were extreme exaggerations.   It seems equally clear that the much lower figures provided later by the Israelis do not include all the casualties suffered in Lebanon since the operation began June 6."

The agreement, which may come in a meeting later this month, would make it easier for United States authorities to investigate possible securities law violations in Switzerland, sources familiar with the situation say.   While John M. Fedders, the commission's chief enforcement official, will neither confirm nor deny the reports, he says that the agency is making considerable progress on this issue.   Until recently, the Swiss have bristled at any attempts by foreigners to challenge their durable and highly lucrative ways of doing business. Perhaps most vexing to United States officials is the fact that insider trading - trading in stock to make a profit or limit losses on the basis of information not available to the public - is not illegal in Switzerland."

The participation of the marines in the withdrawal of Palestinian forces from the Lebanese capital has been particularly galling to the Russians in the wake of a warning by Leonid I. Brezhnev that Moscow ''will continue to categorically object'' to any United States military presence in Lebanon. The warning, published in Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, went unheeded as Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed on a joint operation by French, Italian and American troops to assist in the Palestinian pullout.   Since Mr. Brezhnev's warning, references to the role of United States troops by senior Soviet officials and commentators in the official press have generally omitted any implication of a Soviet response."

Tandy's business today is essentially limited to Radio Shack, a consumer electronics chain that ranks as one of the greatest retailing successes in history.   In 1963, Tandy, then a leathercraft manufacturer and retailer, acquired the nine consumer electronic stores of the near-bankrupt Radio Shack company in Boston. Today, the Radio Shack chain is an 8,500-store juggernaut that has given Tandy a rate of growth seldom equaled in retailing or elsewhere.

Although the yield on the new notes was well below the 14.68 percent available in the secondary market little more than a month ago, it was higher than the 13.4 percent yield quoted by dealers two days ago.   Analysts said that the modest drop in prices and increase in yields in the past few days had helped attract buyers and made the 13 3/4 percent issue the highest-yielding Treasury security of any maturity.

Differences between the United States and Europe were narrowed at meetings here on Wednesday and today between Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and a European delegation led by Viscount Etienne Davignon, the Commissioner for Industry, and Wilhelm Hafercamp, the E.E.C.'s vice president for External Affairs.   But executives of two leading domestic steel companies said after a briefing with Mr. Baldrige that the new proposals were not acceptable to American steelmakers.   The officials, who declined to be identified, said the Europeans did not commit themselves to a sufficiently large cutback in shipments of most steel products to the American market. The domestic industry wants the Europeans to limit their share of the American market to no more than 5 percent for each kind of product, while the latest European proposals are for a market share of between 5 percent and 6 percent, industry and government sources said."

The rise was within expectations and caused no significant change in interest rates.   In credit market activity before the late-afternoon money supply announcement, however, some short-term rates rose about three-eighths of a percentage point, while note and bond prices fell by threequarters of a point to one and a quarter points, pushing up yields.   Securities dealers said that an increase in their cost of financing, to about 10 3/4 percent from less than 8 percent early in the week, made them more eager to cut prices in an effort to attract buyers for the recent heavy supply of Treasury issues. Last week, the Treasury sold $5.5 billion each of three- and six-month bills, $6 billion of 13 1/8 percent three-year notes, $5 billion of 13 3/4 percent notes due in 1992, and $6.25 billion of one-year bills."

All Facet wants is a judicial ruling that it terminated its pension plan on Nov. 13, 1980, and, in the process, qualified for assistance from the pension agency. But many of the nation's largest corporations - as well as the pension corporation - believe that such a ruling could upset the entire private pension insurance system.   They say that Facet is trying to take advantage of a loophole in the Federal pension law, and unless that loophole is closed, they could wind up footing the bill for some $4.3 billion worth of pension benefits owed by other corporations. 'An Outrageous Loophole'   ''The Facet situation is a perfect illustration of the potential for abuse in the pension law as it's now written,'' said George Pantos, counsel to a group of 112 major corporations that want to see the Federal pension law amended. ''The wording of the law permits companies with unfunded pension liabilities to terminate their plans and have the Government step in and pay the benefits, passing the costs along to other corporations,'' he said.

Mr. Habib met this afternoon with Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan, Foreign Minister Fuad Butros and President Elias Sarkis, reviewing the results of his negotiations Sunday with Israel's Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon, and outlining the ''comprehensive'' withdrawal proposal that he planned to convey to the Israelis.   This evening a senior Lebanese Government official quoted Prime Minister Wazzan as saying that Mr. Habib had passed to Israel a formal proposal for the withdrawal of the 6,000 to 9,000 Palestine Liberation Organization fighters trapped in west Beirut. The official said that if the Israelis accepted the plan - still a major uncertainty -the pullout could begin later this week, possibly Saturday or earlier."

Lifting the sanctions, which were imposed during the Falkland Islands war, would free more than $1 billion in Argentine funds frozen in British banks and would open the way for Argentina to begin making overdue payments on an estimated $5 billion borrowed from British banks. No payment on this debt has been made since the Falkland crisis started last spring, and British bankers say that about $200 million in interest payments is past due.   The British announcement said that lifting the sanctions reflected British concern over Argentina's huge foreign debt and the problems it is having making debt payments on time. The Treasury said it welcomed ''Argentina's current approach to the International Monetary Fund and wishes to facilitate an appropriate early agreement between the Fund and Argentine authorities'' for an emergency I.M.F. loan."

American and Honduran officers say the primary objective of the two-week exercise, which involves United States Air Force and Army units from Panama, is the establishment of a permanent Honduran base at Durzuna, some 25 miles north of the Nicaraguan border.   The base, which the officers say will be the largest in eastern Honduras, is in a pine forest some 45 miles west of this muggy, rundown port village. They say it will be home for an infantry battalion, supported by an artillery battery and an engineering unit. The Hondurans are also constructing an airstrip at Durzuna that will be capable of handling large transport planes and jet fighters, the officers say."

In fact, they are best at tasks that are tough or impossible for people. But give a computer a task that even a child can do - like identifying a horse in a photograph of a meadow - and it shows its ignorance.   Now, however, there is blossoming commercial interest in artificial intelligence, a science devoted to making computers do exactly those common-sense things that they cannot yet do. In fact,, at the recent National Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Pittsburgh--from which the following items were gleened--academicians reporting their latest work were flanked by venture capitalists on the prowl for next year's hot investment. Both groups are hoping that thinking computers will be made even smarter, eventually taking on new tasks--like those performed by doctors or lawyers.   But how smart are computers, really? Recent research shows that they're not yet Einsteins."

One view was that silver was now back to its price of late 1981, when it was still falling from its record level of $50.30, set Jan.  21, 1980.   The other view was that silver took off from that level in the fall of 1979 and didn't stop climbing until it reached its record price.  While not even the most courageous silver bull today thinks the metal will cross the $50 mark in the foreseeable future, two of the major houses in the precious metals industry believe there are enough sound reasons why the metal should interest investors."

Burr, the chairman of People Express Airlines, an expansion-minded carrier based at Newark International Airport, had been looking since fall for landing rights at better airports. In the aftermath of the air controllers' strike, and the resultant squeeze on landing rights at the nation's 22 biggest airports, his fleet of 17 jets had been forced to operate from secondary fields on the fringes of the most desirable transportation markets.   Meanwhile, in Princeton, David A. Van Dyke, the owner and president of the fledgling Princeton Aviation Corporation, a commuter airline that linked the university town to Newark, Boston and Washington, was struggling with the downturn in the economy. Although Princeton had carried an average of 30,000 passengers a year in the four years since its founding, Mr. Van Dyke said the economic downturn had cut into his traffic and led to losses."

Walentas has an affinity for rehabilitating, for residential use, buildings that seem to embody the era in which they were built and the neighborhood's original character.   That trait is evident in two of his restoration efforts: Alwyn Court, the national landmark apartment house at 180 West 58th Street near Central Park, and his forthcoming development of the landmark Fulton Landing site on the Brooklyn waterfront. It is also apparent in a third effort, the Silk Building, at 14 East Fourth Street in the Noho (north of Houston Street) area of lower Manhattan.   East Fourth Street is the northern boundary of the garment manufacturing district that stretches north along Broadway from Houston Street, and the 81-year-old Silk Building's utilitarian but stately facade bespeaks its original use as factory space for producers of fine silk garments."

Selig H. Price, who has always been called Steve, was a top gun in the great General Foods empire before being spirited away by a headhunter working for the new president of Newsweek Inc., Mark M.  Edmiston, and installed as executive vice president of Newsweek Inc., and general manager in charge of the entire business side of the domestic operation, over the publisher, Charles J. Kennedy, but under the president.   It is unique in the business, as far as the memory of Kent Rhodes, president of the Magazine Publishers Association, serves.   Marketing at a magazine, Mr. Price said enthusiastically, means defining ''who is the reader and who is the advertiser and finding out what we can do to satisfy them.''"
