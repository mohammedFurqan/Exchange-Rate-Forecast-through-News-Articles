Nico Smith said, when he learned his first lesson of apartheid: You talk to blacks, his mother told him, only when you have an order to give to them, a command to impart.   The lesson, he says now with a rueful smile, seemed to take root and blossom.   When the Afrikaner National Party came to power in 1948 on a platform of racial separation, he recalls with the same smile, he rejoiced.   He studied in Pretoria and joined the Dutch Reformed Church, which found scriptural justification for apartheid. He was called into the ranks of the secretive and powerful Afrikaner fellowship called the Broederbond. He became a professor in the theology department at the University of Stellenbosch in the Cape, a cradle of Afrikanerdom. In terms of the orthodoxy of his forebears, he had arrived."

We warned the peoples and governments that medicine would be helpless to offer even minimal relief to the hundreds of millions of victims in nuclear war."

At Washington University in St. Louis, parents of entering undergraduates can make a single payment for the full four years' tuition at the rate in effect during the freshman year.   And at the University of Southern California, a tuition installment plan lets families avoid large payments twice a year, by financing the annual tuition bill over a number of months at below-market interest rates.   These are just a few of the ways that families who do not qualify for government-subsidized loans are attempting to meet the escalating expenses of higher education. And with the annual cost of attending college expected to rise an average of 7 percent during the current academic year alone - following increases of 10 to 11 percent in the early 1980's - more parents are taking advantage of such financial devices to handle what might otherwise be an unmanageable expense."

Tisch, the chairman of the Loews Corporation, to join the CBS board.   Now with Mr. Tisch, who can buy up to 25 percent of CBS's stock, watching over his shoulder, Mr. Wyman must grapple with the major challenge of improving CBS's performance. Its core businesses - broadcasting, records and publishing - are facing problems. The company must divest itself of a handful of assets to meet its increased debt. And to complicate matters, a number of Wall Street analysts are skeptical that Mr. Wyman's demonstrated managerial skills can solve those problems.   ''I would give Tom Wyman a B so far,'' said Edward Attorino, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Although his cost-cutting strategy seems to be working, some of it was forced on CBS by the Turner deal and the deterioration in the broadcast business. Secondly, some of the company's diversification moves have not worked out. There had been a belief that CBS would successfully broaden its base, but so far it has not developed a diversification strategy that works.''"

But this year reductions are being offered in fares to many other markets as well because of a growing rivalry between two low-cost carriers: People Express and Continental Airlines.   The rivalry has already led to a fare war that has drawn in one major carrier, United Airlines, which matched some of the lower fares to remain competitive.   Analysts, however, believe that the struggle will not lead to the wide fare wars the industry experienced several years ago, and that the responses by other major carriers will remain limited."

Dr. Fossey, who was 53 years old, was a fierce defender of the mountain gorilla, which she feared would become extinct by the end of the century.   ''She was far more at home with wildlife than with humans,'' an acquaintance in Nairobi, Kenya, said.   The police said that Dr. Fossey's body was found Thursday at the Karisoke Research Institute, which she founded, and that her killers appeared to know the area well. [The Rwanda radio said that there had been no arrests and that an investigation was continuing, The Associated Press reported.]  Friends Suspect Poachers In Nairobi, friends of Dr. Fossey speculated that she might have been killed by the poachers she fought against for so long."

The court also found illegal an arrangement whereby the investment house - Forstmann Little & Company - had exacted a promise that Revlon would not use the Forstmann Little offer to shop around for a better price.   A Delaware lawyer who asked not to be named said that under the ruling the concept of the so-called poison pill, making takeovers extremely expensive, ''may be on the way out.'' He explained that if directors issued such pills, they assumed greater duties than before and thus must negotiate with all parties trying to buy their company."

For three days, several thousand economists, mostly university teachers but with a substantial number of people who work for governments, banks and other corporations and consulting firms, hang around a hotel lobby listening to each other talk. Or at least talking. The official program for this year's meeting, now under way in New York, includes hundreds of formal presentations, most with prepared discussions, and there will be hours of informal conversation.   This year's convention is special in one respect. It marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the American Economic Association. The assembled economists will poke fun at themselves, the way confident professionals often do. They will, in fact, feel pretty good about themselves. The truth is: they have quite a lot to feel good about. In contrast with other academic fields, there are still teaching jobs in economics for new Ph.D.'s. To a profession that tends to take the market seriously, that is itself a very good sign."

The sports-luxury cars, sharing the same basic body and platforms, are the Cadillac Seville, with a suggested retail price of $26,756, 15 percent over the 1985 price; the Cadillac Eldorado, $24,251, up nearly 16 percent; the Oldsmobile Toronado, $19,418, up 15.6 percent, and the Buick Riviera, $19,831, up 18.7 percent. Clifford Merriott, a GM spokesman, said the increases were justified because the company redesigned the cars ''from roof to road and from front to back.''"

Under his plan, called the ''alternative maximum tax,'' taxpayers who voluntarily elected to give up virtually all tax benefits would be able to have their taxes computed on a much lower rate schedule than those who continue to take advantage of the variety of tax deductions, credits and exemptions available under current law."

The report, one of the most thorough independent studies ever made of the Chinese economy, offers a strong endorsement of the pragmatic policies of Deng Xiaoping, the 81-year-old Communist Party leader who has been in control since 1978. One of the report's central themes is a call for still greater play for market forces, decentralization and foreign investment, the cornerstones of Mr. Deng's approach. The report urged greater use of the marketplace to ''stimulate innovation and efficiency'' through cost cutting and quality control.   At the same time, the 183-page document, which was released late last week, strikes a cautionary note on a number of issues, including Mr. Deng's goal of catching up with the economic standards of the leading Western nations by the middle of the 21st century. The report states that this will require annual growth in per capita income - currently at about $300, on a par with Haiti - of as much as 6.5 percent. According to the report, only two relatively small nations, Greece and South Korea, have approximated such rapid growth since 1960."

For all of 1984, the regional increase was 4.8 percent. The regional index is not adjusted for seasonal variations."

They also demonstrate little appreciation for the rights and obligations of employers who establish and maintain voluntary retirement plans for their employees.   Defined benefit plans provide for the most secure retirement for workers. They are unquestionably the most expensive for an employer to maintain; the employer assumes all the risks of investment losses and adverse mortality and employment experience. The employer funds the plan based on actuarial assumptions which can result in excess plan assets at termination, or in underfunding, for which the employer may be liable in whole or in part at plan termination. The more conservative the assumptions, and the more responsible the funding, the greater the chance of excess assets at termination."

My own conclusion, after an examination of a full cycle of recession and recovery, is a bit different. While I do not dispute the general disinflationary effects of high unemploymentrates, falling materials prices and a rising dollar, I do believe the contribution of these factors to disinflation has been vastly overstated. In particular, I found that the mere stabilization of the dollar at its 1980 value and of oil and farm prices at historically high levels would have been enough to bring inflation down substantially."

The industry was dismayed by the plan advanced by the Treasury Department last winter - which proposed eliminating many of the oil industry's tax incentives, including write-offs of intangible drilling costs - and was only somewhat mollified when the White House later revised the proposal to reinstitute the most valued of those breaks, such as the intangible drilling cost exemption.

When a government takes private property, according to the Constitution, it must compensate the owner.   The owners in this case lost. The court ruled that, as long as the property had other viable uses, ''downzoning'' was not equivalent to condemnation. This case is another example of the changes that have occurred since the concept of condemnation, or eminent domain, was developed centuries ago. The terms refer to the right of a government body to acquire a private individual's land for a public purpose, as long as it makes an appropriate payment."

Mr. Papandreou said Friday, in a talk whose full text was made public today, that the armed forces, although loyal to democracy and the Constitution, still contained seeds from the seven years of military dictatorship and would continue to for many years.   He also warned of unspecified foreign forces that might create tension for their own advantage, saying:   ''We must not forget but must always bear in mind that the forces of reaction, which were deeply disappointed by the results of the June 2 elections - such forces exist inside and outside Greece - might be in a position to create step by step, and at the same time take advantage of, an extended atmosphere of insecurity and chaos like that of 1965-66.''   Labor unions have held a continuing wave of strikes to protest austerity measures put into effect last month. They include a curtailment of automatic wage increases tied to rises in the cost of living. The unrest has presented Mr. Papandreou with the most serious internal challenge since his election in 1981 and re-election last June. It has led to defections of labor leaders from the Socialist Party's position and their expulsion from the party."

True, the currency is down about 18 percent, on a trade weighted basis, from its February peak, with most of the slide coming since Sept. 22, when the United States, Japan, France, Britain and West Germany announced they would intervene by selling dollars in international markets to lower the currency's value.   And the group's agreement did slow Congress's drive for protectionist legislation - a delay that ''temporarily reduced the downside risks for the economy,'' said Mr. Yardeni.

Spurred by a decline in interest rates, the index of 30 industrials rose 6.84 points yesterday, to a new closing high of 1,375.57. The former record of 1,369.29 was set just two weeks ago.   The inclusion of the two new companies in the index of 30 companies is the result of the removal of two others. The General Foods Corporation was dropped because of its acquisition by Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker and a leading producer of beer and soft drinks. McDonald's, the dominant force in the fast-food industry, was substituted for American Brands Inc., in part to avoid overweighting the Dow with tobacco-oriented companies. These moves are intended to reflect more accurately price trends in the broader stock market."

The Soviet-backed leaders of Afghanistan have not permitted visits by Western reporters to the Government side of the front.   The Russians have said repeatedly that they will negotiate with the existing Communist Government in Kabul on a withdrawal of Soviet troops only after Western and other aid to the rebels is cut off.   Rebel leaders are unanimous in saying that the Russians, estimated at 118,000 troops, must withdraw to the last man and tank and that they will not accept any formula that would keep the Communist Government in place. The rebels say that if any attempt is made to impose a diplomatic solution on them, they will fight on alone. They say they believe a long struggle lies ahead."

The new, lower intelligence agency estimate of the bomber's range raises questions about the Administration's decision to treat the Backfire as part of Moscow's long-range nuclear arsenal in the Geneva talks.

Since July, its factories have been shut down two days a month, paychecks of most of the company's 85,000 employees have been reduced and hiring any new employee requires highest-level approval.   But in a new, low-slung building in Cupertino, Calif., more than 800 people have been working full weeks and even on Saturdays and actively hiring new workers. They are racing against the clock to come out with an entirely new line of computers, code-named Spectrum, that could change the way computers are designed and almost certainly will change Hewlett-Packard's fortunes.   For Hewlett-Packard, one of the premier companies in the electronics industry and the company that founded Silicon Valley, is engaged in the biggest gamble of its 46-year history. ''If Spectrum doesn't make it, it's devastating,'' said Rich Edwards, a former Hewlett-Packard strategic planner who is now an analyst with Robertson, Colman and Stephens in San Francisco."

The merger mania has sent stock prices to levels no one ever envisioned for 1985. But in the process, American business has gone heavily into debt to pay for its multi-billion dollar takeovers. And this boom in corporate debt, particularly with its use of high-yielding, less-than-investment grade ''junk bonds,'' is bringing warnings even from those involved in financing the megadeals.   ''I'm worried about what this leveraging up will do,'' said Thomas S. Johnson, president of the Chemical Bank, which despite Mr. Johnson's concern participates in takeover lending. ''I'm worried that the aggregate of all these things, including leveraged buy-outs, is simply Some of the players in 1985's deals, Page 7 a perverse result of greed and not a logical, rational thing.

Analysts dismissed the increase as a one-month phenomenon that did not change the good prospects for low inflation this year and next.   Even with the big October gain in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, prices for the first 10 months of 1985 have risen at an annual rate of only nine-tenths of 1 percent, bettering last year's 1.7 percent performance.      Attributed to Auto Factor    The October rise came after a decline of six-tenths of 1 percent in September. The swings in both months were attributed primarily to the same factor, changes in new-car prices. In September, attractive cut-rate financing incentives offered at the end of the model year helped slash car prices 3.8 percent. Most of those incentives were discontinued last month with the introduction of 1986 models, resulting in a sharp 5.1 percent price increase."

Would a space- and land-based shield against missiles offer meaningful protection to the United States? Or, even if it were to become scientifically plausible, would it, instead, weaken America's military power?   Most experts agree that present and prospective Soviet actions will bear heavily on the answers.   But whatever those answers are they will be crucial to what Lieut. Gen. James A.

The predisposition in favor of lower interest rates was shown on Friday, when traders and investors shrugged off a Commerce Department report of stronger-than-expected gains in employment. Normally, a 414,000 rise in nonfarm payrolls, plus a strong increase in manufacturing employment, would have led to lower bond prices as analysts concluded that a stronger economy would bring stronger credit demands and discourage the Fed from any further easing in monetary policy.   But on Friday the sharp price declines registered after release of the employment statistics were quickly recouped, and bond prices ended the day with modest gains. ''There was heavy, broad-based buying when prices fell in the morning,'' said one Government securities dealer.

Such an approach, he explained at a news conference, would be aimed at defusing criticism that the Government provides extra protection to large deposits of major banks even when those deposits do not fall under Federal insurance guidelines.   Separately, Beryl W. Sprinkel, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said here at the annual convention of the American Bankers Association that the economy would grow at roughly a 5 percent annual rate in the second half of 1985.   The prediction was consistent with Mr. Sprinkel's most recent forecast, but the fact that he chose to reassert it today suggests that the Administration might be trying to refute some private economists who say it is virtually impossible that the economy will grow at 5 percent in the second half."

The four-year, $685 billion accumulation of deficits now exceeds all previous deficits, less periodic surpluses, of the 20th century.   Economists have bewailed such figures since 1981, when Congress and the Reagan Administration ordered income tax cuts without making corresponding cuts in spending. But, for polticians, the budget deficit has been one of those problems, like the condition of the nation's bridges or the proliferation of toxic wastes, that seem too big or too remote to deal with."

Now 52 years old and an honored member of the literary establishment, Mr. Yevtushenko had again taken the mantle of rebel and critic to demand that the candor and openness Mikhail S.

''Today's long-awaited striving for change for the better in our country gives us profound hopes that self-flattery will be forever rejected, and that nonconcealment will become the norm of civic behavior,'' he said.

Meanwhile, the Tax Reform Action Coalition, an ad hoc group of corporations and industry groups including the General Motors Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation, declared its support for the House tax package.

The Ministry of Defense, in what was seen by diplomats as an effort to distance itself from the assertion, said later that the remarks ''do not express the thought of the Government.''   But Western diplomats here said the consensus among intelligence officials was that Iran had indeed played a role in training the terrorists."

Most of these questions revolve around the degree of ministerial responsibility for Israel's purported espionage operation in Washington.   To put it simply: Was this reported spying affair an act of the Israeli Government, or was it the work of a ''loose cannon'' in Israel's intelligence apparatus?   The answer to this question relates to the even larger issue of American-Israeli relations: Was the Israeli Government, as a Government, involved in a potentially hostile act against the United States, its closest ally?      U.S.-Israeli Relationship    Or, was a senior Israeli official acting on his own initiative running an espionage mission in the United States unbeknownst to the Israeli Cabinet?   In addition, the espionage affair raises the issue of the precise character of the American-Israeli relationship. Is it a relationship purely between two sovereign nations or is it a relationship between members of the same family?"

The World Future Society, a nonprofit scientific and educational association based in Bethesda, Md., offers these forecasts of consumer goods to come: Custom-made clothes will be made in minutes. A video camera will scan a customer's body and tell a computer the shape, style, color and design of the clothing. The fabric will then be shaped around three-dimensional molds and heated to retain human contours. (But what about the buttons? What about the zippers?) A week's vacation in a space station or a honeymoon on the moon will become commonplace. (Let me slip out of this spacesuit into something more comfortable.) Butlers and other servants will make a comeback - but they will be computers and robots. One computer system already available speaks with a polite British accent, draws water for the bath, mixes cocktails and waters the lawn. (But it won't do windows, balance checkbooks or write columns.) Among other developments predicted by the society are growth hormones for turning children into basketball or football stars, home delivery of groceries with the help of computerized navigation systems and, as the population distribution changes, more elderly criminals."

SCM said the offer was intended to protect shareholders in the event of the failures of two competing offers - a $75-a-share bid by Hanson Trust P.L.C. of London and a $74-a-share management buyout proposed by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.   SCM stressed, however, that if either Hanson or Merrill were successful in buying the company, its own offer would be withdrawn.   Analysts noted that if SCM did buy two-thirds of its stock, Hanson, which owns the rest, would then have a stake in a heavily indebted company."

After netting out the impact of inflation, this debt has been growing at a dizzying pace of 8.6 percent a year in 1984 and 1985, compared with 2.7 percent annually from 1975 to 1983. Corporate debt now exceeds the total net worth of corporations by 12 percent.   To many observers, this corporate debt is no cause for concern. It merely reflects the strong investment boom we have experienced in the recent economic recovery. Indeed, some suggest that it is a sign of strength - of an economy responding to President Reagan's economic policies; of corporations borrowing to invest in modern plant and equipment; and of confidence among financial institutions that the debt can easily be paid off."

The signing took place in Damascus, Syria, under the supervision of Syria's First Vice President, Abdel Halim Khaddam, who had been the broker at three months of negotiations among the armed factions that have been fighting one another since 1975.   The agreement was signed by Nabih Berri, the leader of the mainstream Shiite Moslem movement called Amal; his ally, Walid Jumblat, who is head of the mostly Druse Progressive Socialist Party, and Elie Hobeika, the commander of the powerful Christian militia known as the Lebanese Forces.   ''It is all over,'' Mr. Berri told reporters, alluding to the civil war that in effect partitioned the country into fiefdoms controlled by militia heads, who virtually replaced the central Government in power."

They accuse her of cheating them, and she wishes them a nice day.

''I was really shocked,'' Miss Ribaudo said. ''I'm not ashamed to be a teller.''   Miss Ribaudo, who is 18 years old, has been a teller for about 5 months at Citibank's headquarters branch at Park Avenue and 53d Street. As such, she is in banking's trenches. One of the favorite complaints of New Yorkers is the incompetence, indifference or downright impertinence of the tellers where they bank. But the tellers have a complaint, too: that banking brings out the worst in many New Yorkers.   ''The first thing you learn in teller training is that there are people who come in here, they're angry, they can't count money, they take it out on you,'' said Miss Ribaudo, who underwent two weeks of classroom instruction in a mock banking setup and two days of on-the-job training.

The humiliation of Egypt, they said, was intensified by America's unconcealed jubilation over the interception of the Egyptair Boeing 737 and lingering Egyptian fury over what was seen here as the Reagan Administration's condoning of Israel's air attack on the Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters in Tunis two weeks ago.   ''Egypt has lost almost everything since 1967, the year of its war with Israel - its wealth, its military prowess, its traditional leadership of the Arab world,'' said one Arab diplomat here today. ''Almost everything has been taken from Egypt,'' he said, except its dignity and self-esteem.   Western and Arab officials interviewed here in the last few days said that in addition to trying to salvage some of his country's self-esteem, Mr. Mubarak's harsh denunciation of the United States was also aimed at protecting his political flanks from internal criticism stemming from Egypt's ties to the United States and his handling of the hijacking episode."

For more than a year, foreign visitors have been aware of young Chinese women engaging in prostitution in and around the big-city hotels where foreigners stay, particularly in the southern city of Canton. But it is only in the last week that the practice has been publicly condemned by party leaders.   The issue has strong political connotations. The tens of thousands of prostitutes in pre-1949 China were regarded by the Communists as a symptom of the country's degradation, and their elimination was hailed as a symbol of the new, wholesome society ordained by Mao Zedong. Their return has been seized on by some party leaders as a fresh and particularly unpalatable example of the dangers of allowing the ''taint'' of Western ''money grubbing'' influence into the country."

And if that advertiser was interested in reaching only the segment that is responsive to direct marketing, Gerard Calabrese, the publisher, can be particularly obliging in that area too, thanks to technical advances made by his printer, R.

The G.A.O., the investigative arm of Congress, pointed to inadequate staffing, noting that some people put in 80-hour weeks, and a change-over to a new computer system as the primary reasons for what Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, said today was ''the worst tax-filing season in history.''"

The director, Lieut. Gen. James A.

General Abrahamson also disclosed for the first time that the Pentagon had recentlly destroyed a mock-up of a Soviet SS-18 missile booster with a hardened plastic pellet fired at tremendous velocity.

That group split up in 1983 into two factions, one loyal to and one against Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization umbrella group. Experts say that makes it hard to identify who is really behind the hijacking of the Italian ship.   The faction that remained loyal to Mr. Arafat is headed by Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas. Now a member of the P.L.O.'s executive committee, he is famous among Palestinians for his creativity in devising raids against Israel, including at least two spectacular, but unsuccessful, air attacks in 1981."

One year, the couple recalls, the boys bought their father a set of reindeer-tipped swizzle sticks; their mother got two cookie cutters, one shaped like a ship, the other a whale.   The Pieper children pay for their gifts with money they earn during the year by cutting grass, taking out the garbage and babysitting for their younger sister. This is one popular approach to allowances: linking the weekly stipend to the performance of household chores. The other main school of thought holds that all generations of a family share household chores, or ought to, and allowances should not be linked to this family function. According to this viewpoint, children have a right to pocket money, but they are too young to be required to earn it as wages."

On a separate matter, General Zia reiterated his pledge to sign the treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons and to open his country's nuclear plants to international safeguards and inspection if India agreed to do the same. He said a regional policy was necessary to deal with the nuclear abilities of the two countries."

A lack of supply in the Treasury market, hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon ease its monetary policy and the prospects for Congressional action to reduce Federal budget deficits were all cited by analysts as reasons for the decline in note and bond yields.   Although many market participants doubt that those three reasons justify continued declines in interest rates, their skepticism did not discourage investors or prevent the price of the bellwether 10 5/8 percent Treasury bond due in 2015 from gaining more than 7/8 point on the day, to an offered price of 105 18/32, to yield 10.03 percent. The closely watched 30-year issue traded as high as about 105 25/32 to yield 10.01 percent - a far cry from the Oct. 28 close of 101 to yield 10.51 percent."

Significantly, this turnabout has coincided with sustained and vivid coverage of South Africa by American television.   Funerals and riots, overturned cars aflame and armored vehicles rolling through black townships have all become familiar images. The names of Bishop Desmond M. Tutu, the Anglican leader who opposes apartheid, and P. W. Botha, the South African President, have practically become household names. Calls for disinvestment and sanctions have sounded with wider and more foreful emphasis in recent months from campuses to Congress. In both the power it exerts and the controversy it excites, the television coverage of South Africa bears comparison to the reporting by broadcast journalism on the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War."

In a special preview Friday, Gerard Smith, Newsweek's publisher and former agency man, said that the changes had been made in response to reader needs, because of the changing competitive environment and to take advantage of new production technology.   Coincidentally, the cover design is being changed, at a time when Newsweek is running about 3 percent behind last year's levels on newsstand sales. And the entire inside of the magazine has been redesigned in a way that should increase readers per copy, a month and a half after Newsweek became the first major publication to base its advertising rates on total audience, rather than on circulation.

The incentives were Japan's latest response to increasing world pressure to reduce its large trade and capital surpluses. Since September, Japan and the other leading industrial nations, the United States, Britain, France and West Germany, known as the Group of Five, have been intervening in world currency markets to bring down the strength of the dollar, considered one of the causes of Japan's surplus.   But many economists believe that intervention is only a short-term solution, and so Japan also agreed to spur economic growth. In this way, Japanese consumers would have more to spend on imports, businesses would invest more at home and Japan could derive more growth from its domestic market rather than exports. $19 Billion in Growth Japan's package offered incentives to build more houses, expand consumer credit, increase local government spending on public works and improve electricity and gas services. The Government estimated that the measures would generate about $19 billion in economic growth over the next year, expanding the gross national product by 1.27 percent."

In fact, 15 states have ''incentive'' rate programs covering about 35 reactors that let the utilities earn more if their nuclear plants operate reliably, and less if they are shut down for refueling and repairs for long periods.   But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is growing increasingly nervous that the incentives for reliability may stop utilities from shutting reactors for necessary maintenance. ''This so-called incentive plan,'' wrote John T. Collins, an N.R.C. regional administrator, in an internal memorandum, ''may actually be a disincentive plan insofar as public health and safety is concerned.''   Such concern prompted the N.R.C. to study the relationship between utility finances and reactor performance last summer. ''Economic regulation can influence the spirit with which a licensee approaches reactor safety issues,'' that study concluded. ''Short-term economic interest may cause utilities to hurry work, take short cuts, or delay action in order to meet a deadline, a cost limitation, or other factors.''"

But beyond the dispute are more fundamental questions about whether a path to missile defense could bring about grave counteractions by the Soviet Union, ranging from repudiation of the treaty obligation to an accelerated military buildup.   The debate within the Administration has centered on the 1972 treaty limiting the development of antiballistic missile defense systems. The dispute has arisen over a new contention by some officials that the United States should interpret the pact as permitting virtually any level of field testing and even ''development'' of advanced antimissile devices.   Other officials think it is enough to rest on the already prevailing argument that the ''Star Wars'' program is designed to defer development and testing of a kind that might violate the treaty."

This last weekend, the Center for Economic Development of Williams College marked its 25th anniversary by bringing together 80 economists and public officials from developed and developing countries, many of them trained at Williams, to appraise the successes and failures of development economics - and to think about where the field should go from here, if it is to help cure the poverty of nations.   The easy optimism of the early postwar period is gone. That optimism was based on the belief that the difference between rich and poor countries was simply that the rich had enormously greater amounts of capital per unit of labor than the poor, and that the key to development was to speed up the rate of capital formation."

Although prices were little changed after the Federal Reserve's late afternoon announcement of a $4.4 billion rise in the M-1 money supply measure for the week of Nov. 25, the money supply data are attracting more attention than earlier in the year. The latest week's increase was widely anticipated and was attributed in part to a computer failure at the Bank of New York on Nov. 22, which caused that bank to borrow more than $20 billion from the Federal Reserve.   But some economists said there are signs, beyond technical factors, indicating that rapid money supply growth has resumed, after a lull in October. Donald Fine, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank who manages a widely followed survey of bank deposits used to predict money supply changes, said preliminary data suggest that the money supply figures next week could show a rise of about $3.5 billion. Some, but not all, of next week's increase could be attributed to unusual deposit flows brought on by Thanksgiving falling late in the month, immediately followed by a Friday that was the last business day of the month."

For years research on these jets, also known as supersonic-combustion ramjets, has bubbled along in Federal research laboratories on a shoestring budget. Then three weeks ago the President's science adviser and the chief of research and development for the Air Force disclosed that they were ready to commit a half-billion dollars over the next three years to refinement of the engine technology, in hopes of developing a plane that could cross the country in 12 minutes and circle the globe in 90.   If the effort works, it could mark the most significant change in airplane design since the invention of the jet. Air Force officials say scramjets may make it possible for a plane to take off from an ordinary runway and quickly accelerate to Mach 12 or even Mach 25. With the aid of an on-board rocket booster, the plane could even propel itself into orbit, paving the way for a new, less expensive way of launching and retrieving satellites."

The city, located at the edge of the central plains, is a natural gateway for routing business travelers to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and beyond, to Asia.   Yet Robert L. Crandall, the shrewd and cocky chairman of American's parent, the AMR Corporation, balked recently at the prospect of buying a ready-made base in Denver. Despite a war chest of $1.3 billion in cash, he sat by as People Express bought Frontier Airlines, the largest Denver-based carrier, for nearly $300 million.   Mr. Crandall has by no means lost interest in Denver. But, with American's two-tier wage contracts in place, with its cost per seat mile of capacity among the lowest of the major carriers, and with its cash flow high, the airline is increasingly finding it cheaper to move into new markets with its own planes and crews. American has already earmarked $6 billion over the next five years to add 160 planes to its current fleet of 290 - an expenditure that Mr. Crandall expects will turn out to be a prime cost-cutting move. ''It is that principle of low costs that drives us toward internal growth,'' he said."

Shultz said today.   Expressing high-level concern for the first time about a potentially touchy situation with the Soviet Union as he goes to Moscow for talks with Soviet leaders, Mr. Shultz said the United States had protested about the harassment at the embassy.   In a news conference held as he flew here from Washington on his way to Helsinki, the first leg of his Moscow mission, Mr. Shultz and other officials provided many more details about the incident than the State Department made known on Friday.   An aide to Mr. Shultz said the secretary had personally protested to Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador, about the threatening moves around the embassy in Afghanistan on Thursday. The United States regards the Afghan troops as taking orders from the Soviet military command, which has more than 100,000 soldiers in Afghanistan."

They exempted small contractors from more onerous accounting methods. And they provided small corporations with a more generous tax rate schedule than President Reagan had proposed and endorsed the idea of a new tax credit for small manufacturers."

The officials appeared at a late-evening briefing at Gander International Airport, where the chartered plane had stopped to refuel on its flight from Egypt via West Germany to Fort Campbell, Ky., where the servicemen were returning home.   John Pitman, the airport manager, provided a detailed timetable of the flight's stopover for one hour and seven minutes at Gander. But when he was asked whether the DC-8 had been de-iced, Mr. Pitman said, ''I will leave that for someone else to answer.''"

They chatted jovially before speaking to about 300 journalists at a brief closing ceremony. But they conceded that ''serious differences remain on a number of crucial issues.''"

The decision to try to form a Marxist-Leninist party represents the first time the rebel military Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front has publicly defined itself as a Marxist movement.   The shift appears to reflect an ideological hardening among the rebels, as well as a narrowing of their public appeal and of the political forces that they once hoped would support them.   The decision is one of the strongest indications yet of the growing distance between the five factions that make up the rebel military front and the handful of small social democratic parties that have been allied to them for five years under the banner of the Democratic Revolutionary Front.   The social democratic parties have had an increasingly troubled relationship with the armed guerrilla groups. The Democratic Revolutionary Front has consistently defined itself as a supporter of political pluralism, and its senior officials say they will not join the Marxist-Leninist party the rebels hope to form."

STAY,"  President Habib Bourguiba was reported today be at odds with most of his key advisers over whether to allow the Palestine Liberation Organization to keep its political headquarters here.   According to diplomats and Tunisian and Palestinian officials, Mr. Bourguiba has argued that the P.L.O. presence is a source of trouble for the country. The sources said he cited the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro last week and the Israeli bombing of the P.L.O. headquarters here Oct. 1 in which about 70 Palestinians and Tunisians were killed.   But almost his entire Cabinet - angered at the United States for its endorsement, later qualified, of the bombing and for its interception of an Egyptian plane carrying the hijackers of the ship - is arguing instead for cooler relations with Washington and closing ranks with the Arab world, the sources said."

The raid, the first Israeli attack on foreign soil outside of Lebanon since 1981, was in retaliation for the killing last Wednesday of three Israelis aboard a yacht in Larnaca, Cyprus, Mr. Rabin said at a news conference.   Israel knew that Yasir Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was in Tunisia, said Lieut. Gen. Moshe Levy, the Israeli chief of staff, at the same news conference. But he would not say if Israel had specifically tried to kill Mr. Arafat. P.L.O. spokesmen said Mr. Arafat was not hurt in the raid."

The Departments of Justice, Treasury, Labor and Commerce - along with the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers - questioned the Federal Reserve's legal authority to apply margin requirement rules to takeovers financed with the bonds.   The Administration was apparently angered by the proposal, taking the view that the Federal Reserve was trying to slow the rash of corporate takeovers. Today's action represents their strongest disagreement over the working of a free marketplace. It also represented an unusually broad attack marshaled by the Administration."

Although the number of those who have recently emigrated cannot be precisely established, Israeli officials say they believe that more and more young Israelis have been leaving the country to look for work abroad, and that many will not come back even if Israel's economy recovers.   Up-to-date figures are unavailable, the officials involved in emigration matters said, because an emigrant is defined by the Central Bureau of Statistics as an Israeli who has lived abroad for at least four years.   ''There is an atmosphere of an economic catastrophe and this atmosphere has pushed people to emigrate,'' said Dov Shilansky, a Likud Member of Parliament who is involved with emigration issues. The rate of unemployment in Israel is etsimated to be at least 6 percent of the work force, and it is expected to rise in the coming months as a result of planned large-scale layoffs."

But officials who took part in the talks between President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said they did not discuss ways to finance the projects.   In a significant gesture, Mr. Mitterrand said France would reverse a recent decision and take part in the development of a joint European fighter plane to be developed and built by West Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain. What is important, he added, ''is the symbolic value'' of France's participation. Discussing the French role in the plane's development, the French President told a news conference that ''I have thought of 10 percent; if not 10 percent, it could be as little as 5 percent.''"

In its statement the Congress also called for the resignation of President P. W. Botha, the nationalization of the country's mines, the withdrawal of troops from segregated black townships and the abolition of the so-called pass laws that limit blacks' access to white areas.

I have also asked our negotiators to seek Soviet agreement to extend this round of the negotiations into next week so that our negotiating team can make a full presentation of our proposal and have a real give-and-take with the Soviets on its details.   Finally, I have written to the leaders of allied nations and have transmitted a personal letter to General Secretary Gorbachev on this subject. History has shown that progress is more surely made through confidential negotiations. Therefore, I'm not going into any details about our proposal. Suffice to say that our proposal is serious, it is detailed and it addresses all three areas of the negotiations. It builds upon the very concrete reductions proposals which our negotiators had tabled earlier as well as the Soviet counterproposal."

The trick is to ferret out potential winners after a company files for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.   The aim of Chapter 11 is to protect a company from lawsuits while it works out a plan to repay its debt. Under the wing of the bankruptcy court, a company can continue operating while attempts are made to resolve its problems."

Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, took that step in May in response to the Reagan Administration's decision to begin operation of Radio Marti, an anti-Castro radio station.   A proclamation signed by Mr. Reagan bars the entry of Cuban Government and Communist Party officials unless they are coming exclusively to conduct business at the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, the Cuban Mission to the United Nations in New York or the United Nations itself."

The war and the fears of spreading terrorism in the Middle East were the major topics at the sixth meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, officials and diplomats said.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, according to Western and Middle Eastern diplomats and specialists here.   Administration officials and Congressional sources said recently that President Reagan had approved a covert plan aimed at weakening the Libyan Government.   But the diplomats and experts said they questioned whether such a plan could succeed, despite their view that the Libyan leader appeared to be at one of his most vulnerable points in his 16-year rule.   ''The fact that this plan has been made public automatically decreases the chances of success,'' said Pierre Lellouche, deputy director of the Paris-based French Institute of International Relations."

In particular, the apology has touched off discussion on the appropriate response when a foreign court challenges the editorial freedom of a United States news organization publishing abroad. It has also focused scrutiny on the degree of press freedom in Singapore.   On Nov. 19, Fred Zimmerman, editor and publisher of The Asian Wall Street Journal, apologized to the High Court in Singapore for any contempt of court caused by an editorial that appeared Oct. 17. The apology came at a hearing on contempt charges, prompted by the editorial, against The Asian Wall Street Journal and several other parties. The case is still pending."

The feeling is most outspoken in this capital of Slovenia, the republic with the highest living levels.   Because jealousies among the Yugoslav republics make standard-of-living comparisons political dynamite, only estimates are given. Stanislav Valant, executive vice president of Ljubljanska Banka, said Slovenia was 50 percent or more above the national average, and Croatia 10 to 15 percent. Slovenia's per capita gross product is six times greater than that of Kosovo, the Albanian-minority region in the south."

The dream seemed secure.   Now, the Lows have joined countless others who have been rudely awakened by the downward spiral of Texas's once-booming economy. Mr. Low lost his job and his wife's salary could not meet the bills.

With that in mind, investors yesterday stampeded into the equities market, sending the Dow up 12.50 points, to a record close of 1,511.70. The blue-chip average of the stocks of 30 of the biggest United States companies had briefly exceeded the 1,500 level on several occasions in the last few weeks but never finished above it."

It consists of some eight square blocks, from 59th Street to the south side of 62d Street, and from York Avenue almost to Second Avenue. And although it contains dozens of residential buildings - mostly five-story brick walk-ups - it is considered by the city to be a commercial rather than residential district.   That means that all the residential buildings in the bridge zone are at least 25 years old, and most are far older - they were in place when the city adopted its current zoning in 1961. Because of the zoning, no new residential buildings can be constructed."

The array of opinions turned up by a spot check of corporate officials and their representatives in Washington depended largely on how the tax plan affected the self-interest of their companies and their views on how it would change the business environment.   ''Those organizations that represent the capital-intensive sector of the economy will be pretty opposed to it, and those that are inventory-intensive, labor-intensive and thought-intensive will be for it,'' said John M. Albertine, president of the American Business Conference, a lobbying group that represents about 100 mid-sized companies. Heavy industry generally makes up the capital-intensive sector."

But the manager of the Acorn Fund, a no-load growth fund that specializes in emerging companies, is not sentimental when it comes to investing. He shuns the stocks of the American automobile companies, for instance, and has invested in Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru cars and trucks.   More often than not, Mr. Wanger, 51 years old and the manager of the Acorn Fund for 15 years, likes to hunt obscure, smaller-than-average companies because they tend to outperform the market. ''The theory is,'' he said, ''that although these stocks tend to grow faster, they have a lot of volatility. Someone buying stock in just one or two of these small companies could very easily come up with a bad experience. By owning stock in many companies, we hope the disasters will average out.''   In fact, Mr. Wanger has done better than ''average out.'' The $269 million Acorn Fund in the past 10 years has returned 22.4 percent on a compound annual basis, good enough to rank among the top 25 funds in the industry."

The collapse of the 26-month-old coalition Cabinet led by Prime Minister Bettino Craxi produced one of the most dramatic days in Italian politics in several years.   The Prime Minister was forced to resign after Giovanni Spadolini, the Defense Minister, pulled his Republican Party out of the Government on Wednesday to protest its handling of the hijacking and its decision to free Mohammed Abbas, a Palestinian guerrilla sought by the United States.   The United States also condemned Mr. Craxi's decision to release Mr. Abbas.      Final Cabinet Meeting    After a final Cabinet meeting today, which the Republicans did not attend, Mr. Craxi made his address and then drove to the Presidential Palace to hand his resignation to President Francesco Cossiga."

But analysts were divided yesterday over whether falling prices for crude, touched off by OPEC's announcement this week that it might engage in a price war, would soon translate into a savings at the pump and for home heating oil.   Some cautioned that dealers and refiners would cling tenaciously to any price break on the spot petroleum and commodities markets before passing it through. Indeed, oil prices recovered somewhat yesterday, creating uncertainty about their ultimate direction. [Page D6.]  No Effect Daniel Lundberg, president of the Lundberg Survey Inc. of North Hollywood, Calif., thinks that changes in the price of crude often have no effect on the price of gasoline at the pump. He plays down the value of formulas showing that a drop of so many dollars in the price of crude automatically results in a decline of so many cents at the pump."

In the past, Alexander's has indicated that it planned to redevelop the site but would keep a smaller store there. Yesterday's announcement did not say when the company would close the store, which, when it was built in 1965, was Manhattan's most expensive in 40 years.   Alexander's said it expected the owners of real estate on the rest of the block to contribute their property to a partnership to redevelop the site. That agreement, expected yesterday, would be submitted to Alexander's board for approval today, the company said."

A key part of the effort, the sources said yesterday, was a proposal by Mr. Icahn to restructure the $24-a-share offer he made to stockholders last Aug. 6. The proposal would lower the cash portion of the offer to about $15 a share, from $19.50, while increasing the amount the shareholders would get in preferred stock.   The carrier's board was expected to meet late last night to consider the proposal. It was not known how potential participants in the financing were being approached."

The disagreement emerged when Mr. Fabius, in what many here characterized as an astonishing gesture for a French Prime Minister, said in the National Assembly that he was ''personally troubled'' that Mr. Mitterrand met here Wednesday with the Polish leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.   Mr. Fabius's critical remarks on Wednesday seemed highly unusual in a country where the Prime Minister presumably serves at the pleasure of the President. They also added to an impression widely held in this country that the Socialists, facing likely defeat in parliamentary elections in March, have been floundering as they have tried to reverse a decline in popularity."

The alternative, he is being told, is to be dropped from the Middle East peace initiative being pressed by King Hussein of Jordan.   For more than a week now, Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has been expected in Amman at the invitation of King Hussein, who wants to try again to obtain Mr. Arafat's commitment to the crucial United Nations Resolution 242. The United States has said Mr. Arafat's endorsement of the measure is a step vital to the success of peace negotiations."

But alternating signals in the past few months of strength and weakness in the economy have helped to cause more than the usual amount of debate about the future.

To the country's dismay, Malta found itself caught in the sharp, longstanding dispute between Egypt and Libya. At the same time, Maltese officials appeared concerned with establishing a clear record of toughness against terrorism, partly to offset a belief among some Western nations that it had been lax in the past.

We would ''grow our way'' out of the deficit, they said.   As a Republican Senator from Texas in 1985, and with a projected Federal deficit of over $200 billion, Mr. Gramm has conceived a new quick fix: A plan of automatic spending cuts to balance the budget by 1991.

Darman, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, was shown a snippet from the Treasury's news ticker. The item quoted the Secretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldrige, doubting that the United States and other countries would intervene strongly in the currency markets to reduce the exchange rate of the dollar.   Mr. Darman got his boss, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, out of a meeting, and Mr. Baker telephoned Mr. Baldrige. According to people familiar with the incident, Mr. Baker told Mr. Baldrige that he had stepped out of bounds. Just two days before, at the Plaza Hotel in New York, Mr. Baker had announced an American-led five-nation agreement to knock down the dollar. But Mr. Baldrige, in theory one of the Administration's top economic policy makers, had not been included in the planning and misread the announcement.

After months of wrangling in the courts over Texaco's disputed $10.1 billion purchase of the Getty Oil Company in 1984 and weeks of exchanging emotional charges and countercharges in the news media, the two companies agreed on Friday to a limited legal truce and a news blackout intended to aid them in pursuing settlement talks.   The recent public posturing and legal maneuvering that often seemed more like a somewhat implausible episode of ''Dallas'' than real life now appear to be giving way to a quieter, if no less important, phase of the tangled case.   The talks are expected to be complex and arduous. While the form of any settlement being discussed now is not known, it is widely believed that Texaco will offer Pennzoil certain oil properties.

The transaction is expected to add more than $100 million in net income for BankAmerica in the fourth quarter, virtually assuring that the bank will report a profit for that period despite large loan losses, analysts said.   For Chrysler, the move is a further step for its Chrysler Financial Corporation subsidiary in its efforts to expand beyond financing automobile purchases. ''It puts Chrysler Corporation in the heart of the consumer finance business,'' Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said in a statement. Earlier this year, Chrysler Finance formed a leasing joint venture with the General Electric Credit Corporation and acquired E. F. Hutton Credit."

The White House is counting on a ripple effect from Mr. Reagan's decision to do more than lift his already high personal popularity and provide a shot of pride for the American public.

When its stock went public, it sold for a dizzying 50 times earnings. And sales of the company's powerful desktop computers, known as engineering work stations and used by engineers and other product designers, doubled and doubled again in 1983 and 1984, to reach $215.9 million.   These days, however, sales are flat and the stock has tumbled. On Wednesday, Apollo reported an $18.5 million loss in the third quarter, its first deficit since going public in March 1983. Apollo executives say they expect a turnaround soon, but Wall Street analysts are skeptical.   ''I don't think you will see much good news out of this company in the next six months,'' said David Wu, an analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc., a San Francisco-based securities firm. ''To recommend a stock like this, you'd have to look way out in the future.''"

Israel said the deployment seriously threatened regular Israeli reconnaissance missions over Lebanon.   Israeli military sources said the Syrian move - which Israel said began soon after Israeli jets shot down two Syrian MIG-23's in Syrian airspace on Nov. 19 - constituted a ''dangerous change in the status quo.''   Any Israeli plane flying over Lebanon will now be exposed to Soviet-made SAM-2, SAM-6 and SAM-8 surface-to-air missiles, the military sources said. Before three weeks ago, the Syrians had no SAM-2 batteries near the Lebanese border and far fewer SAM-6's and SAM-8's in that area, the sources said."

That is because the Japanese own 50 percent of the company, and they are here to help turn it around.   National Steel faces the same problems as its domestic competitors -imports, poor steel prices, lower demand - and each American steel company has sought its own solutions in a steel world turned upside down, National's solution has been to embrace its foreign competitors and try to learn from them.

An outcry followed that and Congress repealed this requirement last May. This month, however, the I.R.S. published voluminous regulations requiring that drivers show some kind of corroborating evidence of their business auto use."

On Thanksgiving Day, the 90 members of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs agreed to start formal preparations for opening multilateral trade negotiations next September.   Speaking at an international monetary and trade conference in Philadelphia on Monday, Arthur Dunkel, Director General of GATT, said: ''We can now look to the future with confidence that the tensions which have bedeviled international trade relations in recent years can be resolved through negotiation and not through threats of unilateral restrictions on trade which would endanger the survival of the trading system itself.''   But many threats to the system remain. One is the challenge to the old industrial leaders posed by the emergence of Japan as the world's largest exporter of manufactures, surpassing the United States and West Germany. In total exports, Japan is now tied for second place with West Germany, with each country's exports in 1984 equal to 8.9 percent of world trade."

The sources said Egypt had requested American technical assistance and advice at least 15 hours before the attempted rescue operation, during which 57 of the 59 deaths in the hijacking episode occurred, most of them apparently as a result of smoke inhalation from fire aboard the plane.   The United States promptly agreed to provide help, the sources said.

Protracted negotiations with the Maltese Government over conditions of entry, combined with confusion on the ground and serious gaps in communications among the parties concerned, kept the American technical team from arriving, according to these accounts."

Traders and analysts had mixed feelings about passing the milestone: Some said the rise just reflected short-term factors, such as takeover activity. Others said the increase pointed to strong economic growth; still others saw 1929 in every uptick. But the advance is impressive: It took the market more than 10 years to go from 1,000 to 1,100, but it took less than five months for it to leap from 1,300 to 1,400.   Paul A. Volcker helped the rally by repeating, in an unusually open manner, that the Fed was keeping a loose rein on monetary policy, apparently because it wants interest rates to fall even more. In the latest week, the basic money supply fell $2.2 billion. Bond prices rose moderately. Chrysler is regrouping into four divisions in a reorganization that will move the dynamic chairman, Lee A.

H. Macy & Company, the New York retailer, proposed to take the company private by purchasing each public share for $70 in cash. Though the deal had been quietly in the works for months, the executives disclosed their bid earlier than planned, after rumors of a buyout had suddenly lifted the stock $4 on heavy volume.   In mid-October, when a New York investment group offered $45 a share for the Beatrice Companies, the stock of the giant consumer products conglomerate had already risen $10 on a month-long spate of rumors.   Similar pre-announcement trading patterns have shown up in takeover or leveraged buyout offers for General Foods, Hoover, Richardson-Vicks, Pacific Lumber and Revlon. And in recent weeks, the stock and/or options of Avon Products, Freeport-McMoran, Gulf and Western and Westinghouse jumped prior to announcements that the companies would buy back some of their own shares."

The Reagan Administration, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and many policymakers and academic economists want European nations to step up economic growth by lowering taxes and increasing government spending.   Without greater vigor in Europe, it is feared, the slowdown from 1984's rapid growth rate in the United States will leave the whole Western economy growing dangerously slowly in coming years. That would make it harder for the United States to cut its trade deficit and resist protectionism. It would also hurt third-world exports and increase the risk of a new debt crisis, and it would push Europe's already high unemployment rate even higher."

A senior Cabinet official said that only if Jordan was to ''respond positively'' to Mr. Peres's offer would there be a real chance of the year-old coalition collapsing over how to proceed in negotiations.   Cabinet sources said two right-wing Likud ministers, David Levy and Ariel Sharon, led an attack on the Prime Minister's peace initiative, particularly his suggestion that the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council provide some kind of ''international accompaniment'' for the negotiations.

Before arriving at the conclusive vote on whether to send the bill to the Senate for action next year, the House will be allowed to vote on only one amendment, a Republican alternative tax plan that would be more favorable to business as a whole than either the plan submitted to Congress by President Reagan last May or the bill adopted by the Ways and Means Committee last week.

Oftentimes, the amount of permanent equity capital that is invested in a leveraged buyout amounts to only about 10 percent or less of the purchase price. The plan is that the loans will be paid back out of future earnings or, in some  cases, parts of the company are sold off after the transaction to repay debt.

Because the award - $10.53 billion - is so extraordinarily large, the consensus in the legal community is that either the trial judge in Houston, Solomon Casseb, or appellate judges will find some way to overturn or reduce the award. But some lawyers contend that it will not be as easy to overturn the award as people may think.   During the four-month trial, the jury had to decide two questions of fact: Should an informal agreement - in this case between Pennzoil and the Getty Oil Company - be considered a binding contract? Did a third party - in this case Texaco, which ultimately bought Getty for $10.1 billion -improperly interfere with the performance of that agreement? On both issues, the jury said yes."

The incident occurred as organizations and governments around the world called on the South African authorities to grant clemency to Mr. Moloise.   The witnesses said that about 300 youths began gathering at about 7 P.M. at the modest home of Mamike Moloise in the black township of Soweto, outside this city. Priscilla Jana, a lawyer for the condemned man, said that she had accompanied Mrs. Moloise to the house, where a message was waiting for Mrs. Moloise and her husband to go to the local police station."

Although United Nations, United States and private agency authorities have expressed satisfaction that international aid helped saved millions of lives in Africa, they said they feared that declining public interest and the intractability of Africa's deeper economic problems would make their new task much more difficult.   Maurice Strong, executive director of the United Nations Office of Emergency Operations in Africa, said: ''Thirty-five million people were at imminent risk at the beginning of this year and 33 million of them are still alive. But we can only pause momentarily in our satisfaction. This is just the first battle in what will be a long and painful war.''"

Traffic for October - and perhaps the fourth quarter - is not expected to show much more than an 8 percent rise, said Miss Tortora, despite good business travel.   With their flight frequencies already scheduled, carriers now face the prospect of some empty seats. And, says Miss Tortora, ''airlines have to fill seats when they are empty. If they haven't got enough volume, they'll lower the pricing.''"

Equity Programs, a real estate company based in Falls Church, Va., disclosed in August that it had missed payments on more than $1 billion of its mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Programs has since filed for bankruptcy protection, and most of the approximately 100 banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions that lent money to the company have been seeking to have their names kept secret.   Today, Judge Martin V. B. Bostetter granted their request. The judge did not issue a formal opinion explaining his order, but he apparently agreed with lawyers representing the financial institutions who argued that release of the names would lead to depositor panic and heavy withdrawals."

Critics of the Government immediately denounced the action, charging that it effectively ''banned'' opponents of white minority rule and was further evidence that the authorities were using emergency powers to suppress all opposition."

The Mexican Government made the decision in light of a weakening of its foreign economic relations and a trade deficit that has contributed to the country's indebtedness, the letter said."

A verbal ratification of the 1979 agreement is something that has been eagerly sought by the Western European allies, who hope for gestures from the American and Soviet leaders at the summit meeting to indicate that the arms-control process is being sustained.   But the disclosure of a letter by Defense Secretary Caspar W.

Without them, interest rates undoubtedly would have been higher, and the economic recovery following the 1981-82 recession may well have been less robust.   Now, however, economists say that the delicate balance these investors provide is threatened by the new American policy that aims to lower the value of the dollar against other currencies. And the concern is focusing a fresh look at where overseas buying is coming from, how important it is and to what extent it might dry up if a lower dollar lessens the attractiveness of Treasury securities.   In the first six months of 1985, net foreign purchases of Treasury securities totaled $14.3 billion, more than 17 percent of all investment in new Treasury issues. As recently as 1980, net purchases for the full year were only $10 billion, accounting for less than 10 percent of the total increase in Treasury debt."

A decade ago, Brazil barely had an arms industry. Now, analysts generally rank the country as the fifth-biggest arms exporter in the world, after the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain. Most of its 40 client nations are in the third world, where it often competes successfully with the big powers, but some of its more imaginative military equipment is also attracting the interest of members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

The execution of the black activist, Benjamin Moloise, 30 years old, set off rioting by hundreds of blacks in downtown Johannesburg. Two white policemen were stabbed, a black man was shot by security forces and at least eight white pedestrians were beaten on the city streets.   President P. W. Botha had received appeals from around the world to commute the execution, including appeals from the United States, the Commonwealth, the European Economic Community and the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution last year calling on the South African authorities not to execute Mr. Moloise. [In Washington, a State Department spokesman said, ''We have made plain our opinion that clemency in this case was justified.'' At the United Nations, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar deplored the hanging, and the Organization of African Unity denounced what it called the South African Government's ''act of barbarism.'']  Mr. Moloise's lawyers had asked that the case be reopened because of new evidence that they said would have led to commutation of the sentence. Mr. Moloise was sentenced to death in September 1983 for the murder of the security policeman 10 months earlier."

In discussing the difficulties of finding common ground only a few days before the Soviet-American summit meeting, the official said ''it boggles the mind'' that the Russians were still ''playing from two sheets of music,'' being conciliatory in public and less so in private.

It is the dream of what used to be half-derided as the ''chunnel'' and is now formally described in British and French Government specifications as the ''fixed link'': the channel tunnel or tunnels, or combination of tunnels and viaducts, that will finally join Britain to the Continent, symbolically ending its insular status.   Early in the new year, the two Governments are expected to announce a formal agreement to proceed with one of four privately financed projects for what the rival promoters have been hailing as Europe's greatest civil engineering project. Dover, the largest of the 16 British Channel ports between Plymouth in the southwest and Hull in the northeast, will die a little when that happens.   By the time - maybe five years from now - that the ''fixed link'' becomes a reality, taking most of the traffic that now moves by ferry or Hovercraft or Channel freighter, Dover and the other channel ports in England's southeast will have lost their reason for being. At least that is the despairing forecast of a loose coalition of ferry companies, local merchants, environmentalists and village parish councils throughout Kent's green countryside who consider themselves to be menaced by the project."

The raid was the most damaging guerrilla action against Government forces this year and one of the few large attacks in the last year and a half. It suggested that the guerrillas still have the ability to carry out well-planned hit-and-run actions at a time when their military fortunes have otherwise seemed to be slipping.   Despite warnings of possible rebel attack, security at the base appears to have been lax. Guerrilla squads penetrated the perimeter and dropped grenades into barracks of sleeping troops, according to three different accounts by soldiers who said they had fought off attackers. From about 100 yards away, other rebels fired 90-millimeter recoilless rifle rounds, RPG-7 rockets and mortars point-blank into the tin-sheeted barracks. #5 U.S. Advisers at Base Five American military advisers were at the base during the attack, according to James Williams, a spokesman for the United States Embassy. None of the Americans were hurt, he said, adding that he ''believed'' the advisers had not taken part in the fighting, but that he could not confirm that they had not."

Whether we speak of Israel, or our friends in Central America, or in Africa, or Southwest or Southeast Asia, we or our friends must pursue negotiation and compromise in good faith and with dedication. Such an attitude strengthens moderates on the other side, helps defuse radicalism and offers hope for a solution."

Timothy Raison, the Overseas Aid Minister, made the announcement, charging that the agency, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, is inefficient and badly managed and has been ''harmfully politicized.'' It ''has been used to attack those very values which it was designed to uphold, '' he said.      Gave Notice a Year Ago   Last December, the British served notice, as required by law, of their intention to withdraw from Unesco, complaining about what they viewed as an anti-Western stance. They also complained that Unesco spends 70 percent of its budget at its Paris headquarters, rather than in the field. But until today, the British had left open the possibility they would change their minds if Unesco made major changes."

The two-door sedan is the first used car the couple ever purchased. They needed a larger car because their son is growing up, and ''the price was right,'' said Mr. Broudeaux.   Like the Broudeaux, more and more people are finding the prices of today's used cars too good to pass up. The boom in new car sales in the past few months has resulted in a pile-up of used cars on dealers' lots. That has pushed down prices by 20 percent or more, and generated a medley of new and unusual incentives, as sellers compete to clear their overflowing lots. As a result, shopping around is more profitable than ever. The buyer's market creates opportunities to play one dealer against the other: Confident bargainers hold out for lower prices, larger cash rebates or longer warranties."

Thus, when the board of the Beatrice Companies voted last month to award $24 million in golden parachutes to six corporate executives, many shareholders rushed into court to try to shoot those parachutes down. They were encouraged by recent actions in other state courts.   In 18 lawsuits, Beatrice shareholders assert, among other things, that it was a violation of fiduciary duty and a waste of corporate assets to lavish such parachutes upon Beatrice's top managers. They point out, for example, that William W. Granger Jr., chairman of Chicago-based Beatrice for just four months, is to receive a $7 million parachute once Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the investment firm, completes its acquisition of the food and consumer-goods company."

But the promise faded last week when the 22-nation International Tin Council  announced it could no longer afford to maintain its huge price support program, and the price of the metal plummeted nearly 20 percent.

It was a routine patrol within the perimeter of this vast base, with no enemy and no war. But the symbolism did not escape the soldiers themselves.   ''Charlie's out there somewhere,'' one of them joked, using the terminology of the Vietnam War.      A Growing Issue   With increasing anxiety in Washington about the stability of the Philippine Government, and plans under way to invest $1.3 billion to upgrade America's two big bases here, the long-term security of the installations has become a growing issue."

CHARGES SAVIN IN ACCOUNTING VIOLATION,"  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the Savin Corporation with violating generally accepted principles in its accounting of research and development spending. The S.E.C. said the violations let the company understate its losses by $49 million between 1981 and 1984.   Accounting treatment of research and development costs has been the subject of continued debate among high-technology companies, which have complained that there are not enough tax breaks to stimulate higher levels of research. So the S.E.C. action against Savin, an office products company, is especially significant to them."

But there is something else on the horizon, almost too small to notice at first glance. It is a little knot of mourners gathered at the water's edge, waiting for this alien lake to give them back the bodies of its first victims, their sons and fathers.   The people are Ibans, the longhouse-dwellers of Sarawak, a Malaysian state on the north coast of the island of Borneo. The remainder of Malaysia is on the Malay Peninsula."

Dozens of previous agreements between Lebanese Christian and Moslem leaders have collapsed in the last decade. But Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has said it is determined to pacify its unruly neighbor.   Even sources among the Christians - traditionally the group most hostile to Syrian intervention - said conditions now appear favorable for an end to Lebanon's fighting. But the Christian sources said differences remain over the pace of political changes demanded by Moslems."
