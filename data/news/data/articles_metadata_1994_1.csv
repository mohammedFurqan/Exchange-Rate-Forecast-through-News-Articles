These and dozens of other American name brands are sure to be welcomed, both because Vietnam is aching to end its psychological isolation and because American businesses are positioned to sell what the country wants most.   But there is a real question of whether Vietnam can grow fast enough to justify an aggressive marketing effort. While David Dollar, an economist at the World Bank, is ""cautiously optimistic"" that Vietnam will soon break out of the pack of the world's poorest countries, the obstacles are formidable."

The column was thrust into the spotlight in 1988, after its author noticed suspect pre-publication gains in some stocks he wrote about. A leak later was found at R. R. Donnelley & Sons, which prints Business Week."

So whenever a trade crisis erupted -- first over textiles, then autos, computer chips, beef and citrus, cellular phones, baseball bats and construction -- there was always a last-minute sucking-in of breath from Tokyo and a deal. Some worked, some failed, some markets opened and many had an odd way of remaining sealed, but open confrontation was avoided."

Unemployment was not part of our emotional baggage, not part of the range of things that we thought we would ever have to face.""   How times have changed.

At the White House, minimalist economists also have turned monotony into an art -- even though George Bush's failure to whip up the economy put Bill Clinton in the White House.

Wellpoint, a managed health care company with 2.3 million members, acquired Unicare for $29 a share in cash, or about $154 million. Unicare had 1992 revenue of $146 million. In the last year, Wellpoint has introduced two plans that use managed care techniques to help control workers' compensation costs. California's insurance department is encouraging the packaging of health insurance and workers' compensation as a cost-saver for businesses."

The fund owns companies with market capitalizations up to $1 billion and looks primarily for rapid earnings growth when picking stocks. The fund's risk is partly mitigated by its diverse portfolio. Even so, share prices of small, rapidly growing companies can be very volatile.   The Scudder Emerging Markets Income Fund invests in debt securities of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, and can buy debt in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Although emerging markets have greater growth potential than those of more developed nations, they carry more risk as well. Most of the issues in emerging markets are junk bonds and trade at big discounts to their face value, adding price volatility and default risk to the risk of political instability. So make sure you have a long time horizon."

The confessed gunman, Mario Aburto Martinez, refused to characterize the groups or to say whether he was working with anyone when he assassinated Luis Donaldo Colosio at a campaign rally on Wednesday, said the lawyer, Jose Luis Perez Canchola.  ""His clear intention was to hurt the candidate in order to get media attention and express his pacifist ideas and to share some information about armed groups that work in several states around the country,"" Mr. Perez said, summarizing Mr. Aburto's statements under interrogation on the night of the killing. ""It's a contradiction, but that's what he said."""

In an unusually blunt statement, President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said the United Nations, which has the authority to call NATO troops into action in the former Yugoslavia, ""must without delay give itself the means"" to open Tuzla airport and relieve United Nations troops in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica."

Imagine that the company put out news releases that turned out to be less than accurate. And imagine that you bought at around $11.75 a share when the good news was announced, only to watch the stock sink to $4 when it become clear that the ""news"" was fiction.

The hard part will be expanding exports to shrink a nearly $60 billion trade deficit. Unfortunately, the Administration is neglecting a crucial step in that quest -- revamping the nation's lead agency for export promotion.  The Administration is not unaware of the difficulties of increasing exports. Its National Export Strategy, unveiled last fall by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, proposes the removal of export restrictions on computers and other worthwhile initiatives. But the strategy has many shortcomings. A principal one is its failure to help exporters penetrate specific markets."

The proposals, like keying cleanup standards to land use and involving community groups, are ambitious. But, as Congress considers the issue this year, it should select a much different strategy: turn most of Superfund over to the states.  Few doubt that something must be done about Superfund. Since the law went into effect in 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency has completed cleanup of only about 200 of 1,300 Federal waste sites. Litigation is rampant. The typical cleanup takes 10 years and costs about $30 million."

A compelling example is its successful effort to guard our interests in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

This neglect is costly because international investment has grown greatly. In 1992, it generated $5 trillion worldwide -- surpassing even the $4 trillion of international trade."

The Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, has suddenly doubled his own inflation forecasts, now projecting a rate of 15 to 18 percent a month by the end of the year. The state energy sector warned of ""a complete paralysis of economic activity"" unless somebody started paying bills owed to it. The Economics Minister, Aleksandr N. Shokhin, talked of price controls and unpaid Government obligations of 7 trillion rubles ($4.4 billion), which Mr. Chernomyrdin vows to pay."

There is nothing inherently wrong with market makers' earning the spread for risk positions they take in bringing immediacy and liquidity to the market. Exchange specialists and ""upstairs"" traders also earn the spread when they participate in investor transactions and, according to the April 1993 edition of the NYSE Fact Book, they do so in 45.3 percent of New York Stock Exchange share volume. This number also means that less than 55 percent of the volume on the Big Board involves customer orders meeting customer orders."

With the Chinese economy booming and French companies effectively excluded from bidding for contracts there since the decision in November 1992 to sell 60 Mirage jets to Taiwan, the announcement amounted to a potentially important development for France's recession-hit economy."

The crossover -- when technological potential becomes market phenomenon -- is what experts call an ""inflection point"" or (dare we use the term?) a ""paradigm shift."" The much-heralded information superhighway could be one. The project to watch begins in April in Orlando, led by Time Warner Entertainment. It will bring information technology and state-of-the-art entertainment -- such things as video-on-demand -- into 4,000 homes. Odds are that much of the reporting and commentary about it will be skeptical in tone, poking a hole in the digital balloon.

Barry Diller, right, who spent most of the year trying to acquire Paramount, considers the notion mostly whimsy. For some time to come viewers will watch television pretty much as always -- specific programs on specific channels, available at specific times. What will change will be relationships between program producers and distributors. Paramount and Warner Brothers each want to create new networks because they expect CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox to produce more of their own programs and buy less from the studios. One result: more news-magazine programs as a hedge against a shortage of entertainment programming. By Bill Carter. C11  That's Patented?     Computer software publishers were stunned when Compton's New Media received a patent for an information search technique used in multi-media databases. Published on compact disks, the databases provide information by combining text, color pictures, sound, animation and video on computer screens.

Resentment was most acute among prosperous northern Italians, who felt that their pockets were being picked by the Government in Rome for pork-barrel projects in the depressed south.   In 1982, Mr. Bossi founded a newspaper in Varese, his hometown north of Milan, called Lombardia Autonomista, which became the mouthpiece of his movement.  Known initially as the Lombard League, it promised northern Italians autonomy from the south.  Changing its name in 1991 to the Northern League, it marched from victory to victory in local elections. Mr. Bossi entered Parliament in Rome in 1992."

Price controls and monopoly purchasing cooperatives will indeed stifle innovation and drain needed private-sector investment capital away from the health care industry.

Instead, the Cooper and Chafee plans create market incentives based on competition by insuring active, appropriately motivated and pluralistic purchasers and suppliers. While such a system will change the incentives for innovation from cost-increasing technologies to cost-reducing technologies, innovations that improve quality while lowering cost -- the kind our system truly needs -- will be rewarded handsomely.

The percentage of households with telephones has increased, from 91.4 percent in 1983 to 94.2 percent in 1993, according to the Federal Communications Commission. For the poorest fifth of the population, this rose from 80.1 percent to 83.7 percent. Average telephone rates did not double or triple, but grew at only half the rate of inflation. Industry research and development increased, too, as did productivity, although at the expense of some employment. The market for telecommunications equipment became competitive, with prices that are now among the lowest worldwide. Nor were the very poor damaged by divestiture; a cheap ""lifeline"" service was introduced."

What they will see on April 9 is a stunning physical and technological achievement. The 777, the largest twin-engine plane ever built, sports the biggest, most powerful aircraft engines ever made -- the housing around each is as wide as the fuselage of a 737 or 757. Designed entirely on computer screens and assembled without mockups, it is the first ""paperless"" jetliner. And because it has just two engines, and needs only two pilots, it should cost 25 percent less to operate than older models of the four-engine 747, which it is meant to eventually replace.

It is a tax write-off that could also lift some bank stocks and make the country's strong banks stronger and its weak banks weaker.   The heart of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan was a jolt of one-time income-tax reductions combined with big increases in public works spending. But the Finance Ministry, which had hammered out the details, inserted the bad debt program at the end. It will have a negligible short-term impact on the recession, but in the long-term it could provide sizable benefits."

And GTE, the largest local phone company, said it would cut 17,000 jobs -- more than 14 percent of its worldwide total. But in the midst of this all-too-familiar chorus, there appeared a welcome voice -- one big company would be adding, not subtracting.

Quality, design and efficiency have improved tremendously. Last year it was one of the few European auto makers to weather a sales slump profitably."

Nearly a month after the value of the African franc was suddenly and sharply cut in half when France bowed to Western pressure to end what amounted to a subsidy, people are trying to adapt to painful price increases for nearly everything they eat and drink.  Prices for pharmaceutical products, nearly all of which are imported, have soared. The cost of drugs for malaria, the continent's biggest killer, have nearly doubled in some places, putting them out of reach of many Africans."

But neither his proposal nor any of the other leading proposals will yield the desired results. They all fail to recognize the central importance of innovation in reducing health care costs.   The Administration's proposal does try to control costs; it just does it the wrong way. It depends upon simplified paperwork, the greater bargaining power of new purchasing alliances and caps on prices. But costs cannot be reduced enough with these measures, which are essentially ways to deliver today's health care more efficiently. The savings from these efforts are possible and necessary, but the desire to widen access to health care, the growing health needs of an aging population and Americans' demands for the best treatments available will soon overwhelm the gains."

These investments may come back to haunt them if, as many pundits predict, the dollar strengthens this year."

Japan is still mired in economic woes, though there is some talk of a rebound. China, whose growth in the last year has been in the mid-teens, could experience a slowdown -- to merely spectacular 10 percent growth. Then there is Russia, which must balance international calls for austerity with domestic politics and slow- or fast-paced privatization. From around the world, correspondents of The New York Times assess local economies.   With little question, Poland appears to be Eastern Europe's star economy. The gross domestic product grew an estimated 4 percent in 1993, making it the fastest-growing economy in all of Europe and the only one of the former Communist countries to achieve economic growth. Substantial growth in retail sales, evident in the burgeoning Western-style shops in big cities, and an upswing in industrial production accounted for much of the acceleration."

You see, the curve may have profoundly moved an artsy car designer like Mr. Santoro -- light would bounce off it prettily, and it would make the sedan feel roomier -- but to a pragmatic engineer, faced with the grittier task of freezing the design in steel and then stamping out hundreds of thousands of durable duplicates, it was a migraine. No one could remember a sedan's sides curving so sharply (both front to back, like a horseshoe, and top to bottom, like parentheses). No hinge existed that would make the doors swing properly, the engineers assigned to the project said when they saw Mr. Santoro's clay model."

Last week brought strong data on construction and manufacturing, and a report that consumers did what they can't help doing in December: buy lots of stuff. To top it off, the unemployment rate for the month clicked downward again, to 6.4 percent, a three-year low. The rise in payrolls was a modest 183,000, serving to dampen fear of revived inflation. All this helped the insatiable stock market keep nudging to new records, as the Dow industrials passed 3,800 and kept on going. With a strong 1993 wrapped up, though, some people may stop looking at an economic glass that's half full, and rising, and focus instead on how empty it still is. More than half the new jobs were temporary, and 8.23 million Americans still want any job but don't have one. That's a lot of Fridays without paychecks, a lot of children without new shoes."

The strengthening of the dollar against the yen since the dollar's historic low point in August, amounting to a rise of more than 12 percent, could lead to improved profits for Japan's automobile and electronics giants and help pave the way for a slow but eventual recovery of the stagnant Japanese economy, company officials and economists suggest. Toyota Now Sees Profit    Last summer, for instance, when currency rates had fallen to just above 100 yen to the dollar, the Toyota Motor Company said it might report its first operating loss ever. But with the dollar having risen, Tatsuro Toyoda, the company's president, recently reaffirmed that the company now expects a small operating profit in the current fiscal year ending June 30."

For months now, the economic numbers have been consistently strong -- whether on car sales, unemployment or housing starts (which just took another jump). Reflecting this vigor, stock prices are setting records almost daily. But not until last week did the public finally sign on. A poll showed that for the first time since mid-1990, when recession began chipping away at spirits -- and at George Bush's job security -- half of Americans expressed confidence in the economy. So it's no surprise that President Clinton, who can thank the recession for his job, now has the approval of 54 percent of the public. One heartening figure: A year ago, 40 percent of Americans feared for a family member's job; that's down to 21 percent."

So it fit their vision nicely last week when Martin Marietta agreed to buy Grumman for $1.9 billion. As its Pentagon contracts dried up, Grumman tried to make it in the real world, but could never quite manage. It can't be that much of a loser, though, because suddenly Northrop got into the act, raising the ante by offering $2.04 billion for it. That's $60 a share, but Grumman stock leapt to $64.75 on Friday -- yes, a bidding war's brewing. What's up? Clearly, even with shrinking budgets, there's still money in high-tech weaponry, and Grumman can be a big plus. But one thing doesn't change: whoever wins, a lot more jobs will disappear at Grumman, Long Island's largest corporate employer."

Social scientists have yet to nail down the answer. But economists now have good reason to believe that blondes make more money -- or at least the trim, attractive ones do.

One is tempted to write off the results as proof that idle econometricians are the Devil's helpers. But the findings from Daniel Hamermesh of the University of Texas and Jeff Biddle of Michigan State are complemented by other research showing that obese women are also at a considerable earnings disadvantage. And they could figure prominently in the very serious business of deciding who is protected by the three-year-old Americans With Disabilities Act."

Withdrawals    What is the minimum amount that must be withdrawn annually from an individual retirement account when I reach age 70 1/2?   ROSLYN SCHLANSKY, Manhattan    Although you can start withdrawing funds from an I.R.A. at age 59 1/2, withdrawals must begin by April 1 of the year after the one in which you reach 70 1/2. The minimum distribution is based on the account's balance on Dec. 31 of the previous year.   Distributions in any single year may not exceed $150,000, with a penalty of 15 percent on larger amounts. And if you fail to withdraw enough to satisfy the minimum requirement, you will have to pay a penalty tax of 50 percent of the amount that should have been withdrawn.    ""The minimum distribution for each year must be calculated in one of three ways,"" said Martin Leventhal, head of a New York accounting firm bearing his name. ""You can use the life expectancy of the owner, the life expectancy of the owner and a beneficiary or a specific period less than either of the first two categories."" Information on calculating the minimum distribution is available by calling (800) 829-3676 and asking for I.R.S. Publication 590, Individual Retirement Arrangements.   Ending Partnership Deals    Am I condemned to carry a dormant partnership investment for the indefinite future or is there some way of claiming a long-term capital loss?   J.J. BODDEWYN, Manhattan    The interest in a limited partnership can be abandoned, but there are potential pitfalls. For example, you may have to satisfy a potential tax liability on deferred income that you never received, called a recapture tax.   In addition, ""when you abandon the investment, the limited partner is responsible for his or her share of the liabilities,"" said David Scott O'Bryon, president of the American Association of Limited Partners. ""There may also be offsetting losses and gains. Most investors try to write off their investment as worthless, which is hard to prove.""   Willing Real Property    In my will, I am leaving my condominium unit to a person of limited financial means. Until the will is probated and he receives a cash bequest, how can he be protected against mortgage foreclosure?   MORTON MOSKOWITZ, Brooklyn    Personal property passes to the heirs at the time of distribution, which is often not made until the legal and financial affairs of the estate are settled. Title to real property, like a condominium, usually passes at the date of death.   You ""could provide in the will that the estate is responsible for all of the carrying charges -- common charges, real estate taxes, mortgage interest and amortization -- for a fixed period of time or until administration is complete,"" said Laurence Keiser, a partner in Greenfield Eisenberg Stein & Senior, a New York law firm. ""Another alternative would be to require the executor to make preliminary distributions as advances against the cash bequest.""   As a practical matter, creditors are normally more understanding when an estate is involved and will try to avoid foreclosure under such circumstances.  "

""There's a big fight going on in Japan now,"" he said the other day, describing a classic struggle between the mandarins who have run Japan's industrial and trade policies for four decades and the reformers, led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who are fighting to open an economy now choking on overregulation."

Because of their limited scope, these funds are usually more volatile than diversified stock funds. Investors sometimes have trouble sitting tight when share prices fluctuate: assets of health care funds, for example, have slid to $4 billion, from $6 billion in 1991, when such stocks were flying high.   Among the losers early this year were utility funds, which have suffered from an uptick in interest rates. Most of the laggards, however, were victims of profit taking in the emerging markets of Southeast Asia, which enjoyed terrific run-ups last year but have fallen back. Pacific stock funds were hit hardest, not surprising given their 55 percent average return last year. Foreign and world stock fund categories were also penalized for Southeast Asian holdings."

In fact, the F.T.C. has recently issued a significant number of advertising cases and other consumer protection actions despite ever-tightening resources and a staff of fewer than 1,000 people.   Further, several of the examples Mr. Silverglade cited just don't support his case. Misleading airline advertising, for example, is specifically excluded from the F.T.C.'s jurisdiction.

But when it comes to advanced technology -- the genie in the lamp poised to deliver everything digital to a nation of Aladdins -- Viacom may have an edge, whether the 70-year-old Mr. Redstone, born in the age of radio and silent films, wins Paramount or not. For one thing, Viacom will be able to tap the technological skills of A.T.& T., its partner in a cable television project to begin later this year."

The revisions affect about $4 billion of debt. Moody's attributed the lowered ratings to expectations that Westinghouse would take longer than previously believed to rebuild its depleted capital structure. Moody's lowered ratings on Westinghouse senior notes and debentures to Ba1 from Baa3 and medium-term notes to Ba1 from Baa3. Other ratings that were cut were industrial revenue bonds, to Ba1 from Baa3; preferred stock, to Ba3 from Ba1, and commercial paper, to nonprime from Prime-3. Shares of Westinghouse fell 25 cents yesterday, to $13.625, on the New York Stock Exchange."

After five years at the Boston-based high-tech consultancy the Yankee Group, Mr. Colony started Forrester in 1983, fascinated with the Darwinian nature of high technology.

Negotiators in the talks to merge the Bell Atlantic Corporation with Tele-Communications Inc. attributed the failure of the deal to new Government rules that will roll back rates 7 percent, or $1.45 for the average bill of $20.45 a month. The rollback by the Federal Communications Commission would severely hurt the projected cash flow of Tele-Communications and thus its potential value as a merger partner with Bell Atlantic, Tele-Communications executives said."

The end of the cold war has left military contractors scrambling to survive on a shrinking Pentagon budget for jets, ships and tanks. The Pentagon's purchases of new weapons and equipment have declined 64 percent since 1985, military industry analysts say."

In response to the Florida allegations, Metropolitan Life began its own investigation, which led to the dismissal at the end of last year of seven employees, the highest ranking being a senior vice president. Ted Athanassiades, Metropolitan's president and the company's No. 2 executive, was not among the executives disciplined for involvement in improperly selling insurance policies across the country through the Tampa office."

These gains gave us higher income, a shorter workweek, bigger pensions and earlier retirement. But with lagging productivity, benefits are shrinking and real income is falling, bringing on a frightening batch of social and political problems.  According to some observers, America's switch from a manufacturing economy to a service economy makes it unlikely the country will ever resume the productivity gains of the past. As William Baumol, the economist, has pointed out, a barber can cut only so many heads of hair each day, and a fast-food clerk can serve only so many lunches between 12 P.M. and 2 P.M."

In an agreement with Japan that was signed here Thursday with little fanfare, the United States said it would adopt a system in which patents, once granted, would be valid until 20 years after the date on which they were filed. Currently, American patents are valid for 17 years from the date they are granted. The Administrative Factor    Occasionally, patents take a decade or two to be granted because they are held up in appeals and amendments in the Patent Office. When this happens under the existing system, an inventor can obtain a 17-year monopoly on an invention made long ago and demand payments from companies that have long been using the technology on the assumption that it was not protected by patents."

So, having helped two weeks ago to bring about at least a temporary end to the artillery bombardment that had threatened to pound Sarajevo into submission, the Clinton Administration is disinclined to see the latest developments as a setback. Indeed, both military and civilian officials suggested that by responding firmly, NATO may have made further trouble in the area much less likely."
