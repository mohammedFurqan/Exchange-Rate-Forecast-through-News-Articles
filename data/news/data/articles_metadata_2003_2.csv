Not strictly an adventure or strategy game, Second Life is a vast playground of pixels where the players use the game's tools to build houses, cities and businesses for other players to visit. Players can buy and sell virtual commodities like art or weapons, dance together in exotic nightclubs or just hang out and chat. Unlike simulation games that rely on specific rules, Second Life takes a rather free-form approach.

Net income rose to $94.6 million, or 73 cents a share, from $71.5 million, or 53 cents a share. Sales increased 5.7 percent to $1.11 billion from $1.05 billion, Lexmark said. Supplies like ink cartridges rose 18 percent, while sales of hardware like printers fell 7.7 percent. Hardware sales fell because of a transition to a new product line, the loss of Compaq Computer as a reseller and not being able to satisfy demand for all-in-one printers, the chief financial officer, Gary Morin, said. ''It was a relief to see them meet the high end of their guidance,'' said Tim Jossart, co-manager of the Touchstone Value Plus Fund, which manages $40 million in assets and holds 26,430 Lexmark shares. In January, the company had given a first-quarter forecast of 62 cents to 72 cents a share and analysts had expected 72 cents, according to a survey of nine analysts by Thomson First Call. Shares of Lexmark rose 31 cents, to $69.50 yesterday. They have gained 16 percent this year.  "

The directory sale added $1.31 billion to earnings. Total sales fell 4.5 percent, to $6.34 billion from $6.64 billion. Sprint is relying on expense reductions to generate profit amid declining sales at its main phone business and slowing wireless revenue. The new chief executive, Gary Forsee, has less room to slash costs than his predecessor, William Esrey, who eliminated about 15,000 jobs in the last two years, analysts said. The company lowered its forecast for 2003 per-share profits at the local and long-distance phone unit by 10 cents a share, to $1.30 to $1.35. It also expects a sales decline of as much as 7 percent. That compares with a previous sales estimate of a low single-digit-rate decline. Sprint PCS's 2003 loss-forecast range was widened by 5 cents a share to 45 cents to 50 cents a share. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Sprint's main phone unit rose 22 cents, to $11.27 a share. The company released results after the close of regular trading.
