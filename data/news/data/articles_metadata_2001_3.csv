Lion Nathan has identified other opportunities in the wine business, Mr. Cairns said.   Becky Gaylord (NYT) EUROPE FINLAND: SETBACK FOR SAMPO Sampo, Finland's largest insurer, suffered a setback in its $2.3 billion bid for its Norwegian rival Storebrand, when Norwegian regulators refused to lift a rule that requires financial companies to acquire more than 90 percent of a target's outstanding stock. Only 86.3 percent of Storebrand investors have turned over their shares to Sampo, not enough to secure a deal under the requirements. The Norwegian government was widely expected to enforce the rule, in part because it did not want the country's largest insurer to fall into foreign ownership. Den Norske Bank, Norway's largest bank, has hindered the deal by refusing to sell its almost 10 percent stake in Storebrand to Sampo.   Suzanne Kapner (NYT) FRANCE: TEST FLIGHT FOR CONCORDE Air France took a Concorde jet for a test flight for the first time since one crashed into a hotel shortly after takeoff on July 25, 2000, killing 113 people.

Pubmaster's chief executive, John Sands, has said he wants to add 3,000 pubs to the 2,000 the company already owns. Pubmaster's bid of 513 pence a share valued the company, one of Britain's largest regional brewers and owner of 1,770 pubs, at £485 million ($690 million), a price that Wolverhampton had called too low.

The purchase was agreed on the eve of a hostile takeover of Montedison by the Fiat group.

Jim Whitney, a spokesman for AOL Time Warner, declined to comment, but Wall Street analysts and some employees said they expected layoffs to begin this week. The cuts would be the second major round of layoffs this year at the company, the world's largest Internet and media company. The company cut about 2,400 jobs in January. John Corcoran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, who met with J. Michael Kelly, AOL Time Warner's chief financial officer, on Friday, said that the company was looking to cut costs in its cable and music divisions. Mr. Corcoran said he had no specific knowledge of layoffs and maintained a strong buy on the stock. Last month, Gerald M. Levin, chief executive of AOL Time Warner, said that advertising revenue was stabilizing and that he did not expect to make specific layoffs.   Andrew Zipern (NYT) INTERNET LOUDCLOUD OFFERS SMALLER PACKAGES Loud- cloud Inc., which manages Web sites for corporations, said it would sell services individually rather than only as a large package. Individually sold services will include Web security and database management, said Jeff Kupietzky, general manager of the solutions group at Loudcloud. The change is meant to attract more customers, because businesses are cutting spending amid a weak economy. Loudcloud, founded by Marc Andreessen, above, who helped develop Netscape's Internet browser, cut its fiscal 2002 sales estimate in June to $53 million from $57 million. Stock in Loudcloud, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has dropped 74 percent since March.   (Bloomberg News) INTERNET USE GROWING SLOWLY Fifty-eight percent of Americans had Internet access in their homes in July 2001, compared with 52 percent in July 2000, according to new data from the Internet audience measurement service Nielsen/NetRatings.

In his first seven months on the job, he has made it abundantly clear that he does not like fighting fires, which is the way he characterizes running to the rescue of emerging market countries that have gotten into financial trouble, as Argentina has right now.    He has said repeatedly that he wants to reduce the time and money that international financial institutions, led by the International Monetary Fund, spend on firefighting. ''Certainly, there will always be unexpected events that we and the institutions will have to deal with, but firefighting should be the exceptional cases for these institutions, not the norm,'' he said in April. All these comments were a rebuke of the Clinton administration's hands-on firefighting, from the rescue package for Mexico in 1995 to aid for Brazil in 1998.  "

The agency, Standard & Poor's, raised the rating yesterday in advance of the sale of $8.7 million in bonds next week by the county, which is northwest of New York City in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains.
