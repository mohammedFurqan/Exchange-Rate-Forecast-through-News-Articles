Jobs of Apple a seat on Disney's board. Whatever the board decides, the aggressive pursuit of a deal by Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive, speaks volumes about his own ambitions and how he perceives his company's future. [Page C1.]    The calculus of Disney in seeking to acquire Pixar is simple: big media conglomerate plus vaunted computer animation studio plus closer ties with Steven P. Jobs, the maverick Pixar founder, equals potential powerhouse. But because Mr. Jobs's other job is chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, a deal also raises the possibility of a warmer relationship between Disney and Apple if Mr. Jobs plays an active role at the company. [C1.]    Albertsons Is Said to Be Close to a Deal  Albertsons Inc., the giant supermarket chain, was close to a reaching an agreement to be acquired by a group of companies and investment firms for about $9.7 billion in cash and stock, people involved in the talks said. [C1.]    When Feedback Turns Angry, Blogs Can Go Haywire  As shown by an onslaught of negative comments on the Web site of The Washington Post from people angry at its ombudsman, when people can say anything on blogs, they frequently do. David Carr. [C1.]    New Health Site Aims to Challenge WebMD  A new Web site owned by Healthline Networks acts as a medical search engine, finding articles on ailments and remedies from some 66,000 Web sites it has identified as providing medical content. In doing so, Healthline says it offers consumers a broader choice of information than WebMD, which is by far the most popular single medical resource online, and a more refined choice than general search engines like Google. Healthline's chairman and chief executive, West Shell III, above, said several factors argued in favor of the company's success this time around, after a similar venture was unsuccessful. Consumers remain deeply interested in online health information, he said, and pharmaceutical and other medical advertisers are starting to open their wallets more generously to the Web. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C4.]    The Risks and Rewards of Web Recommendations  Web technology capable of compiling vast amounts of customer data makes it possible for online stores to recommend items tailored to a specific shopper's interests. Companies are finding that getting those personalized recommendations right -- or even close -- can mean significantly higher sales. But spewing out recommendations is not entirely without risk. [C1.]    Films to Appear at Same Time in Theaters and on Cable  Hollywood inched further toward making movies simultaneously available in theaters, on DVD and on television screens as IFC Entertainment unveiled a plan to release 24 films in theaters and on cable at the same time this year. [C3.]    Web Offered Early Clues on 'A Million Little Pieces'  Right after James Frey's ''A Million Little Pieces,'' billed as a memoir, was released in April 2003, readers with addiction histories of their own indicated on the Internet that something was wrong -- long before an exposé on the Smoking Gun Web site this month. Tom Zeller Jr.: Link by Link. [C3.]    Conference Extols Word-of-Mouth Marketing  A conference in Orlando, Fla., called ''Word-of-Mouth Basic Training'' sought to teach participants how to tap into the power of word of mouth, an ancient form of communication that many marketers have updated by using blogs, podcasting and online message boards. Advertising. [C7.]    Traditional Radio Pursues Digital Strategy  Traditional broadcast radio, the last bastion of analog entertainment technology, sees a bright future for itself. Its strategy for success is to become more like one of its main competitors -- subscription satellite radio -- by offering digital side channels. [C4.]    From Disney, a Magazine for New Parents  Disney, through its Disney Worldwide Publishing division, will join the crowded but profitable parenting magazine category next month. The new magazine, Wondertime, is aimed at anxious parents of the very, very young. [C5.]"

It was the 15th such increase in consecutive meetings of the group. [Page C1.]    Two Senators Drop Plans for Tariffs Against China  Two of China's most relentless critics in Congress announced a temporary cease-fire in their long-running attack on China's foreign-exchange practices. In an about-face, Senators Charles E. Schumer and Lindsey Graham dropped plans for a bill that would threaten steep tariffs on Chinese imports. [C1.]    G.M.'s Chief in a Spot, but He's Been There Before  Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, has been here before. In 1992, at the age of 39, he was the chief financial officer and was among a fresh slate of executives call on to replace the existing management and rescue the company from the worst financial crisis in its history. Now the question is: Can he do it again? [C1.]    Two weeks after it increased its 2005 loss by $2 billion, G.M. said that it would restate several years' worth of results for its GMAC financing arm. G.M. also said it did not know if it would be able to sell a controlling interest in GMAC because of the complexity of arranging a deal. [C5.]    General Motors laid off several hundred white-collar workers on Tuesday, its latest move in a restructuring plan that is cutting deeply into all ranks of the company. [C5.]    A Dubai Company Decides to Turn the Other Cheek  The president of the Emirates Group, Dubai's airline, readily acknowledges that he was dismayed by what happened in Washington to DP World, the giant port operator that is one of Emirates' sister companies. As one of Boeing's largest customers and a major buyer of General Electric jet engines, the Emirates Group is the Dubai company best positioned to retaliate against the United States by taking its business elsewhere. But rather than divert aircraft orders to Airbus, Boeing's rival, executives at the company say they have decided to turn the other cheek. [C1.]    Prosecution Rests Case Against Former Enron Executives  After more than eight weeks and 22 witnesses, the government rested its case against two former Enron chief executives, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay, setting the stage for the defense to take its turn. [C4.]    Michael W. Ramsey, the lead lawyer for Mr. Lay, had a stent, a metal tube that aids blood circulation, implanted on Friday night after doctors discovered a blockage in a coronary artery. [C4.]    New Fuel Standards to Cover Sport Utility Vehicles  The Transportation Department will announce a fuel economy standard for sport utility vehicles, vans and pickups on Wednesday that for the first time will cover vehicles above 8,500 pounds, and will differ in how it categorizes vehicles, according to people briefed on the rule. [C9.]    Consumer Optimism Highest in Nearly Four Years  Americans' optimism in the economy rebounded in March, sending a widely followed barometer of consumer sentiment close to a four-year high, a private research group said. The Conference Board said that its consumer index rose 4.5 points, to 107.2, the highest level since May 2002. [C15.]    A Preliminary Union Vote at German Software Concern  On Thursday, 9,000 employees of SAP, a German software company, will take what could be the first step toward bringing unions into the company with a vote on a committee that will later hold an election for a works council, a legal entity that represents workers. The chief executive, Henning Kagermann, left, noted that in a recent election, 91 percent of the employees opposed a union, but he acknowledged that German law allows employees to petition for a union. [C7.]    Tobacco Companies and States Negotiating a Payment  Negotiations are under way between the states and the nation's largest tobacco companies over whether the companies have met conditions to reduce payments to the states and as a result whether they are legally bound to pay the states more than $1 billion by mid-April. [A18.]    Stocks Fall After Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates  Stocks fell after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and signaled that further increases were ahead. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 95.57 points, to 11,154.54; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 8.38 points, to 1,293.23; and the Nasdaq composite index declined 11.12, to 2,304.46. [C9.]    Seven Arrested in Crackdown on Credit Card Data Theft  The Secret Service announced seven arrests in five states and the District of Columbia as part of a crackdown on online forums where credit card data and other stolen consumer information is routinely traded. [C4.]    Consumer Groups Criticize Beer Industry Panel for Ads  Several consumer groups say that the voluntary standards for beer advertising set up by the Beer Institute, an industry trade group, are little more than a public relations ploy and do not go far enough in trying to cut down on beer ads seen by people under 21. [C4.]    Cable TV News and the Opinions of Lou Dobbs  In one 24-hour period, the newscaster Lou Dobbs insistently offered his ever more passionate views on immigration all across the television landscape, underscoring that what works in cable television news is not an objective analysis of the day's events but hard-nosed, unstinting advocacy of a specific point of view on a sizzling hot topic.

With media and technology companies eager to capitalize, video content for portable players has been popping up in the last year in various ways.

Though Ukraine was widely seen as a winner in the dispute after forcing Russia to about-face on its natural gas embargo after one day, and then negotiating a price lower than most other former Soviet states pay, Ms. Tymoshenko said she would work to scuttle the deal because it transfers control of energy imports to a company she calls corrupt.

The announcement leaves Boston Scientific as the apparent winner of Guidant, which makes defibrillators and other implantable devices that regulate heartbeats.

The company said net income for the fourth quarter more than tripled to $499 million, or 26 cents a share, but that was largely because of lower tax costs. As uncertainties seemed to mount, Bristol-Myers predicted lower sales and earnings for 2006, with generic competition and patent losses weighing down sales.

It will turn, instead, on serious but relatively routine questions about trade secrets and civil procedure.

Experts said they believed that Israel would now be freer to pursue unilateral action, drawing its own borders and separating itself from the Palestinians. Israel's own election in March could also be heavily influenced by the results of the Palestinian election.      NEWS ANALYSIS, BY GREG MYRE, PAGE A10"

Wall Street firms set records last year, but this year seems to be shaping up even better. Goldman Sachs is expected to lead the way with spectacular numbers, particularly in stock and bond underwriting (Tuesday), followed by Lehman Brothers (Wednesday) and Bear Stearns (Thursday.)    WIZ AT MATH -- Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, will try to pull a few more coins from behind consumers' ears with the two-disc DVD release of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth installment in the very lucrative Harry Potter franchise. (Tuesday.)    RETAIL SALES -- After retail sales jumped 2.3 percent in January, analysts are not quite so sanguine about February sales. January's sales were jet-fueled by postholiday sales and the new rite of the gift-giving season: going back to the mall to cash in gift cards. (Tuesday.)    BIGGER OIL -- Executives from the big oil companies seem to spend as much of their time on Capitol Hill as they do in their corner offices. This week, executives will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, addressing the question of whether consolidation in the industry has contributed to higher gasoline prices. They may also check the committee's fluids, wash its windshield and ask if it wants an oil change. (Tuesday.)    BACK PAGES -- Two book-selling giants, Barnes and Noble and Borders, will see whose best-seller list is longer this week when both report earnings. (Thursday.)    HIGHER PRICES -- The Consumer Price Index took a big 0.7 leap in January, bringing its 12-month increase to 4 percent. Those are the kind of numbers that give inflation watchers something more than pause but less than a fright. Expect a lot of furrowed brows at the Federal Reserve as economists wait for the consumer price number for February. (Thursday.)

The changes, detailed in Wal-Mart's fourth-quarter earnings announcement, threw a spotlight on the increasingly important role of one man: Eduardo Castro-Wright, the new head of Wal-Mart's United States operations, who is a popular figure within the company because of his success transforming the retailer's Mexican division into one of the company's most profitable units. [C1.]    A Rise in Home Foreclosures Among Minorities  The housing boom of the last decade helped push minority home ownership rates past 50 percent for the first time in 2004 and the overall foreclosure rate below 1 percent. But hidden behind such success stories lies a disturbing trend: In the last several years, neighborhoods with large poor and minority populations have experienced a sharp rise in foreclosures, according to an analysis of court filings and other housing data by The New York Times and academic researchers. [A1.]    A Reprieve for Lawyers Known for Investor Suits  The famed class-action lawyer William S. Lerach and his former partner Melvyn I.

That was welcome relief. But the two lawyers and the law firm they once ran together, people close to the investigation say, remain a focus of the inquiry.

[A11.]    E.On, a German Utility, Bids for Endesa of Spain  The German utility E.On announced a surprise bid of 29.1 billion euros to acquire the Spanish electricity company Endesa, a move that would create one of the world's largest power and natural gas companies and drive consolidation in Europe as regulators seek greater competition in the sector. E.On's offer trumped an earlier 22 billion euro, or $26.3 billion, hostile bid by the Spanish company Gas Natural and upset plans by the Spanish government to forge a national energy champion. ''In strategic terms, this transaction is a major step forward for the E.On Group in delivering its vision to create the world's leading power and gas company,'' the chief executive, Wulf Bernotat, above, said at a news conference in Madrid, where Endesa is based.

They deserve the kudos because they could be deemed responsible for the marked improvement in the commercials during Super Bowl XL last night. The fact that the spots are to be made widely available -- on Web sites, for downloading, as video-on-demand programs -- outside the broadcast of the game on ABC, seemed to inspire advertisers and agencies to broaden the appeal beyond the typical male football fanatic, who stays glued to the set to giggle at ads with jiggling cheerleaders or flatulent horses.

Visteon reported net income of $1.34 billion, or $10.25 a share, for the fourth quarter, in contrast to a net loss of $138 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter sales fell to $2.87 billion, from $4.68 billion a year earlier, mainly because of the sale of operations to Ford. Excluding the gain and other one-time items, Visteon reported a loss of $102 million in the quarter. The deal with Ford helped Visteon avoid falling into bankruptcy. Production cuts and price reductions in North America hurt quarterly results for Visteon, which was spun off by Ford in 2000. The Ford bailout is partly financing Visteon's latest three-year restructuring plan. Visteon expects the plan to cost about $650 million, down from its previous estimate of $800 million, the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Visteon also raised its 2006 outlook and said it expected the improvement to continue in 2007. (REUTERS)    Vice Chairman of Ford Motor Announces Retirement  The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that its vice chairman, Gregory C. Smith, was retiring, effective March 1. Mr. Smith, left, is the latest in a series of executives to leave the company, which is in the midst of a corporate restructuring. The company said Mr. Smith, 54, will remain a consultant to the company. As vice chairman, Mr. Smith directs central corporate staffs, including human resources and labor affairs. He joined the company as an engineer in 1973. Before being elected a vice chairman, he was the head of Ford's Americas operations, a position he held for 19 months before being succeeded by Mark Fields. (REUTERS)    $371 Million Awarded in Meritor Bank Seizure  A federal claims court judge awarded $371.7 million yesterday to investors who sued the federal government over the 1992 seizure of Meritor Savings Bank. Judge Loren A. Smith of the United States Claims Court in Washington determined the award and indicated that Meritor investors might deserve an additional $402 million, but he left that question to be resolved upon appeal. A Justice Department spokesman, Charles Miller, said government officials were still reviewing the decision and had not yet decided on a response. Investors sued in 1993 after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized Meritor. Gary Hindes, whose New York investment firm is a major Meritor shareholder, said the decision would amount to $6.75 a share. (AP)    Identity Theft Results in a 10-Year Sentence  A Nigerian national who pleaded guilty to identity theft charges related to information stolen from ChoicePoint Inc. was sentenced yesterday to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay $6.5 million in restitution. The sentence was given to Olatunji Oluwatosin, 42, of North Hollywood, Calif., by Judge Bob S. Bowers Jr. of Superior Court in Los Angeles. Mr. Oluwatosin pleaded guilty in December to conspiracy to commit computer access fraud and grand theft, the district attorney's office said in a statement. Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Oluwatosin set up phony businesses to get access to records of ChoicePoint, which disclosed last year that thieves had obtained data that compromised the security of more than 100,000 credit card accounts. (AP)    Bank of America Withdraws Some Visa Cards  The Bank of America Corporation has withdrawn an undetermined number of Visa cards because of concerns about a security breach with a merchant, a company spokeswoman said yesterday. ''We are in the process of notifying some customers,'' said Betty Riess, a spokeswoman for the bank. The bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., declined to reveal the number of cards that were withdrawn or the location of the customers. Ms. Riess also declined to identify the merchant. (AP)    Time Warner Shareholder Reduces Its Stake  Capital Research and Management, the largest institutional shareholder of Time Warner, has reduced its stake in the company. Capital Research, the manager of the American Funds family of mutual funds, owned about 190 million shares of Time Warner, or a 4.2 percent stake, as of Dec. 31, 2005, the company said yesterday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm, whose director, Gordon Crawford, is an influential media figure who once called for the removal of the America Online co-founder Stephen M. Case as the chairman of Time Warner, cut its stake from 239 million shares, or about 5.3 percent, as of Sept. 30, 2005. At the end of 2004, the firm held a 7.5 percent stake, or about 332 million shares, a company spokesman said. Time Warner is facing a proxy battle waged by the financier Carl C. Icahn, who this week called for the breakup of the company into four groups. (REUTERS)    Profit Down but Subscribers Rise at Cincinnati Bell  The regional telephone company Cincinnati Bell posted lower quarterly profit as a result of restructuring charges yesterday but reported a strong increase in wireless and high-speed Internet subscribers. The company, which sells fixed-line and wireless phone services in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, reported a profit of $12.6 million, or 4 cents a share, compared with $20.9 million, or 7 cents a share, a year earlier. Cincinnati Bell said fourth-quarter revenue rose 2 percent, to $305.3 million, and forecast 2006 revenue of $1.2 billion. The company's stock rose 30 cents, or 8.7 percent, to $3.76. (REUTERS)    A Cancer Drug Is Approved for Broader Treatment  The biotechnology companies Genentech and Biogen Idec said yesterday that federal regulators had approved their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma drug, Rituxan, to treat an additional form of the disease. The companies now will be able to sell the drug for use in combination with standard chemotherapy as an initial treatment for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a fast-growing form of the disease. Rituxan was first approved in 1997 to treat patients with a slower developing low-grade lymphoma who had previously received treatment and relapsed. (REUTERS)  "

[Page C1.]    Challenges Ahead for Paramount Chief  Brad Grey says he has a plan for reviving Paramount, which in 2004 ranked a dismal seventh in domestic box office receipts. He will buy good scripts, bet heavily on talented executives and filmmakers and, he hopes, watch the money follow. But with more pink slips to be handed out next week, it may be difficult for Mr. Grey to quell the criticism that has persisted for nearly a year at Paramount.

[C3.]    Video Game Industry Loses Some Sales Power  In an industry that has a reputation for growth, a fall-off in video game sales is clashing with expectations. [C1.]    A Spotlight on Super Bowl Commercials  The fact that Super Bowl ads are now made widely available outside the broadcast of the game -- on Web sites, for downloading and as video-on-demand programs -- seemed to inspire advertisers and agencies to broaden their appeal beyond the typical male football fanatic. To be sure, some spots were aimed at the lowest common denominator, but refreshingly, they were outnumbered by spots reaching for a higher form of hilarity or trying to tug at the heartstrings. A commercial for Burger King, above, made fun of musical production numbers. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C5.]    Companies Await Ruling on Biotech Food  The battle over agricultural biotechnology could reach a tipping point this week, when the World Trade Organization is expected to render its verdict on charges by the United States that Europe is illegally restricting imports of genetically modified crops. The American government and the biotechnology industry hope that a ruling in their favor, which is expected, would sound a warning to other nations not to follow Europe's lead in restricting farm biotechnology.

[C1.]    Trump Starts Travel Web Site Aimed at Bargain Hunters  Donald Trump recently introduced GoTrump.com, a Web site that promises bargains on airfares and hotels, and includes vacation tips from the Donald himself. GoTrump offers, among other things, ''affordable luxury'' vacation deals, like a nine-day South African trip for $2,000 per person, that are listed as being exclusive to the site. ''It doesn't matter how rich you are,'' said Mr. Trump. ''You don't want to be a fool and you want to get the best deal.'' He said he would offer the site's users exclusive access to deals at his hotels, although no such offerings were yet available. He also predicted that private jet operators would offer ''huge discounts'' on his site so they could avoid returning empty to their originating airports.

[C1.]    Japanese Companies Join to Strengthen Chip Industry  Japanese chip makers are trying to snap out of a decline by joining forces, either by sharing factory construction costs or through outright mergers. The latest move came last week, when the Japanese chip makers Hitachi, Toshiba and Renesas Technology announced that they were in talks to jointly build a semiconductor factory, a project that would be backed by the government. Japanese efforts to combine forces have failed in the past: a wave of mergers two years ago produced companies as unprofitable as their predecessors.

Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, needs to build 73 new mills to convert sugar cane into ethanol and to plant an additional 2.5 million hectares of cane, an increase of almost 50 percent, the agriculture minister, Roberto Rodrigues, said in Brasília. Brazil produces 5.5 million hectares of sugar cane, about half of which goes to produce ethanol, a motor fuel. Concern that more of the world's sugar cane crop will be used to produce ethanol and less for sugar sent raw sugar prices to a 24-year high in New York. In Brazil, ethanol is cheaper than gasoline. ''Ethanol is strategic for the country,'' Mr. Rodrigues told reporters in a hallway as he came out of a ministry meeting with Brazilian sugar and ethanol industry executives. He said he expected demand for ethanol to double over the next eight years.   "

Starr Tech, an insurance agency, is a subsidiary of C. V. Starr & Company, a closely held concern controlled by Maurice R. Greenberg, left, who was forced out as chairman and chief executive of A.I.G. last March after the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, began an investigation into accounting practices at the insurer. American International, which is based in New York, said that it ''terminated the agency relationship'' with Starr Tech. There was no immediate comment from Starr Tech. (AP)    Merrill Agrees to Settle Internet Research Suits  Merrill Lynch & Company will pay $164 million to settle 23 class-action lawsuits related to its analysts' activities and research coverage of Internet companies during the dot-com era, the company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company, which is based in New York, said terms and conditions were subject to further negotiations and required court approval. The settlements leave only two class-action suits remaining against Merrill Lynch, and the company said it planned to defend itself against those suits. Merrill Lynch will amend its fourth-quarter results to include a $170 million charge for the cost of the settlements, which will reduce fourth-quarter earnings by 10 cents a share and full-year 2005 earnings by 11 cents a share. (AP)    Campbell Soup Posts 8% Increase in Profit  Campbell Soup, the world's biggest soup maker, reported that second-quarter earnings were up 8 percent over the period a year earlier because of stronger sales and lower taxes. For the second consecutive year, Campbell announced price increases. This year, soup, sauce and beverage prices will be up by an average of 2.3 percent, the company said. Earnings increased to $254 million, or 61 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 29, up from $235 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 3 percent, to $2.28 billion, from $2.22 billion. (AP)    Gillette and Schick Settle Most of Their Razor Dispute  Gillette and Schick Wilkinson-Sword have settled most of a trade dispute over their competing razors, the companies said yesterday. The companies have been waging a legal battle since Schick introduced its Quattro four-blade razor in August 2003, with one more blade than Gillette's three-bladed Mach3 razor. Gillette filed a suit in Boston, claiming any razor with three or more blades violated its patent. Schick later filed a suit in Connecticut challenging Gillette's advertising claims. Details of the agreement reached last week were not disclosed. Gillette was acquired last year by Procter & Gamble of Cincinnati; Schick is a unit of Energizer Holdings of St. Louis. (AP)    PG&E's Profit Falls but Tops Analysts' Forecast  PG&E, owner of California's largest utility, said fourth-quarter profit fell 79 percent from a year ago, when the company had a gain related to a bankrupt unit. Net income fell to $180 million, or 49 cents a share, from $871 million, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue climbed to $3.73 billion, from $2.99 billion. Excluding one-time items, profit rose to 49 cents a share, from 44 cents a year ago and topped the 43 cents expected by analysts. PG&E, based in San Francisco, owns Pacific Gas & Electric. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)    Modest Rise in Wholesale Prices Last Month  Prices at the wholesale level rose moderately in January as a big drop in gasoline costs helped to offset price increases in other areas, a government report said yesterday. The Labor Department reported that wholesale inflation rose by 0.3 percent in January, just half of the 0.6 percent surge in December, reflecting a calming of energy prices. But core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, rose by 0.4 percent in January, the biggest one-month rise in a year. The 0.4 percent rise in core prices was the biggest increase since a 0.6 percent increase last January and followed 0.1 percent increases in November and December.

Gonzales said yesterday. Mr. Gonzales, left, told a news conference in Washington that the Justice Department's request was not an invasion of privacy and would help fight Internet pornography. The department sued Google this week, seeking one week's worth of Web searches and a million addresses in the company's database. ''We are trying to gather up information in order to help the enforcement of a federal law to ensure the protection, quite frankly, of our nation's children against pornography,'' Mr. Gonzales said. Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., is fighting the request, saying it could compromise trade secrets. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)    Supervalu Group Bidding Again for Albertson's  Albertson's Inc., the grocery chain, and Supervalu Inc. have resumed talks on a merger deal in which Albertson's would be acquired by a group led by Supervalu and the CVS Corporation, the companies said yesterday. The group also includes Cerberus Capital Management and the Kimco Realty Corporation. A price was not disclosed but Albertson's has a market value of $8.93 billion and about $5.63 billion in debt. A transaction would give Supervalu, a discount grocer, more than 1,100 new stores in urban markets, including Chicago, and allow CVS, the drugstore chain, to add 700 stores, mostly in the West. Supervalu, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., currently operates more than 1,500 stores in 40 states. Albertson's, based in Boise, Idaho, put itself up for sale in September and nearly reached an agreement in December to be acquired for $9.6 billion by the same group, but those talks fell apart for reasons that were not disclosed. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)    Danaher to Acquire a British Sensor Maker  The Danaher Corporation, a maker of electronic testing equipment, agreed yesterday to buy a sensor company, First Technology, for £251 million ($441 million), topping an offer from Honeywell International. Danaher will pay 330 pence a share for First Technology, which makes gas detection gear, auto controls and crash test dummies, the company said. The price is £44 million more than Honeywell's bid last month. First Technology's board unanimously recommended Danaher's offer. Danaher, based in Washington, has completed at least 11 acquisitions in the last two years, with a total value of more than $1.49 billion. Shares of First Technology, based in Egham, near London, surged 27 percent, to 351 pence, 21 pence more than Danaher's bid, suggesting investors think a higher bid might be forthcoming. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)    Nuclear Plant Owner Fined for Hiding Damage  The owner of an Ohio nuclear plant agreed to pay $28 million in fines, restitution and community service yesterday over the cover-up of an acid leak that nearly ate through the reactor vessel's 6-inch-thick steel cap. The owner, the FirstEnergy Corporation, acknowledged that workers at its Davis-Besse plant, on Lake Erie about 30 miles east of Toledo, had concealed the damage. A federal grand jury indicted two former Davis-Besse employees and a contractor on Thursday on charges of hiding the damage from regulators. FirstEnergy also agreed to adopt certain safety standards at the plant and was prohibited from passing the fine along to its customers. (AP)    Siemens Subsidiary Charged With Fraud in Chicago  A subsidiary of Siemens and two of its executives have been indicted on charges of forming a sham partnership with a minority-owned company to land a $49 million county contract, federal prosecutors in Chicago said yesterday. The minority-owned company and its owner were also charged. Both were previously indicted on other charges. Siemens Medical Solutions USA was charged with fraudulently telling officials it was joining with minority-owned Faustech Industries in the bid to provide radiology equipment for a new hospital in Cook County. Prosecutors said Siemens had claimed the partnership with Faustech because county officials required bidders to have 30 percent minority ownership. According to the indictment, Siemens paid Faustech's owner, Faust Villazan, $500,000 to pose as a partner. A spokesman for Siemens said the company had broken no laws and would fight the charges. Mr. Villazan and Faustech have denied the charges. (AP)    Fourth-Quarter Profit Declined at Johnson Controls  Johnson Controls said yesterday that its earnings fell for the first time in almost five years in the fourth quarter, pulled down by expenses from its purchase of the York International Corporation and higher raw materials prices. Its forecast for second-quarter profit was lower than analysts' estimates, setting off an 8 percent decline in its stock price. Johnson Controls, which is the largest automotive seat maker, bought York's heating and air conditioning business to reduce its dependence on supplying auto companies. It expects sales from the climate control division to almost double in 2006. Johnson Controls, which is based in Milwaukee, said net income fell 1.8 percent, to $165.4 million, or 85 cents a share, and sales rose 14 percent, to $7.53 billion. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)    Pension Fund Opposes Bank's Proposed Stake Sale  The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, called on the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday to block a transaction between Sovereign Bancorp and Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain because shareholders were not allowed to vote on it. The pension fund backed the efforts of Sovereign's largest shareholder, Relational Investors, to stop the bank from selling a 19.8 percent stake to Santander for $2.4 billion. Sovereign, which is based in Philadelphia, plans to use proceeds from the Santander transaction to help buy the Independence Community Bank Corporation of Brooklyn for $3.6 billion. (REUTERS)"

Economists expect Thursday's figures to show that the imbalance narrowed to $65.9 billion, from $68.9 billion in October, the highest in history, making it all but certain that the deficit will top $700 billion for the year, up from 2004's record $618 billion.    GREENHOUSE GAS FORUM -- On Thursday, the United States and five Pacific nations -- Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea -- will open a new forum in Sydney, Australia, on global warming. The inaugural meeting of the group, the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, will discuss efforts to cut greenhouse gases that are believed to be responsible for rising world temperatures. Together, the six countries account for half of all greenhouse gas emissions. The energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, will head the American delegation.    ECONOMIC STRENGTH -- Forget the trade gap for a moment; statistics due Friday are likely to show that the economy is otherwise in pretty good shape. Producer prices for December are expected to have increased a modest 0.2 percent, further evidence that inflation is under control, while retail sales in December are projected to show a healthy 0.9 percent gain.    AUTO WOES CLOUD ANNUAL SHOW -- The North American International Auto Show, the industry's biggest annual event, opens to the public in Detroit on Saturday. The big players will be promoting hybrids, like General Motors' 2007 Saturn Vue Green Line and a Ford diesel-electric system that the company says will get 65 miles to the gallon. Already, however, the extravaganza is being overshadowed by the decline in sales, credit ratings and profit margins of America's automakers.    ODDS AND ENDS  -- In other coming attractions, the jury will resume deliberations today in the trial for accounting fraud of Walter Forbes, above, the former chairman of the Cendant Corporation. It said on Thursday that it was deadlocked. Japan, a reawakening economic giant, will publish its index of leading economic indicators on Wednesday.  Sony executives will meet in Hawaii this week to talk about ways to cut $17 billion in costs over the next three years to stem a tide of red ink.  Plaintiffs in a Cincinnati suburb who are fighting the seizure of their homes for the benefit of a developer will argue their case on Wednesday before the Ohio Supreme Court."
