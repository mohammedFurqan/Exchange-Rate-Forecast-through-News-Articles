But soothing words calculated to calm edgy voters and edgier financial markets will not soon repair the trauma of a week that began with the fracturing of the European currency system and ended with French voters approving by the narrowest of margins a single currency for Europe.   The delay may not be entirely a bad thing. For while the financial follies undermined prospects for a speedy transition to a common currency controlled by a common central bank, the crisis itself was precipitated by the model for that vision -- Germany's very independent Bundesbank. And skeptics are now in a better position to force an open debate on whether democratic Europe can afford to surrender its economic fate to the hands of a few unelected central bankers -- or, indeed, whether it can afford not to. Controlling the Flow    Central banks, like the Bank of France and the Bank of Japan, are in charge of their national supplies of money. They may not actually print it: in the modern world, money largely consists of deposits in checking accounts. But they can effectively control how much is available to borrow, and at what interest rate. And that in turn has enormous influence on the demand for everything from refrigerators to shopping malls."

Company officials and analysts say the loss, expected to be about $80 million, stems from severe pricing pressures in the semiconductor business and sluggishness in the computer business. In addition, analysts say, Fujitsu, which is heavily dependent on large mainframe computers, is facing some of the same pressures as its archrival, the International Business Machines Corporation, which has gone through wrenching pain as computers have become smaller and less expensive."

In doing so the Serbs dropped a long-standing precondition that Croatia recognize the rebel state's independence.   The agreement by the Serbians to abandon their insistence on independence as a starting point for talks and to accept negotiations on the basis of a ""special status"" within Croatia signals a dramatic departure from their often-repeated vow that the rebel Serbian republic's territory would never revert to Croatia."

The cuts were less than many political leaders and economists had hoped, but because high German rates have drawn money from other countries and stifled business investment, even the small step was welcomed around the world.  [ Page A1. ]   Germany's action was interpreted as a new willingness to respond to outside pressures and has opened a debate about whether the central bank has lost its independence.  [ D6. ]   The Bundesbank move was hailed as one that will spur world growth. But economists do not expect a quick turnaround.  [ D6. ]   Despite a devaluation of the lira by 7 percent, Italy's Prime Minister got no relief from critics of his economic policy.

[ D1. ]   Bond prices gained, but not as much as those overseas. Analysts said many traders were disappointed in the modest size of the German interest rate cuts.  [ D16. ]   Precious metals futures leaped on hopes that Germany's interest-rate cut would ignite higher inflation.  [ D17. ]  The dollar climbed against most currencies in New York and overseas.  [ D17. ]  International    The defense lawyer in a bank fraud trial accused the Bush Administration of manipulating the case to conceal ""blunders"" in its relationship with Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait.  [ D1. ]   The Administration offered Russia $1.15 billion in loan guarantees and food aid to buy American grain and livestock feed.  [ A6. ]   The French Government offered French voters a deal: it will lower interest rates if they ratify a treaty on European union.  [ A10. ]  The Economy    Two environmental groups have split over the North American Free Trade Agreement's conservation aspects and the Administration is likely to exploit the rift to gain passage of the pact.

Lower German rates would encourage world economic growth and help to stem the currency crisis in Europe.   Though the Bush Administration was actively urging Germany to ease its tight money policy last year, it has been relatively quiet recently, even as Europe's system of economic coordination seemed in near collapse this week. But a senior Administration official said the White House now saw in the European chaos an opportunity to ""demonstrate leadership"" on a high-profile economic issue and ""be a force for stability."""

He led the police on a televised chase for another day, until he was captured after taking an elderly couple hostage."

Scientists at Imatron Inc., a small medical technology company here, say they have developed a scanning device that can do just that.   Heart specialists who have used the device say it provides a reliable early indicator of coronary artery disease, or atherosclerosis, and can eliminate for some people the need for more painful, time-consuming and far more expensive tests like the angiogram. The need for such an indicator is compelling, they add, because for many of the 1.5 million people who have heart attacks in the United States annually, the first symptom is death. The situation is all the more tragic because if caught early enough, coronary artery disease can be slowed or reversed with diet changes or drugs."

So, should investors run out and buy up shares of any company that has large blocks in few hands? Well, not really. It's like much of Wall Street's conventional wisdom. True wisdom only comes in knowing when the conventions don't apply."

Their idea is a window-like product that will moderate temperature and light levels by turning transparent when the weather is cold, to allow in the sun, and translucent when it is warm and the sun must be blocked. It could be used initially for skylights and greenhouses, and ultimately for roofing in new kinds of buildings, like houses with living rooms where the attic used to be."

The free trade pact that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached this week will, if ratified, eliminate the taxes now imposed on tomatoes, cantaloupes, cucumbers and many other foods imported from Mexico. The taxes, or tariffs, are intended to protect American farmers from imports, and they add significantly to the price of these foods. The accord will also reduce transportation costs by opening long-haul cross-border truck routes to low-wage Mexican carriers.  Cheaper Roses    The agreement may even lower the cost of romance -- cutting out the 8 percent tax on cut roses from Mexico.   ""You will find a greater availability of fruits and vegetables in your store, and the prices will be lower,"" said Colin A.

Nash's letter (Sept. 13). His comments reflect common misconceptions among many physicians about screening for coronary atherosclerosis and a lack of familiarity of the recent literature dealing with coronary calcification and Ultrafast CT.   By quantifying the amount of coronary calcification with Ultrafast CT, the extent of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries can be determined before the onset of clinical disease. No other noninvasive technique has this capability. Autopsies and Ultrafast CT studies have shown marked differences in the amount of calcium present in those who have sustained heart attacks and those who have not at all age levels. A proposed ""double blind"" study of the use of Ultrafast CT was turned down by the National Institutes of Health in part because it was thought to be unethical to withhold treatment from the group with calcification. Similarly, there will never be a trial of angiography in which a control group with atherosclerosis does not receive medical therapy."

Analysts said the data were so grim the Fed had little choice, despite concerns that it would appear to be bowing to political pressure.  [ Page A1. ]  The news underscores a split on the President's staff over whether he should appear optimistic or sober on the economy. News Analysis.  [ A1. ]   The Labor Department said the nation's jobless rate spurted another three-tenths of a point in June, to 7.8 percent, while payroll jobs slumped 117,000. The figures were stunningly gloomy and challenged assumptions of continued economic recovery. Analysts found little comfort in data that included a shorter work week, lengthening spells of unemployment, more layoffs and a swelling in the ranks of the jobless by 470,000 to a total of just under 10 million.

Against the forces of profiteers in the $1 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, Germany and France battled to preserve the value of the French franc. They did it by digging deep into their currency reserves to buy francs on the open market. But success is not guaranteed since government resources are small compared with those of the world's currency traders. Yet defending the franc was more important than money; it was a show of unity after France's lukewarm endorsement of the Maastricht treaty. Europe ""is facing tests of strength that will be decisive for its common future,"" Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said. President Francois Mitterrand of France echoed the sentiments. The joint actions put ""all Franco-German irritations to bed,"" said Stephan-Gotz Richter, president of Trans Atlantic Futures, a consultant in Washington. Fleshing Out Health Care    Appearing before a group of employees at Merck & Company, the big pharmaceutical manufacturer in Rahway, N.J., Gov. Bill Clinton put a little flesh and blood on his health care plan. He told the group that if elected he would require private employers with more than 50 workers to provide health- care insurance for employees and would have the Federal Government supplement health care coverage for the unemployed. Mr. Clinton also said he would call for price controls on drugs. His plan would ""drastically simplify the administrative costs of the American health care system"" and save about $700 billion by the end of the decade, Mr. Clinton said. The plan would also provide incentives for small companies to band together to pool coverage and reduce costs, something President Bush has also proposed. The Bush campaign criticized Mr. Clinton's proposals, saying price controls on drugs would reduce private funding for research.   Time was when most of mahogany row went Republican. But last week Governor Clinton garnered endorsements from 400 of America's corporate titans. Among the endorsers were Paul Allaire, chairman of Xerox; Robert Haas, chairman of Levi Strauss; Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate Palmolive; Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, and the taste maker Martha Stewart. Paid to Do the Right Thing    While Mr. Clinton talked health care, President Bush was homing in on the nation's small business owners. He began by vetoing a family-leave bill that would require companies to grant at least 12 weeks of unpaid leave to any employee with a family emergency. The bill was opposed by many small-business owners who said it was too costly. ""I have always supported employer policies to give time off for a child's birth, adoption or for family illness,"" Mr. Bush said in his veto message. Instead of the bill, he proposed tax credits for employers who give workers time off. Later, in Greensboro N.C., Mr. Bush proposed $20 billion in tax cuts for small businesses. Durable Goods Decline    Orders for durable goods, those big-ticket items that are supposed to last three years , fell 0.1 percent in August, the third monthly decline in four months. The report was ""Weak, weak, weak,"" said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. In Need of an Economic Miracle    Dogging the Presidential race is the sluggish economy. It grew by 1.5 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. ""The calendar is running out for George Bush,""said Robert G. Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. Daring to Offend China    Time was when President Bush couldn't do enough for China. He supported its most-favored-nation trade status against and fought Congressional pressure to put sanctions on it after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. But with the election looming, old loyalties have been called into question. Last month, Mr. Bush authorized the sale of 150 F-16's to Taiwan, China's longtime foe. Last week, he agreed to sell 12 SH-2F ""Lamp"" helicopters to Taiwan for $161 million. The helicopters, which can detect and attack submerged submarines, are made by the Kaman Corporation in Bloomfield, Conn. Connecticut -- whose eight electoral votes are considered up for grabs -- has been severely hurt by cutbacks in Pentagon spending. Japan's Bank Won't Budge    In Japan, they are calling it a recession even though growth has so far not turned negative. Japan's gross domestic product expanded by a meek 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the Ministry of Finance said last week. Pleading for Fewer Rubles    Russia is learning about democracy the hard way. Yegor T. Gaidar, the acting Prime Minister , is dedicated to establishing a market system, but he must contend with a Parliament still dominated by proponents of central planning. And while Mr. Gaidar has been trying to keep money growth slow, Parliament appointed Viktor Gerashenko as head of Russia's central bank. Mr. Gerashenko likes to keep those printing presses running. As a result, since last month, the value of the ruble has lost 49 percent of its value. Last week Mr. Gaidar pleaded with Parliament, saying that unless the money supply was tightened, the Russian monetary system would collapse. Agency Hopping at Olds?     Leo Burnett U.S.A., the advertising agency, has been selling Oldsmobiles since 1967. A few years ago it came up with the ""This is not your father's Oldsmobile"" theme. But the campaign alienated the car company's older customers without bringing in new ones. Oldsmobile's sales are sluggish, to say the least. Last week, the General Motors Corporation put the Oldsmobile account up for review. Although it did not announce which agencies would be allowed to compete for the account, which is worth $100 million to $110 million, it said Leo Burnett would be in the running. ""We are confident we can retain the Oldsmobile business,"" said Jim Oates, Burnett's chairman. Perhaps it will. The last time G.M. dismissed an agency was in 1958.    G.M. has been working hard to keep the labor peace. But last month, after announcing plans to close plants, lay off workers and buy parts from outside suppliers, workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, struck. And last week, 4,200 members of the United Automobile Workers union went on strike at a body stamping plant in Lansing, Mich., for the same reasons. Cracks in the Rock of Gibraltar    The Prudential Insurance Company may like to portray itself as solid as the rock of Gibraltar, but according to an independent nonprofit research agency, its losses from Hurricane Andrew so far total $1.2 billion -- four times what executives predicted. Those losses could use up 10 percent of Prudential's capital. The estimates caused alarm among analysts at Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency, placed it on credit watch with the possibility of downgrading Prudential from AAA, the highest rating. ""We have always felt that Prudential was stretched on capital relative to the rating,"" said Mark Puccia, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's. Earlier this year, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the nation's No. 1 insurer from Aaa, for exceptional , to Aa1, for excellent. The Pseudo-Sodas    With the fizz going out of the Coca-Cola Company's sales, its third-quarter financial forecasts were, well, flat. One of Coke's answers is to go New Age. Following a host of competitors, Coca-Cola will bring out a new drink in the fast-growing ""clear"" category, to be called Nordic Mist. The new drink, a flavored sparkling water, will follow Pepsi Cola's H2oH! and Pepsi Crystal and the Seagrams entry, Quest. But while Nordic Mist will be clear, it won't be a health food. It will derive its sweet taste (not to mention 112 calories) from high-fructose corn syrup. ""It's soft drinks in disguise,"" said Jack Trout of Trout & Ries, a marketing firm in Greenwich, Conn. Shoring Up Travelers    The Primerica Corporation, the big financial services and insurance company, said last week that it would invest $722.5 million in the struggling Travelers Corporation in return for a 27 percent stake in the company. Primerica's chairman, Sanford I. Weill, said he would work with Travelers to direct its operations. More than a third of its $13 billion in outstanding mortgages are in trouble. Behind the Scenes at 'Tonight'    The way Ken Kragen tells it -- he's a Hollywood artists' manager -- Helen Kushnick plays too rough. Ms. Kushnick was Jay Leno's manager, and when he became host of the ""The Tonight Show"" earlier this year, became executive producer. Mr. Kragen said Ms. Kushnick kept one of his clients, the country singer Travis Tritt, off ""The Tonight Show"" after learning that Mr. Tritt was also appearing on the rival ""Arsenio"" show. What was even worse, Mr. Kragen said, was that for no reason other than vindictiveness, Ms. Kushnick canceled a scheduled appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" by Trisha Yearwood, another country singer whom Mr. Kragen represents. Ms. Kushnick denied Mr. Kragen's assertions about her motivations. That denial was not enough for NBC. Last week the network dismissed Ms. Kushnick."

Yet the fallout is still widely apparent, and every time calm begins to reign on the harassment front itself, something makes it roar back to life: most recently the Tailhook scandal, involving hundreds of naval aviators, and testimony before Congress late last month that harassment of women in occupations dominated by men -- among those who gave testimony were a garbage-truck driver and a math professor -- is endemic.   Just enough time has elapsed since the hearings to allow the publishing industry -- itself a notorious domain of sexual predation -- to crank out the first post-hearings wave of books on sexual harassment.

The Government twice raised interest rates in a desperate bid to save the pound, before retreating in failure and dropping out of European monetary system, allowing the pound to fall in value."

FoxMeyer, the nation's third-largest distributor of pharmaceuticals, is owed $74 million by Phar-Mor, the deep-discount retailer that sought court protection from creditors last Monday. Donald T. Spindel, an analyst at A. G.

Its departure from the monetary system, a cornerstone of greater European unity, left the program of economic coordination in tatters.   Before taking that unexpected step, which effectively allowed the pound to drop sharply in value, Britain desperately tried to pump up the currency. First it raised one of its key interest rates to 12 percent from 10 percent. Only hours later -- after the pound had sunk still further -- it announced another increase, to 15 percent. By raising rates so sharply, Britain hoped to make the pound more attractive to investors and stop concerted selling by speculators that was pushing it down."

April's rioting in Los Angeles gave impetus to the legislation, which would include a series of incentives for businesses to invest in impoverished urban neighborhoods, creating what are known as enterprise zones. But supporters of the measure said its prospects have been damaged since it was last considered on the Senate floor nearly two months ago. President Bush, trying hard to reinvigorate his sagging re-election campaign, has hardened his anti-tax position."

Others say it arises from the determination of Serbian nationalists to pursue a policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" wherever they can."

General Dynamics, in turn, justifies the sale with the view that it is much more likely to profit from making submarines or warplanes than missiles.   Thus are two of America's leading military contractors trying to adjust to the Federal Government's shrinking outlays for defense, now that the cold war is over. Rather than leave the business -- by converting weapons factories to the production of consumer goods -- the industry is trying to divide a smaller pie. And in the process, giant operations that have turned out elaborate weaponry for four decades are going through radical change."

Really Evolve?","  EVERYONE knows what happened to the dinosaurs that once ruled the earth, and no one more so than the International Business Machines Corporation, which last week pressed ahead with its attempt to evolve into a sprightlier, swifter life form.   I.B.M., the biggest dinosaur in the computer industry, split off its personal computer operations into a separate operating unit, called the I.B.M. Personal Computer Company.    ""It's like a whale trying to crawl up on the beach, shed some weight, and walk like a man,"" said William M. Bluestein, senior analyst for the Forrester Group, a research company in Cambridge, Mass.    The beach is in Somers, N.Y., down the road from Armonk, where I.B.M. has its headquarters in the suburbs north of New York City.   Not exactly a startup, the new company comes to life with 10,000 veteran employees, a well-established brand name and current revenues of an estimated $7 billion a year. It also comes with a senior management team trained in the ""Iron Age"" of I.B.M., when mainframes dominated the corporate computing landscape.    If all goes according to plan, the new company will eventually become a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent, free to prosper or fail on its own strengths and weaknesses. The goal of the current quasi-independent company is ""to increase efficiencies and focus and improve our responsiveness in a fast-changing PC marketplace,"" said James A. Cannavino, an I.B.M. vice president who oversees all personal computer systems operations, including the new company.    Just how independent will the I.B.M. Personal Computer Company be? Will it be able to buy disk drives, microprocessors, memory chips and circuit boards from sources other than the International Business Machines Corporation? Will it pre-install the Microsoft Corporation's Windows and Windows NT on its systems, perhaps in place of I.B.M.'s own OS/2? Will it be free to develop powerful desktop PC's and boast that they will, dollar for dollar, outperform I.B.M. mid-range systems?    Should it take these bold moves, it would be doing nothing more remarkable than the competition.    Another point to ponder is whether the I.B.M. Personal Computer Company will be bound by the same ""no layoffs"" employment rules of the parent corporation, or whether Mr. Cannavino will be free to act quickly to trim his large work force, should he find the need.    In the past, several I.B.M. executives have acknowledged privately, the personal computer division had to wage long, bureaucratic battles with other I.B.M. business units to make even minor changes in technology, pricing or marketing. These executives say it was a cultural hallmark of I.B.M. to require managers and engineers to defend new ideas in something akin to a technological and bureaucratic gantlet.   The theory was that only the strongest and best ideas would survive the review process. But it often took months before innovations were approved or rejected.   The result was that I.B.M. has been slow to reach the market with new technologies, and slower still to respond to challenges from its rivals. Some competitors boasted that they could give I.B.M. a six-month head start with a new computer chip and still beat it to market -- at lower prices and with more features. The difference was not in technical or manufacturing skills -- I.B.M.'s resources in those areas are believed to be second to none -- but in I.B.M.'s management structure, which, for all its strengths, is hardly nimble.    In the brave new world of the I.B.M. Personal Computer Company, Mr. Cannavino says, decisions on product development, technology, sales and marketing will be largely insulated from the other I.B.M. divisions. By 1994, I.B.M. itself says, the personal computer company's balance sheets will be reported independently.    ""The structure is now more reasonable, but what counts is not the structure but the products,"" said Will Zachman, president of Canopus Research of Duxbury, Mass. ""Reorganizations in themselves don't do anything; it's what you do after the reorganization. The keys are good products, aggressive pricing, and a well-known name backed by service and support.   Customers will not have to wait long to see the results. On Tuesday, the I.B.M. Personal Computer Company will make the first of a series of product introductions, bringing forward several PS/1 home computers that will use either an Intel Corporation 486 microprocessor or an I.B.M. variation of it. Originally offered as a simplified version of the PS/2 line, lacking the power and features of interest to business customers, the new PS/1's are said to be quite powerful.   I.B.M. has been coy about what it will announce, but in subsequent weeks, according to the reports in the trade press, the company is expected to overhaul its PS/2 series of business computers, introduce new notebook and pen-based portable systems, and create a new brand name -- PS/ Valuepoint -- for a line of computers that will compete directly against the clones that have battered I.B.M. for years.   The PS/Valuepoint machines are said to be based on I.B.M.'s original PC-AT design, which the company largely abandoned in 1987 when it created the PS/2 series. That AT design, marketed as I.B.M.-compatible even after Big Blue had walked away from it, has generated billions of dollars in sales for I.B.M.'s competitors, and I.B.M.'s share of the market has plummeted.    ""The company has the opportunity to regain market share, not the commanding role it had, but a strong role,"" Mr. Zachman said.   Obviously, these products were in development under the old system, and probably under the same leadership. Mr. Cannavino joined I.B.M. as an engineer in 1963. The president of the I.B.M. Personal Computer Company is Robert J. Corrigan, who joined I.B.M. as an engineer in 1962.  (He will have day-to-day responsibility for running the company and will report to Mr. Cannavino.) And the head of the new company's North American operations is Sam M. Inman 3d, a 20-year I.B.M. veteran.    ""If you have a $7 billion company, it's a real company right off the bat,"" said David B. Jemison, professor of management at the Graduate School of Business at the University of Texas and a specialist in business strategy. ""You can't populate it with new people, so they all come from the same gene pool.   ""The question is,"" he continued, ""how do we change old habits, and can you really change old habits with the same people? It can happen, if indeed in the old situation there were constraints that were keeping them from doing the things they wanted.""   Philip C. Rueppel, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a brokerage in New York, commented: ""They have removed many of the organizational roadblocks and fully understand their costs. What's left is an organization that has the potential of truly being much more responsive.""   Mr. Bluestein, who imagines the whale walking ashore, focuses on the word potential. ""Basically, it doesn't mean anything until I.B.M. addresses certain fundamental questions in the PC market,"" he said. ""If they don't shed the ingrained culture, they're just transferring all the same people, with all the same problems and headaches, into a new procedure. Whether this reorganization unclogs their arteries for decision-making and product development is really the question.""    Some of I.B.M.'s competitors have tried, in similar fashion, to unclog their corporate arteries.    Eckhardt Pfeiffer, shortly before he was named chief executive of the Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston, was chatting with two mid-level employees at a trade show last year when they said they were sure Compaq could build high-quality computers at less cost. The two wandered the show and were quoted prices for components that were less than what Compaq, a $3 billion company, was paying.   Mr. Pfeiffer asked the employees to form a secret ""swat team,"" free from executive review and unrestrained by typical Compaq procedures, with a mandate to design a line of computers to battle the lower-cost clones, which had done to Compaq what Compaq had done to I.B.M. Other senior Compaq officials now confirm that they did not know of the group until months later, when the team presented Mr. Pfeiffer with the design for Compaq's Prolinea series. The Prolineas have proven so popular that Compaq cannot meet demand.   The Digital Equipment Corporation of Maynard, Mass., perhaps the biggest dinosaur other than I.B.M., was being nibbled to death, and in a bold move earlier this year, it formed a new company, Digital Direct, patterned after direct marketers like the Dell Computer Corporation of Austin, Tex.    By breaking from its corporate mold, Digital Direct has been able to sustain hardware sales of $10 million a week, according to industry analysts who have attended Digital briefings. In other words, personal computers went from a negligible part of Digital's business to bringing in revenues at an annual rate of $500 million, in less than a year. That may not be enough to insure that Digital escapes the tar pits, but it is a promising sign.   The irony is that even if this latest step in I.B.M.'s grand experiment succeeds, the company will only be learning from itself.    More than a decade ago, because of suspicion that the personal computer market would never amount to much -- maybe 50,000 machines for hobbyists, one projection held -- I.B.M. allowed Don Estridge to form a small team to work independently in Boca Raton, Fla. The result, introduced in 1981, was the phenomenally successful I.B.M. PC. Later, when the success of the PC was apparent, I.B.M. reined the division back into the corporate fold, and it has paid ever since for that decision."

After eight hours of often acerbic debate, Mr. Major and his Cabinet won a narrow vote of confidence, 330 to 288.

Prices for gas contracts rose sharply on Friday, and analysts predicted that customers in the Northeast and Midwest would see bigger heating bills this winter. In addition, some analysts said Andrew's ravages may have ended a long depression in the natural gas market.

Several said the damage was more intense than anything they had ever seen, and the faces of corporate leaders from Allstate, State Farm, Prudential, Aetna and other companies turned expressionless at the destruction.

A Houston oilman, Ernest H. Cockrell, joined the billionaire, Jay Pritzker, and his son, Thomas, and two other wealthy investors, Dan Lufkin and Mel Klein, in a partnership last week to buy reserves that major oil companies have on the auction block.   Mr. Cockrell, a third-generation oilman, is in a position that leaves other producers envious.

The managed-care strategy has great appeal but, unfortunately, it just won't do the job.  The reason is simple. The problem of rising health costs is not caused by the proliferation of useless services but rather by the rapid introduction of valuable and extremely expensive new technology.

But in the long run, the move into generics by major manufacturers may squeeze some competitors out of the market, which could mean prices will not fall as sharply as they might have otherwise.

When burned, the Borneo coal produces less carbon dioxide than most coals. Carbon dioxide is a gas that scientists believe contributes to the ""greenhouse effect,"" which could alter the earth's climate. If using the new coal eliminated the need for ""scrubbers"" that clean coal smoke, even less carbon dioxide would be created because the chemical process of removing sulfur from coal smoke also releases carbon dioxide."

But more fundamentally, the chaos occurred because of an underlying crisis afflicting the economies of Europe. The crisis is rooted in the high cost of German unification, which is driving up German interest rates at a time when other European countries need lower rates to help them out of their economic slowdown."

Casting wary glances in both directions from his office there, Peter V. Ueberroth is issuing perhaps the most direct challenge yet to the business world to tackle the problems of the inner city.   The strategy he is pursuing as the group's chairman is as risky as it is ambitious. Mr. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, said he is counting on considerable help from residents of the community and from the state and Federal governments. But his thrust is clearly to prove that companies, motivated not solely by civic duty but also by cold profit-and-loss calculations, can revive urban America in a way that governments by themselves have failed to do."

The space agency has paid for a study on sonic booms that uses the same speakers that the pop singer used on his last tour.   The study, being conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology, is designed to measure the impact of sonic booms on people and buildings. The research is a small piece of the space agency's program to develop a supersonic commercial airplane larger and faster than the Concorde.   The shape of a plane has an impact on the loudness of sonic booms, explosive noises that are an unwelcome byproduct of traveling faster than the speed of sound. By studying the sonic booms, and their effect on domestic bliss, Georgia Tech hopes to help designers determine the ideal shape for an airplane that would produce the least offensive booms. Wall of Monster Speakers    At the heart of the study is a wall of speakers made by Intersonics Inc., in Northbrook, Ill. The speakers are several hundred times more powerful than the speakers in most living rooms, said Thomas Danley, the general manager of Intersonics. The rock group U2 is currently using 16 of the monster speakers to blast audiences on its current world tour."

Mr. Kuwabara did not get very far with his attempt at ritual suicide. The police say the wound was not deep and he will live. But his protest was vivid enough to force an embarrassing dispute into the headlines.

Monus and his father, Nathan, as owners of the new Major League Baseball franchise in Denver would not affect the club's plans to begin playing next year.   Michael Monus withdrew as an owner Monday after charges that he and another senior executive had embezzled funds and falsified profits at Phar-Mor Inc., a drugstore chain based in Youngstown, Ohio, he helped found. He and his father and three other general partners had put up $26 million of the Rockies' $95 million franchise fee. Much of the rest came from eight limited partners."
