The Russian Government moved hastily last week to avert financial collapse with a series of drastic measures, including delaying payments for 90 days on foreign debt owed mostly by banks, a restructuring of Government bonds and the sacrifice of the ruble to market forces. The value of the Russian currency is now free to float as low as 9.5 to the dollar, a risky step -- tantamount to devaluation -- that many people fear could prompt a new round of inflation. It could also wipe out as much as a third of the ruble's purchasing power in an economy heavily dependent on imports. The decision came after a request for $22.6 billion from the West was turned down. Standard & Poor's cut Russia's long-term foreign-currency debt rating by two notches. For this beggar at a McDonald's in Moscow, the collapsing ruble was not of immediate concern.    THE MARKET  A Roller-Coaster Ride  The global economic crisis and the aftermath of United States strikes on Afghanistan and the Sudan ravaged Wall Street stocks on Friday. After rising strongly early last week, the Dow fell slightly on Wednesday, more than 80 points on Thursday, and another 77.76 points on Friday, to close the week at 8533.65. Earlier on Friday the Dow had been down more than 200 points. The ups and downs over the week left some traders holding their heads."

The agreement, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, would create the world's third-largest multinational oil company in net income, after Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The combination is expected to create a formidable competitor. B.P. is known for its skill at finding oil in the North Sea and elsewhere around the world, while Amoco's strength is in refining its products into oil and chemicals and distributing them to consumers.

The company, which serves telephone customers from Maine to Virginia, agreed to guarantee job security to its union workers -- even in digital technologies only now being developed. Experts in labor relations called it a significant union victory. Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University, said workers in other industries were likely to be inspired by Bell Atlantic's agreement to phase out a nonunion customer service operation in Virginia."

The nation's manufacturers have slowed production to the lowest rate of growth since 1995, the clearest impact so far of the Asian crisis on the American economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing activity weakened in June for a majority of the companies that it surveys each month. It was the first time in 22 months that a majority had reported weakening instead of strengthening in their businesses. Manufacturing employment has fallen in recent months, and industrial production has slowed to an annual growth rate of less than 2 percent, down from 6 percent last year. Production is slowing in large part because stockpiles of unsold goods have surged, but also because companies are becoming worried that the economic boom cannot continue at the fervent pace of the last two years. Separately, the index of leading economic indicators was flat in May, a sign that growth will moderate in the coming months."

In its continuing antitrust investigation of Microsoft, the Government is looking into whether the company used its market muscle to force Intel, its only real peer, to shelve new-technology efforts that conflicted with Microsoft's ambitions. Federal and state investigators were said to have taken depositions from key Intel employees, including Andrew S. Grove, the chairman, left. Microsoft contends that the investigators are trying to portray routine business meetings as attempts to forge an anti-competitive conspiracy."
