In what appears to be a sweeping victory for Apple, Judge Vaughn R. Walker of the Federal District Court in San Francisco threw out five of the six counts in Xerox's lawsuit, saying, in essence, that Xerox's complaints were inappropriate for a variety of legal reasons.   Xerox sued Apple in December, seeking more than $150 million in damages. It asserted that the screen display of Apple's Macintosh computer unlawfully used copyrighted technology that Xerox had developed and incorporated in a computer called the Star, which was introduced in 1981, three years before the Macintosh.   ""We welcome the ruling in every way,"" said a jubilant Jack E. Brown of Brown & Bain, the law firm representing Apple, which had filed a motion to have the case dismissed. Even if Xerox prevails on the one count it can still pursue, it cannot win much because the judge threw out all the counts seeking damages, attorneys involved in the case said.   A Xerox spokesman said the company planned to appeal. ""The ruling does not mean Apple hasn't taken substantial portions of the Star and claimed them as their own,"" a statement issued by Xerox said. ""The court merely held, we believe erroneously, that Xerox does not have standing to present facts in support of our contention.""   The Xerox lawsuit is one of many copyright suits that are splitting the computer software industry. A major issue is the right to the screen displays known as graphical user interfaces - a dashboard of sorts by which a user controls the computer.   A key appeal of the Macintosh is its ease of use, thanks in part to a display that allows users to perform tasks by pointing at symbols on the screen and to divide the screen into separate ""windows,"" each containing a different document or program. Now, virtually all computer companies are adopting similar screen displays.   No one disputes that many of the ideas behind such interfaces were born at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970's, although the Star was not a marketing success. But the question of how similar one interface has to be to another to constitute copyright infringement remains unanswered."
