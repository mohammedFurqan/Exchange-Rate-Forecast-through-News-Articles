But today, as bubble-era books like ''Dow 36,000'' collect dust on library shelves, evidence is mounting that there may be a new economy after all.

From 1996 through 1999, it grew at a blistering annual rate of 2.5 percent, compared with 1.4 percent from 1972 to 1995. Economists generally believed that the higher rate was a byproduct of the new economy. Much of the growth was spurred by the highly productive businesses that made information technology products -- companies like Dell, Intel and Microsoft -- and by their customers, who spent heavily to deploy productivity-enhancing PC's and software.

Much of it was driven by the time of year, as corporate chiefs and government officials scrambled to tidy up things before the new year.    A MOGUL IS BORN -- Ending a succession story that was never much of a mystery, Time Warner named Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the head of its movie and television businesses, as its president and chief operating officer. The promotion makes him heir apparent to the chairman and chief executive, Richard D. Parsons.     Mr. Bewkes, 53, was one of two lieutenants to Mr. Parsons, 57. The other, Don Logan, 61, who heads Time Warner's publishing, cable and online properties, will retire at the end of the year and become nonexecutive chairman of the company's cable business.     Mr. Bewkes is perhaps best known for his time at HBO, where he made his mark -- and HBO's reputation -- with hit programs like ''The Sopranos'' and ''Sex and the City.''     In an interview, Mr. Bewkes said he did not anticipate any immediate executive changes. That may be because he will be busy fending off a campaign by the financier Carl C. Icahn to make major changes at the company to raise its stock price.    LUNCH TAB -- A California jury ordered Wal-Mart Stores to pay $172 million in damages for failing to provide meal breaks to nearly 116,000 hourly workers as required under state law. The suit, filed on behalf of employees of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in California, argued that the chain violated state law more than eight million times.     California law requires that employers provide a meal break of 30 minutes for every five hours on the clock. If the break is shorter than that, provided late or not at all, the employer must pay an hour's pay.     Wal-Mart, which faces similar cases in about 40 other states, said it planned to appeal.    LATEST INDICTMENT  -- Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications, the dominant local phone company in 14 Western states, was indicted for selling more than $100 million worth of stock in his company in 2001 after learning that it would miss its financial goals but before making that news public.     In a separate action in March, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Nacchio and other former executives, accusing them of overstating $3 billion in revenue from 1999 to 2002. It said the inflated figures helped Mr. Nacchio earn $216 million in pay and bonuses. In court, he pleaded not guilty.     Several other former Qwest executives have already pleaded guilty and cooperated with government investigators. Qwest agreed last month to pay $400 million to investors hurt by the false financial statements. It also agreed to pay $250 million in fines to the S.E.C. last year.     Prosecutors and the defense team are scheduled to meet on Jan. 20 in federal court in Denver, where Qwest is based, to set a timetable for the trial.    PULLING THE PLUG -- Burdened with debts used to build power plants and with long-term contracts obligating it to sell electricity below the cost of making it, Calpine, a symbol of market deregulation, filed for bankruptcy protection.     Calpine was hurt by the California energy crisis, which sent prices soaring after the company locked itself into long-term contracts, and by the collapse of Enron, which provided much of the liquidity in electricity-trading markets.      Calpine, which employs 3,300 people, has $2 billion of debtor-in-possession financing, which is enough to keep its plants operating for now. But creditors are maneuvering to seize its assets, which include one of the world's largest geothermal plants, in Northern California.    POWER GRAB -- In one of the largest takeovers in the electricity industry, the FPL Group agreed to buy Constellation Energy for $11 billion, creating a company that will own the nation's largest portfolio of electricity generation assets, with more than 45,000 megawatts of capacity.     The combined company will have revenue of about $27 billion and will be the third-largest provider of nuclear-fueled electricity and one of the largest operators of coal-fired power plants.     More mergers are likely after February, when the federal government repeals legislation that prevents conglomerates from using power monopolies to overcharge customers and subsidize other businesses.    A DEAL, SORT OF -- Trade ministers from around the world agreed to stop subsidizing agricultural exports by 2013 and took steps to make it easier for the poorest nations to sell goods to industrialized nations. But the talks, held in Hong Kong under the guidance of the World Trade Organization, did little to persuade rich countries to lower import tariffs or limit subsidies to their own farmers and ranchers.     The agreement helps negotiators as they try to finish a comprehensive set of trade rules by the end of 2007, in time for President Bush to submit it to Congress before a Congressional deadline expires.    GAME OVER? -- Electronic Arts, the largest independent game publisher, and Activision, a big competitor, said holiday sales of their computer and video games were unexpectedly weak. NPD, a market research company, said domestic game sales fell 18 percent last month, to $700 million, from November a year ago.     Paradoxically, a big reason for the slowdown may be the success of the Microsoft Xbox 360 console. Because Microsoft did not make enough to satisfy demand, consumers waiting to buy an Xbox 360 may have stopped buying games for other consoles, like the original Xbox and the Sony PlayStation 2.     The slump may be reversed next year, when more Xbox 360's are in the hands of consumers and after Sony, the leading console maker, and Nintendo release new versions of their hardware.

Mr. Fox has drawn criticism from all three major presidential candidates for his inability to spur faster growth.

His statement came as his company reported a $284 million loss in the third quarter, its first quarterly loss since the final three months of 2003. The company said it lost $1.49 billion, before taxes, in its North American automotive operations. [Page C1.]    The United Auto Workers announced the details of its tentative agreement with General Motors and said that for the first time, G.M.'s union retirees will have to pay deductibles, monthly premiums and co-payments.

The bill now goes to President Bush, who has promised to sign it. [A1.]    Medical Publication Questions a Diabetes Drug  An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association said the proposed diabetes pill Pargluva seems to significantly increase risks of heart attacks and strokes, and an accompanying editorial said the drug's sponsors, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, had submitted misleading data to the Food and Drug Administration that ''may have fostered an illusion of safety.'' [C7.]    Roche has agreed to meet with four generic drug companies to discuss allowing them to manufacture the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu, which is in short supply as countries stockpile it to prepare for a possible flu pandemic. [C7.]    Facing increasing generic competition and concerns about the heart risks of Celebrex, its once-popular painkiller, Pfizer said its third-quarter profit fell 50 percent, to $1.6 billion, and its sales fell 5 percent from the year earlier period. Profit for the current quarter will fall far short of analysts' forecasts, the company said and its shares fell 8 percent.

And interest in such programming may grow further: last week, Apple introduced a video iPod, which, while not a cellphone, is another test of consumers' interest in portable entertainment. So far, efforts by media companies are modest, limited largely to games, ring tones and wallpaper.

Mr. Cook, left, who took over day-to-day operations during chief executive Steven P. Jobs' recovery from cancer surgery last year, will essentially become the No.2 person at Apple. ''Tim has been doing this job for over two years now, and it's high time we officially recognized it with this promotion,'' Mr. Jobs said in a statement. Mr. Cook, 44, will continue to overseeing worldwide operations and leading the Macintosh division, and will work with Mr. Jobs and the executive team to lead Apple's overall business, Apple said. The company also said Jon Rubinstein, head of the iPod unit, will retire March 31 and be succeeded by Tony Fadell, vice president for iPod engineering.   (AP)    Pension Agency Objects to Airline's Reorganization Plan  The government agency that insures corporate pensions has objected to United Airlines' reorganization plan, saying in court documents that the carrier has changed a deal covering the termination of its pensions. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation said in a filing that the airline's disclosure statement, which details its financial model, is ''unconfirmable.'' United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, must get bankruptcy court approval of the statement before asking creditors to vote on restructuring. The agency complained that the plan was inconsistent with a settlement the parties reached last spring for the airline to turn its pensions over to the government.   (Reuters)    Medical Device Maker Posts a Quarterly Loss  Boston Scientific said yesterday that it had lost ground to its only medical device rival in the lucrative market for drug-coated heart stents, reporting a $269 million third-quarter loss and slowing sales of a stent that provided big profits last year. The performance, hurt by a $598 million expense for a legal settlement, fell short of company's projection and Wall Street's expectations. Boston Scientific executives said in a conference call with analysts that its Taxus stent has lost market share to the Cypher stent made by Johnson & Johnson's Cordis Corporation. The company, based in Natick, Mass., said it lost 33 cents a share and the results compared with a profit of $258 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2 percent, to $1.51 billion.

The approval of the Delaware banking commissioner, Robert Glen, was required because MBNA is based in Wilmington, Del. Bank of America is based in Charlotte, N.C.   (AP)    Justice Department Approves Software Merger  Adobe Systems said late Thursday that the Justice Department had approved its $3.4 billion acquisition of Macromedia. Adobe and Macromedia, two of the largest providers of graphic design software, must wait for several European jurisdictions to approve the deal before it can close. Adobe's Illustrator and Macromedia's Freehand are two of the leading products for vector graphics illustration, a term for drawings that are stored as collections of points and objects instead of pixels. A combined company would also own a substantial part of the market for Web site-building tools.   (AP)    Profit Rises 21 Percent at Insurer UnitedHealth  The UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest health insurance companies, reported a 21 percent increase in third-quarter profit on membership gains and lower-than-expected medical costs. The company forecast profit growth would continue through 2006 at an annual rate of at least 15 percent. UnitedHealth predicted a Medicare prescription drug benefit would add 2 million to 3 million members to its rolls next year, potentially increasing 2006 earnings by 5 cents a share. UnitedHealth said it expected to complete its acquisition of PacifiCare Health by year-end or early in 2006. UnitedHealth said its third-quarter profit rose to $842 million, or 64 cents a share, from $698 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 percent, to $11.3 billion.

A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Mr. Bush and Mr. Martin spoke by telephone for about 20 minutes, and trade was a major part of their discussion. Mr. Martin criticized the United States government last week for its position on trade in lumber, saying Washington was ignoring a North American Free Trade Agreement ruling against United States duties on Canadian softwood lumber.

The company also cut its full-year forecast, saying it expects 2005 earnings of $3.85 to $4 a share, down from its previous estimate of $4 to $4.20 a share. Caterpillar said it lowered earnings expectations because of a higher tax rate and about $100 million in expected pretax expenses for changes in its dealer distribution software and a product realignment under consideration.

The program is run by private companies under federal supervision, and passengers pay a fee to be prescreened to get a biometric encoded identification card, which uses fingerprints and iris scans. Right now, the only operating program is called Clear, run at the airport in Orlando, Fla., by Verified Identity Pass of New York. Yesterday, the Saflink Corporation, a security company based in Bellevue, Wash., said it had expanded a partnership that now includes Microsoft to compete in the Registered Traveler program. Other partners include Johnson Controls., Expedia Corporate Travel and ID Technology Partners. The Transportation Security Administration has said a wide rollout of the program beyond Orlando would begin next year at airports nationally. At Orlando, more than 11,000 frequent fliers have already signed up for Clear, which costs $79.95 a year, the company's founder, Steven Brill, said. Saflink, in announcing yesterday that it had expanded its partnership, said its competing card could also be used as a credit card.    A COURTYARD FOR MOSCOW -- The first Courtyard by Marriott hotel in Russia is scheduled to open this week with rooms ''offering spectacular views of the Kremlin,'' Marriott International says. The opening of the 218-room hotel will expand to 100,000 the number of guest rooms within Courtyard, Marriott's main moderately priced brand, which operates 700 hotels in the United States and abroad. Introductory rates at the Moscow Courtyard will start at $225 plus tax, the company said.    FOR BETTER ONLINE BOOKING -- More than 80 percent of small-business travelers book trips directly on airline Web sites, but they are not especially impressed with the sites' flexibility, a new survey by the American Small Business Travelers Alliance, a nonprofit organization based in Flower Mound, Tex., finds. ''The Internet has done much to level the playing field for small-business travelers,'' Chet Gray, the vice president of the group, said in a statement. Small businesses, including the self-employed, do not typically have access to in-house booking systems used by big companies to arrange travel. While the survey shows small-business travelers are avidly booking online directly with airlines, ''opportunities remain for more tailored services on these sites,'' Mr. Gray said.    ONE THICK MAGAZINE -- A new in-flight magazine, US Airways Magazine, with its first issue in January weighing in at a fat 200-plus pages, is being published by Pace Communications, which also puts out United Airlines' Hemispheres and Delta Air Lines' Sky magazines. US Airways Magazine, with a monthly printing of 375,000 copies, will replace America West Magazine and US Airways' Attaché magazine, and will be available on all flights flown by the merged carriers and their regional partners.    LEARN FRENCH WHILE YOU FLY  -- Travelers on Singapore Airlines can now take interactive language-learning lessons in 20 different languages on the airlines' in-flight on-demand entertainment system. That doubles the number of language offerings available since the program began in June, the airline said. The programs are produced by Berlitz World Traveler. In all, Singapore's in-flight entertainment system, which it calls KrisWorld, has more than 500 on-demand video and audio options, including 60 movies.

Ms. Wright, who had been with Ford since 1988 in high-level engineering roles, was involved in Ford's hybrid and fuel-efficiency initiatives. She also helped conduct the company's recent hybrid clinics with consumers, where she trumpeted Ford's commitment to hybrids and improved vehicle fuel efficiency. Ms. Wright will be succeeded by Nancy Gioia, who previously oversaw engineering of small vehicles, including the Mustang.   (Dow Jones/AP)    Judge Refuses to Become Involved in Google Case  A federal judge has rebuffed an attempt by Google Inc. to remove court-ordered restrictions limiting its employment of the computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee, whose recent defection from Microsoft exposed tensions between the companies. In a ruling late Thursday, Federal District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose, Calif., declined to become involved in the legal battle over Mr. Lee until the completion of a Washington State trial on the validity of a noncompete agreement Mr. Lee signed when he joined Microsoft in 2000. The Washington trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 9.   (AP)    Profits Decline at Archer Daniels Midland  Shares of the Archer Daniels Midland Company rose yesterday despite a 30 percent decline in first-quarter earnings from sluggish grain sales because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Much of the profit decline was attributed to the agricultural services unit, which was disrupted by the storms. The largest business segments, including corn and oilseed processing, showed solid profit growth. Net income was $186.3 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with $266.3 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 33 cents a share. Sales dropped 4 percent, to $8.63 billion, below analysts' estimates of $9.08 billion.   (AP)    No Accord, F.C.C. to Meet Again on 2 Takeover Deals  Federal regulators failed to reach agreement yesterday on whether to approve the takeover of AT&T by SBC Communications and the purchase of MCI by Verizon Communications. The Federal Communications Commission met through the day but could not agree on what conditions, if any, should be attached to the deals. Another meeting was set for Monday. The negotiations come a day after the Justice Department gave its blessing to the acquisitions, with limited conditions.   (AP)    AirTran Decides Not to Sell Tickets on Expedia  AirTran Holdings Inc., parent of AirTran Airways, said yesterday that it would no longer make its inventory and fares available for sale with Expedia Inc., which runs the online travel agency Expedia.com. The low-cost carrier also said it had entered a multiyear deal with the Cendant Corporation to sell tickets through its Apollo and Galileo travel sites.   (Reuters)    S.E.C.

Mr. Ricciardi, 52, who is head of the S.E.C.'s Boston office, will manage and track the workload. They will replace succeed Thomsen, who was named director in May.   (Bloomberg News)    Profit Soars 46% at Deutsche Bank  Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, said yesterday that third-quarter profit increased 46 percent after a surge in trading revenue and the highest fees from underwriting and giving mergers advice in almost three years.

(Bloomberg News)    Matsushita Electric Reports Higher Income on Strong Sales  The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the Japanese maker of Panasonic electronics, said yesterday that its profit surged 33 percent for the July-September quarter, lifted by strong sales of flat-panel TVs, digital cameras and personal computers.

I use Outlook Express for e-mail. Does that window at the bottom that shows the selected message make me more vulnerable to computer viruses?    A. Outlook Express has had its share of security problems over the years, and there have been malicious threats that take advantage of its preview pane, which displays the contents of a message without your having to open the file. Internet security experts have often recommended turning off the preview pane to prevent such instant virus and worm infections when you go through your e-mail.     You can turn off the preview pane by going to the Views menu in Outlook Express, selecting the Layout option and unchecking the box next to ''Show preview pane.''  "

Peter M. Flanigan, investment banker and aide to my former boss, Richard M. Nixon, and ambassador to Spain. Roy L. Ash, a co-founder of Litton Industries and a budget director in the Nixon and Ford administrations. Mr. Nixon, president and peacemaker. Paul W. McCracken, genius economist and adviser to three presidents. C. Lowell Harriss, a super teacher and emeritus professor of economics at Columbia University. Anna Jacobson Schwartz, a renowned economist and statistician. And the list goes on and on.      But at the top of the totem pole for their contributions to man's progress and to human understanding comes Milton Friedman, and his wife, Rose D. Friedman. This week, a giant fête is being held in their honor (nominally about his 90th birthday, although he actually turned 93 in July) in Los Angeles. I was to be the master of ceremonies, but I was also needed to preach the good gospel of freedom and gratitude at the University of Utah that night, so I think I will tell a little bit about this giant of a man right now.

Among the recommendations were hiring more part-time workers and discouraging unhealthy people from working at Wal-Mart. [Page C1.]    McDonald's to Add Nutrition Labels  McDonald's announced that it would begin putting nutrition labels on most of its food products starting next year. [C1.]    Family Withdraws Bid to Take Cablevision Private  The Charles Dolan family withdrew its bid to take the Cablevision Systems Corporation private and asked directors to approve a $3 billion dividend to shareholders. The family issued a statement saying that it ''has become clear that we will be unable to reach an agreement'' with directors. [C1.]    German Industrial Workers Face a New Reality  Just as the American auto industry and its workers are facing stark choices between reducing costs and preserving a social compact that has long provided generous wages and benefits, Germans are confronting the grim arithmetic of the global economy: most industrial workers here are paid far too much to compete with those in Eastern Europe and Asia. [C1.]    DaimlerChrysler reported that its third-quarter profit dropped by more than one-fifth even as business steadily improved at both its Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz divisions. It attributed its weakened performance to increased income tax expenses. [C7.]    Survey Indicates Confidence in German Economy  The German economy, which has taken one step back for every two steps forward since the recession of 2003, may finally be on firm footing, according to a new survey. The Ifo survey of business confidence rose 2.7 points in October, to 98.7, its highest level in five years. But the emergence of Angela Merkel, the conservative leader, left, as the designated chancellor of a ''grand coalition'' government seems to have soothed the uncertainties of German business people. [C10.]    An Unknown Becomes a Safe Choice for Fed  Ben S. Bernanke, President Bush's choice to succeed Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman, has a world-class reputation among economists, credibility on Wall Street, and an air of political independence that seems free from hints of cronyism.

[C6.]    Amazon Earnings Fell in the Third Quarter  Amazon.com said its profit declined during the third quarter, partly as a result of a legal settlement, while sales of the latest Harry Potter book helped increase revenue by 27 percent. [C4.]    BellSouth Profit Rises Despite Hurricane Impact  The BellSouth Corporation said that profit rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter, though Hurricane Katrina pushed sales lower. BellSouth earned $817 million, or 44 cents a share, in the quarter as more customers signed up for high-speed data lines. Including its 40 percent share of Cingular Wireless and without some one-time items, BellSouth earned 46 cents a share, in line with estimates.

Ultrasone, a German headphone manufacturer, is entering the American consumer market with its iCans headsets for iPods, MP3 players and other portable sound devices. Ultrasone says that the headsets, which are priced at about $130, reduce the pressure on the eardrum by as much as 40 percent compared with earbuds.

But those amenities -- parks, plazas or atriums, for example -- sometimes fail to live up to expectation, fall into disrepair and are occasionally scrapped altogether.      It was recently disclosed, for example, that the Forest City Ratner Companies will not open a rooftop park to the public -- as it originally announced -- as part of its proposed mixed-use development on Atlantic Avenue in downtown Brooklyn, which includes an arena for the New Jersey Nets basketball team, as well as 16 buildings. The omission of the park is a small change amid many others in this large-scale development, but it provided fodder for critics and renewed questions about relying on private developers to create public spaces.

[C1.]    Rule Change Would Allow Foreign Investment in Airlines  The Bush administration is proposing to allow foreign airlines and other foreign investors to control the management of airlines based in the United States, a move intended to attract capital to hard-pressed carriers. Jeff Shane, a Transportation Department official, said the proposed change could have a profound impact on the airline business, both here and abroad, by lowering barriers to global investment. [C11.]    Novartis Would Consider Building a U.S. Vaccine Plant  The chief executive of the Swiss drug company Novartis, Dr. Daniel L. Vasella, left, said the company would consider building a vaccine production plant in the United States amid concern that its deal for the Chiron Corporation would leave the United States overly reliant on foreign companies for flu vaccine supplies. Novartis won approval this week from independent directors of Chiron, the only major United States producer of flu vaccines, to buy the 58 percent of the company that it does not already own for $5.1 billion.

[C11.]    Deutsche Telekom to Cut 19,000 German Jobs  Deutsche Telekom, the largest phone company in Europe, said it would cut 19,000 jobs from its German payroll over the next three years as it struggles to cope with changes in the telecommunications sector. [C4.]    Nortel Reports a Smaller Loss as Internet Sales Rise  Nortel Networks said that it narrowed its third-quarter loss to $105 million, from $259 million, helped by higher sales of Internet-related products. [C5.]    Mercury Interactive Executives Resign in Options Inquiry  The chief executive and two other top executives of the Mercury Interactive Corporation resigned amid a widening investigation into the pricing of employee stock options. In a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mercury, a large provider of software for monitoring Web sites, said an internal investigation found at least 49 instances in which the stated date of a Mercury stock option grant was different from the date on which the option appears to have actually been granted.

You've resigned from your job, and the human resources department has requested an exit interview. How do you make sure that your last impression is a good one?    A. Much like an initial job interview, the exit interview requires employees to act with dignity, said Maggie Craddock, president of Workplace Relationships, an executive coaching firm in New York City. ''As tempting as it might be to blow it off, the exit interview is not a time to go in and say, 'I'm out of here,' '' Ms. Craddock said. ''How you leave often is what sticks with people about you after you've gone, so it's critical to handle the exit interview professionally.''    Q. What purpose do exit interviews serve?    A. They aren't mandatory, but it's generally a good idea to participate if asked. For employees, the meetings can provide closure for their tenure at a company. For employers, they can help unearth facts about the workplace environment. Beth Carvin, chief executive of Nobscot, a human resources software company in Honolulu, says the best companies use this information to improve the workplace for those who remain.  "

The debate over whether it should do so rages on. The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, left, has invoked the specter of rising inflation as the main reason to lift rates from 2 percent -- a level, he notes, that is historically low. Inflation in Europe is running at roughly 2.3 percent, above the bank's threshold of 2 percent. Some economists, however, forecast that it will fall back below 2 percent by next summer. [Page C1.]    European stocks paced declines by stocks worldwide after a measure of German business confidence fell more than economists had predicted. DaimlerChrysler and Siemens were among the shares that fell. [C5.]    W.T.O. Chief Not Counting on a Consensus  Pascal Lamy, the new director general of the World Trade Organization, does not even plan to propose a comprehensive agreement before trade ministers from 149 nations and customs territories gather in Hong Kong on Dec. 13. Instead, Mr. Lamy intends to issue a fairly broad outline of where the different sides stand on a range of issues, said Keith Rockwell, the chief W.T.O. spokesman. ''He's not going to try to force a consensus that's not there,'' Mr. Rockwell said. [C1.]    An Ambitious Plan for a Chinese City  The extensive chemical spill in the Songhua River that threatens the water supply of Harbin in northeastern China has focused attention on the environmental and economic challenges faced by the country's withering rust belt. Long before Harbin's officials were forced to confront the contamination of the city's water supply, however, they had embarked on a radical step, one increasingly common among cities in China: they had begun efforts to move the center of the city north, across the winding Songhua, to a large plot of farm land. [C1.]    New Orleans Bank Continues Its Struggle  Nearly three months after Hurricane Katrina, reconstruction of the New Orleans economy is turning out to be slower and more complex than many people first thought, as businesses like Liberty Bank and Trust are discovering. Basic services like electricity, water and sewerage are still lacking in large swaths of the city, including the New Orleans East neighborhood, home to four of Liberty's eight New Orleans branches. [C1.]    At Lehman, a Different Kind of Risk Management  In preparing for the unlikely but frightening possibility of a bird flu pandemic, Lehman Brothers is focusing on two issues: how to enable people to work from home -- which requires resolving connectivity and technology issues -- and, as an industry, how to connect companies to one another to prevent a financial panic.

In terms of games themselves, this year has not measured up to last year.     Some brilliant games have emerged, like Resident Evil 4, God of War and Jade Empire, but these have been interspersed with others that have not reached above pretty darn good. Still, some amazing games have turned up.    NINTENDOGS       For a while I thought Nintendo's double-screened DS hand-held device was destined to be a cute, pointless gimmick. I was proved wrong this summer. Game designers showed that the DS touch screen could heighten the game experience with such titles as Advance Wars: Dual Strike; Trace Memory; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney; and, most notably, the puppy simulator Nintendogs. When I first heard of a game in which you raise dogs I thought it sounded dumb, but as those puppies squirmed happily as I petted the touch screen and sat when I shouted ''sit'' into the DS microphone, I was proved wrong once again. Easily the most adorable game of the year.     (Developed and published by Nintendo for Nintendo DS; $30; for all ages.)    GUILD WARS  An increasing number of multiplayer online role-playing games now exist in which a player wanders the countryside battling monsters, running errands and looking for better weapons and more powerful spells. And while I was almost as impressed with this year's City of Villains, it lost out in my heart to the deeper game play of Guild Wars. With an engaging battle system, gorgeous graphics and far more effective storytelling than is found in any other persistent-world game, Wars has become my all-time favorite in its class. It is also the perfect game for budget-conscious gamers; unlike the vast majority of such games, there is no monthly fee. If you are Donald Trump, saving $15 a month may not mean much, but I find it irresistible.     (Developed by ArenaNet and published by NCsoft for Windows 98/ME/2000/XP; $40; ages 13 and up.)    BURNOUT LEGENDS       The PlayStation Portable is the first hand-held console to nail racing games, and no game displays this better than Burnout Legends. The series' high-speed, crash-happy races are more exciting than anything else on the virtual road, so it is no surprise that Burnout Revenge is the best racing game of the year for the Xbox and PlayStation 2. What is amazing is that Legends brings the same intense, manic energy to something that fits in your pocket.      (Developed by Criterion and published by Electronic Arts; $50; for ages 10 and up.)    PHOENIX WRIGHT: ACE ATTORNEY       The most outrageous episodes of ''Ally McBeal'' exhibited a more faithful portrayal of the legal system than Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney does. In Phoenix Wright, perjury is treated as mildly inappropriate, and witnesses receive great leeway if they hand the judge a box lunch. But if this detective-adventure game gets every point of law wrong, it does get every aspect of game play right, with intelligent puzzles and wildly funny dialogue threaded through interrelated stories filled with improbable plot twists. It is fortunate that the game, my favorite of the year, comes with its own lawyer: anything this fun is bound to be illegal.     (Developed and published by Capcom for Nintendo DS; $30; for ages 13 and up.)    F.E.A.R.       A perfect combination of spooky chills and frenetic thrills, F.E.A.R. is everything you want in a first-person shooter, unless, that is, you want a plot that holds together. While the narrative is weak, the game moves the player assuredly through challenging firefights punctuated by ghostly scares. With a first-rate online multiplayer mode, F.E.A.R. is the most necessary shooter of the year. It's also a game that demands the most from your computer; you can buy it for $40, but if you want to play F.E.A.R. at maximum detail level, budget an extra $1,500 for a new computer.     (Developed by Monolith Productions and published by Vivendi Universal Games for Windows 2000/XP; $60 (DVD) or $40 (CD); for ages 17 and up.)    THE MOVIES       The Movies is two games bundled together. One is a terrific tycoon game where you take on the role of a Hollywood mogul, keeping your actors happy and producing award-winning films. The other is a moviemaking game that lets you create cinema scene by scene and upload the results to movies.lionhead.com. My favorite game-based movie so far is ''Scholastic Films: Intelligent Design,'' which hilariously outlines the evils of empirical reasoning. The game part of The Movies is about building a powerhouse studio, but for aspiring filmmakers the game is about something else entirely: getting your film listed as the most popular on the game's Web site.      (Developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Activision for Windows 98/ME/2000/XP; $60 (DVD) or $50 (CD); for ages 13 and up.)    GUITAR HERO       Guitar Hero may or may not be the greatest music game ever, but it is certainly the coolest. While Dance Dance Revolution has people frenetically stamping the floor, and Karaoke Revolution Party emulates the wacky joy of real karaoke, Guitar Hero has the player churning out grinding, wailing, crunchy guitar riffs. Sure, all you are really doing is pushing buttons on a plastic guitar peripheral, but play the game for a half-hour and you'll be so convinced you're Jimi Hendrix that when you go outside you'll wonder where your groupies went.     (Developed by Harmonix and published by RedOctane for PlayStation 2; $70 including guitar controller; for ages 13 and up.)    FIRE EMBLEM: THE SACRED STONES       The folks at Intelligent Systems have had a great year churning out extraordinary turn-based strategy games. Besides the standout Nintendo DS game Advance Wars: Dual Strike, they created two first-rate games in the Fire Emblem series, one for GameCube and one for Game Boy Advance. The strategy role-playing game Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is the best Game Boy Advance title of the year. Soldiers' strengths and weaknesses are balanced beautifully. By throwing out the role-playing tradition that allows you to resuscitate fallen warriors, the game makes your every decision feel as if it's a matter of life and death. Intelligent Systems understands perfectly the nature of hand-held games: they are designed so you can stop playing at a moment's notice, but so compelling that you hate to do so.     (Developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo; $30; for all ages.)    BROTHERS IN ARMS: ROAD TO HILL 30       First-person shooters make battles immersive and chaotic; strategy games make the same battles cerebral exercises in planning. Some games try to do both, like the interesting Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders, but no game has done this quite as elegantly as Road to Hill 30. This game lets you crawl across the battlefield and fire on the enemy, but you can also zoom to a bird's-eye view of the battlefield, letting you map a strategy, which often involves having the rest of your squad pin down the enemy with gunfire while you sneak behind them. It's still to a great degree an intellectual exercise, but one with a visceral punch.     (Developed by Gearbox Software and published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Windows 2000/XP; sequel is $50, but the original has been marked down; for ages 17 and up.)    RESIDENT EVIL 4       Not many games can terrify players for an entire year, but the horror survival game Resident Evil 4 frightened GameCube owners in January and did the same for PlayStation 2 owners in October. The game is a radical departure from the series, retaining the creepy atmosphere but replacing shuffling zombies with spry, homicidal villagers and racing the player through wonderfully varied game play. Changes can be scary, but these turned out so well that they are the only thing in the game that won't give you a fright.     (Developed and published by Capcom; $40; for ages 17 and up.)"

And so, the video iPod. And with it, Mr. Jobs's particularly clever coup: sealing a deal with his quasi-estranged partner, the Walt Disney Company, to distribute downloaded versions of such hit Disney-produced shows as ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost'' on the new gizmo, at $1.99 each. It's not exactly 500 channels of entertainment, but it's a good anchor tenant, supplemented by pay-per-download music videos and other clever features, such as films from Mr. Jobs' other outpost, the animation studio Pixar.

The host of the gathering, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, right, hopes progress can be made in balancing Britain's proposal to scale back farm subsidies that benefit countries like France with French and German demands for a reduction in Britain's annual budget rebate.    DOWN TO THE WIRE -- Europe's protectionist agricultural policy -- not just its $50 billion in subsidies to farmers but also its high tariffs on imports -- is creating quite a trans-Atlantic row. The United States says Europe's refusal to bend is threatening the future of world trade talks, scheduled to resume in Hong Kong in December. Developing countries want both the United States and Europe to open their markets wider, and Washington is proposing steeper reductions in subsidies and tariffs than capitals like Paris are prepared to accept. The European Community is expected to come up with a revised offer later this week.    HIGH-TECH TRAVEL -- Starting Wednesday, all passports issued by the 27 countries participating in the United States Visa Waiver Program, which allows business travelers and tourists to enter the country for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, must display a digital photo of the holder. Passports produced before then are still valid, however.    FEAR VERSUS GREED -- For investors spooked by both inflation fears and the prospect of a housing market correction, clarification on whether to buy or sell is on the way. Figures for last month's sales of existing homes are due out tomorrow and for new homes on Thursday, while the latest store sales, plus two consumer-confidence indexes, will be reported tomorrow. Durable-goods orders for September will be reported on Thursday. Third-quarter gross domestic product numbers come out Friday.    SLOWING DOWN -- Earnings reports will ease a little from last week's pace; many companies will report results but fewer big names are among them. Here are the highlights: Today, American Express, Merck, Texas Instruments; tomorrow, BellSouth, DuPont, International Paper, Northrop Grumman, U.S. Steel; Wednesday, Boeing, ConocoPhillips, Lucent; Thursday, Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, Verizon.    WISDOM FROM ON HIGH -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is speaking a couple of times this week, in Kansas City on Wednesday, after receiving the Harry S. Truman Medal for Economic Policy, and in Houston on Thursday after a ceremony for the new Federal Reserve branch building."

The European Commission, the union's regulatory arm, said that government grants to help consumers buy or rent digital decoders in 2004 and 2005 may have given an unfair advantage to RAI and to Mediaset, owned by Mr. Berlusconi. Mediaset and RAI dominate Italy's television market. Both run three free-to-air channels, controlling about 90 percent of the market for TV advertising and viewers. ''The subsidy seems to help free-to-air operators enter the pay-TV market,'' said Europe's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, above. Sky Italia, a pay-TV satellite broadcaster, had complained about being ineligible for the aid. The investigation, likely to last a year or more, could result in Italy being forced to recover the money from the two million consumers who benefited."

The company, which is based in Cincinnati, said it expected to complete the acquisition today and would start shedding the Gillette brands in the October-December quarter. (AP)    Fuel Costs Prompt Flight Cuts at American Airlines  American Airlines, the nation's largest passenger air carrier, said yesterday that it was temporarily canceling 15 round trips in markets it serves from its two largest hubs, Chicago O'Hare and Dallas-Fort Worth, because of the high cost of jet fuel. The cutbacks will begin Wednesday and continue through Oct. 29, when American said it would evaluate the jet fuel market and decide whether to restore the flights. (AP)    Sara Lee in Talks to Sell European Apparel Unit  The Sara Lee Corporation said yesterday that it was in talks with a private equity firm, Sun Capital Partners Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., on the sale of its European branded apparel business, probably at a price less than it anticipated. Sara Lee said it was taking an additional write-down, likely to be $165 million, on the value of the business, which includes Dim, Playtex, Wonderbra and Abanderado. The sale will not include its Courtaulds business, which makes private-label apparel for retailers. Sara Lee is selling its European apparel business to focus on deli meats, baked goods, Senseo coffee and household products. (Reuters)    Hilfiger Restates Results After Checking Taxes and Leases  The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation said yesterday that preliminary results showed fiscal year 2005 earnings below its previous estimate, and that it was restating earnings for the prior four years as a result of accounting issues. The company, which recently hired an investment bank to explore options including a possible sale, said net income for the year ended March 31 was about $86 million, or 93 cents a share, on a preliminary basis. Preliminary pretax income for the year was about $89 million, below its previously reported estimate of $92 million. The company, which designs and sells Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld clothing, said the restatement related to tax matters, lease accounting and other adjustments. (Reuters)    French Court Awards Former Adidas Owner $163 million  An appeals court in Paris ordered the French government and the formerly state-owned bank Crédit Lyonnais yesterday to pay 135 million euros ($163 million) in compensation over the 1994 sale of the sportswear maker Adidas. Crédit Lyonnais, since privatized and acquired by a rival bank, Crédit Agricole, and the CDR government agency set up to take over its bad debts, were ordered to pay the compensation to Bernard Tapie, above, Adidas's former owner. Mr. Tapie, who bought Adidas in 1990, sued Crédit Lyonnais and the government for 990 million euros ($1.2 billion) over the 1994 sale of the sportswear brand, now part of Adidas Salomon. (AP)    New Directors Named at Brasil Telecom  A new board was named yesterday at Brasil Telecom, allowing Citigroup and a group of Brazilian state-run pension funds to take control of the company after months of legal battles. The shake-up was a blow to Daniel Dantas, a Brazilian financier who essentially controlled Brasil Telecom since it was privatized in 1998. Mr. Dantas, who owns a private equity fund called the Opportunity Group, handpicked the management team dismissed yesterday. Citigroup and the pension funds, Brasil Telecom's majority shareholders, have been fighting for months to wrest control of the company from Mr. Dantas, who oversaw Citigroup's private equity investments in Brazil until he was fired in March.

Stock in IMS, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., fell 3 percent, and stock in VNU, which is based in Haarlem, the Netherlands, rose more than 4 percent. (Reuters)"

Bennett, pleaded not guilty yesterday to eight counts of conspiracy, fraud and other charges related to an accounting scandal that drove the futures brokerage company into bankruptcy. Mr. Bennett, 57, left, is accused of hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in bad debts from Refco investors as the company went public in August. Refco, based in New York, was the largest independent futures and commodities brokerage in the nation before the scandal prompted customers to abandon the firm, forcing it to file for bankruptcy last month. No trial date was set but Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of United States District Court in Manhattan set another hearing for Jan. 18. Mr. Bennett, a British citizen, was indicted on Nov. 10 on eight charges related to the accounting scandal. He was released on a $50 million bond but confined to his penthouse on Park Avenue and monitored electronically. (Reuters)    Arraignment for Conrad Black Set for Tuesday  An arraignment for Conrad M.

Lord Black, 61, was charged Thursday with siphoning millions of dollars out of the company through bogus fees and abuses of perquisites. His arraignment was set for 9 a.m. Tuesday before Judge Amy St. Eve of Federal District Court in Chicago. The United States attorney in Chicago, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, said that an arrest warrant had been issued for Lord Black, but that he would be allowed to turn himself in voluntarily. Mr. Fitzgerald said extradition proceedings would be started if Lord Black, a former Canadian citizen, did not come in voluntarily. (AP)    S.E.C. Sues Former Texas Oil Executive in Fraud Case  The Securities and Exchange Commission has sued the former chief financial officer of Patterson-UTI Energy, claiming he embezzled $69 million from the company, which operates of a fleet of land-based oil and gas drilling rigs. The former executive, Jonathan D. Nelson, 36, was accused in the lawsuit of using a bogus invoice scheme over five years to send money to companies he controlled. He then spent the money on an airplane, an airfield, a cattle ranch, homes, vehicles and a truck stop, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in federal court in Lubbock, Tex. Judge Sam R. Cummings of Federal District Court in Lubbock froze Mr. Nelson's assets and those of five companies he controlled on Wednesday. A hearing was set for Dec. 2. Telephone calls to Mr. Nelson were not returned. (Bloomberg News)    SBC Completes $16 Billion Acquisition of AT&T  SBC Communications said that it had closed its $16 billion purchase of AT&T after California regulators approved the deal, removing the last hurdle. The transaction, which creates a communications company with about $90 billion in annual revenue, was approved by antitrust and telecommunications regulators last month. The new company will be known as AT&T Inc. California regulators also approved Verizon Communications' purchase of MCI yesterday. That deal is expected to close next month or early 2006. (Reuters)    Alltel Buys Midwest Wireless to Expand Its Network  The Alltel Corporation, the rural telephone operator based in Little Rock, Ark., said yesterday that it would buy Midwest Wireless Holdings for $1.07 billion to expand its wireless telephone network. The deal, which gives Alltel 400,000 customers in markets next to its existing operations, comes after its $4.5 billion purchase of Western Wireless earlier this year. The privately held Midwest Wireless operates in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin. Alltel's shares rose 32 cents yesterday, to $64.62. (Reuters)    G.M. Resolves Dispute With Chinese Automaker  The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had reached a settlement resolving all legal disputes with the Chinese automaker Chery Automobile Company, which had been accused of pirating the design of G.M.'s Spark minicar. G.M. had said the Spark appeared similar to the Chery QQ, and filed lawsuits trying to prevent Chery from selling the car in various markets, including Asia and Eastern Europe. G.M. had also threatened legal action because it said the name Chery sounded too much like Chevy, the nickname of its Chevrolet brand. Chery agreed in September that it would not market its vehicles under the Chery name in the United States. G.M. and Chery also said they would not take any further legal action against each other. Further details of the settlement were not released. (AP)    AnnTaylor Doubles Profit in Third Quarter  The women's clothing retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corporation said yesterday that third-quarter profit more than doubled, the biggest gain in three years, after it sold more pants and sweaters at full price and cut marketing costs. Third-quarter net income climbed to $30.4 million, or 42 cents a share, from $13.9 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period ended Oct. 29 climbed 12 percent, to $514 million, AnnTaylor said. An improved fashion assortment at the Ann Taylor chain, including dresses in black and ivory, helped limit discounts. AnnTaylor is renovating stores, trimming inventory and adding apparel in neutral colors to increase comparable-store sales, which rose in two of the past three months after nine consecutive declines. Comparable-store sales at the Ann Taylor division rose 3.7 percent, compared with a 4.2 percent drop last year. (Bloomberg News)    Sanyo Forecasts Another Loss and Plans Share Sale  The Sanyo Electric Company, the Japanese electronics maker, forecast a second year of record losses yesterday and said that it would raise as much as 300 billion yen ($2.5 billion) by selling shares. Sanyo said its loss for the year ended March 31 would swell to 233 billion yen, from 171.5 billion yen a year ago. The company, which is based in Osaka, is paring its sprawling operations after competition with Chinese manufacturers eroded earnings, causing a 39 percent slump in its shares in the past two years. Sanyo said it may spin off its semiconductor unit. (Bloomberg News)"

Mack is stepping up efforts to add businesses and possibly bolster his management team. Yesterday, Morgan Stanley severed ties with three former executives who were forced to leave the firm by Philip J. Purcell during his management shake-up earlier this year. While making such a break with executives whom some had hoped might return, Mr. Mack has stepped up his search to acquire a hedge fund. Within the last month, he offered to buy FrontPoint Partners, a hedge fund manager with more than $5 billion in assets, according to people who were briefed on the discussions.

More sellers are putting their homes on the market, houses are selling less quickly and prices are no longer increasing as rapidly as they were in the spring, according to local data and interviews with brokers.     In Manhattan, the average sales price fell almost 13 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, according to a widely followed report to be released today by Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, and Prudential Douglas Elliman, a real estate firm. [Page A1.]    Home builders have never had it so good. Builders are reporting blistering earnings and their shares are trading at or near record highs. And many builders are beginning to cash in. [C1.]    Energy Department Begins Campaign to Reduce Fuel Use  The Energy Department announced a campaign to persuade Americans to use less energy, a response to record prices for natural gas and heating oil as cooler weather arrives. The energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, said that new supplies were still essential but that they were a long-term solution. To react to the damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Mr. Bodman said, only conservation would offer any immediate help. [A21.]    High-Speed Internet at 35,000 Feet, but Not in America  Boeing's Connexion unit, which sells high-speed Internet access on the aircraft that Boeing builds, has sold its service to airlines in Europe, Asia and the Middle East but airlines in the United States, citing cost concerns, have not bought into it. [C1.]    Security lines, weather delays and equipment failures make flying a burden for many. For Jason Green, it is a slice of heaven, virtually the only place he is not bombarded by phone calls and e-mail messages. But federal regulators are reassessing the rules barring phones in the air. [C1.]    S.U.V. Sales Take a Big Drop in September  Sales of large sport utility vehicles were down 43 percent in September, according to a new report, dealing a blow to General Motors and Ford Motor, which have been increasing their reliance on truck-based S.U.V.'s. Last month, G.M. saw its overall sales fall 24.2 percent and Ford's sales decline 20.3 percent. In contrast, sales at Toyota rose 10.3 percent, Honda increased 11.7 percent and Nissan 16.4 percent. [C1.]    Only Thing Missing From Microsoft 's Xbox 360 Is Games  In the five months since Microsoft unveiled the Xbox 360, the company has tried to generate excitement by staging demonstrations of the console's ability to play music and display digital photographs and by trumpeting its online community features. But something is missing: the games. [C1.]    New Insurance Plan for Part-Time Workers  Dozens of part-time workers at six large companies have begun to sign up for low-cost, limited health benefits in a national program for uninsured employees. [C2.]    US Airways Repurchases Stake From a Federal Agency  US Airways said it would pay $115.8 million to buy stock warrants that had given the federal government a sizeable stake in America West, which merged with US Airways last week. [C2.]    Stocks Mixed Amid Concerns About Inflation  Stocks were mixed after a report showed that the nation's manufacturing sector was expanding but costs were rising. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 33.22 points, to 10,535.48. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 2.11, at 1,226.70, and the Nasdaq gained 3.74, to 2,155.43. [C11.]    A $3.3 Million Merger of Real Estate Companies  Brandywine Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust based in suburban Philadelphia, said it had reached an agreement to acquire Prentiss Properties Trust of Dallas in a cash, stock and debt-assumption deal that the companies said was worth about $3.3 billion. Both companies specialize in the development, ownership and management primarily of office buildings. [C4.]    Manufacturers Expanded Last Month, but Costs Climbed  The nation's manufacturing sector shook off the impact of Hurricane Katrina and robustly expanded during September, but prices for raw materials surged, raising the prospect of higher inflation and interest rates. [C4.]    Egg Producers Alter Labels Over Care Implications  The label ''Animal Care Certified'' on egg cartons was supposed to assure egg buyers that hens were getting enough food, water and cage space to flap their wings. But after complaints by an animal welfare group that the labels were misleading consumers into thinking that hens were receiving indisputably humane care, the Federal Trade Commission approved a labeling change last week.

Who Carries a Big Stick,"L'AFFAIRE Cyberonics began a week ago Tuesday. That evening, Cyberonics, a small Houston-based medical device maker, held an invitation-only educational program for psychiatrists. The company was in the process of introducing its new product, an implantable device for people who suffer from treatment-resistant depression. It was using the event, held simultaneously in 48 cities, to recruit psychiatrists to the cause.     Just about everything about the new device, called the VNS Therapy System, is steeped in controversy. (VNS stands for vagus nerve stimulator.) The data about its effectiveness is muddy. The Food and Drug Administration initially declined to approve it for commercial use, then changed its mind and signed off on it in July. It is expensive -- about $15,000 -- and nobody knows whether health insurers will be willing to reimburse depression patients who want to try it. Or whether psychiatrists will support it. For Cyberonics, which has only one other product on the market (a similar device for epilepsy sufferers), it is a huge roll of the dice. If the VNS Therapy System fails in the marketplace, it will be a disaster for the company -- and its stock price.  "

The Commerce Department reported that the deficit in the current account totaled $195.8 billion in the third quarter. That was down 1 percent from the deficit of $197.8 billion in the April-to-June quarter. The third-quarter figure was below the $205 billion imbalance that had been forecast. Analysts said payments by foreign insurance companies to settle damage claims stemming from hurricanes helped to narrow the gap. Analysts are predicting that the current-account deficit for 2005 will set a record, exceeding $800 billion, and that it will rise above $900 billion next year. (AP)    President to Leave Philadelphia Federal Reserve  The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Anthony M. Santomero, announced that he planned to step down early next year, leaving a third vacancy at the top of the central bank. Mr. Santomero's resignation occurs as Ben S. Bernanke, whom the White House has nominated to be the next Fed chairman, prepares to succeed Alan Greenspan early next year. Mr. Santomero was a voting member this year on the committee that sets interest rates. Next year, the Philadelphia Fed president will not be a voting member of the committee, under the rotating system that gives the 12 regional Fed presidents a vote every second or third year. A search committee of the Philadelphia bank will choose Mr. Santomero's successor, and the Bush administration must still nominate two people for open spots on the Fed's seven-member board of governors. (REUTERS)    Johnson & Johnson to Buy Maker of Insulin Pumps  Shares of the Animas Corporation, a maker of insulin pumps, soared after Johnson & Johnson said that it had agreed to acquire the company for about $518 million to capitalize on the growing demand for diabetes treatment. Once the acquisition closes, Animas, based in West Chester, Pa., will operate as a stand-alone entity under LifeScan, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary that sells blood glucose monitoring systems. Animas shares rose $5.83, or 32 percent, to $24.03. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is expected to close in next year's first quarter, pending approval from antitrust regulators and Animas shareholders. (AP)    Adobe Shares Soar as Profit Forecast Exceeds Estimates  Shares of Adobe Systems, a maker of graphic design software, surged 11 percent, the most in three years, after the company's profit forecast exceeded analysts' estimates. Adobe said its fiscal 2006 profit, minus some costs, would be $1.26 to $1.30 a share. Adobe reported $510 million in fourth-quarter sales, also topping analysts' estimates. Profit for the quarter gained 38 percent on demand for new versions of its Photoshop and Illustrator programs. Adobe completed the $3.4 billion acquisition of Macromedia this month. The purchase gives Adobe Web design programs and Macromedia's Flash, video software that is used in 98 percent of personal computers. Adobe shares rose $3.89, to $38.82. The stock has advanced 24 percent this year.
