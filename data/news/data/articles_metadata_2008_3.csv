The cable guys were outraged because the Big Ten wanted a dollar per subscriber per month — nearly triple the price commanded by, say, CNN or the USA Network — and was further demanding a primo spot on extended basic, which is where everybody who starts a network wants to be. For their part, the cable companies wanted to relegate the Big Ten Network to a sports tier, where the fans who watched the games would also be the ones who pay for them. For the record, while I do not believe in a la carte cable pricing, I do think that sports should be treated as an exception: sports channels are so expensive — ESPN alone is some $3 a month a subscriber — that it is the single biggest reason your cable bill is so high. Putting sports channels on a sports tier makes sense, it seems to me."
