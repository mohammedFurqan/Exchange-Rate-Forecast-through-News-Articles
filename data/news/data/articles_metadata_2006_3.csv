The Tigers want the withdrawal of all monitors called for in a 2002 truce who come from countries in the European Union, which added the group to its list of banned terrorist organizations in May. Sweden’s move would bring the Nordic-supervised monitoring mission to a third of its original 57-member size. Last week, Finland and Denmark said they were withdrawing.

Judge Colin Campbell of Ontario Superior Court issued an interim order approving the company’s plan after a hearing in Toronto, Inco’s chief legal officer, Simon Fish, said. The sale to Phelps Dodge, based in Phoenix, can be scuttled if enough stockholders tender their shares to Teck by Aug. 16. Teck, which already owns about 4.5 percent of Inco, needs two-thirds of the shares to move ahead with the takeover. Inco, which is based in Toronto, supports Phelps’s bid, although the company said it would be willing to consider Teck’s proposal if it were improved. Teck’s chief executive, Donald Lindsay, said Tuesday that a higher bid was “unlikely.”."

Nauru, a tiny and desolate island with only basic facilities even for residents, is the most likely place for future asylum seekers. In a rare move in a government with strong party discipline, three members of the Liberal Party joined the opposition Labor Party to vote against the bill. The measure, proposed by Prime Minister John Howard, above, who has taken a tough stance on asylum seekers, is widely seen as a concession to Indonesia, which reacted strongly earlier this year when Australia granted asylum to 43 refugees from Papua Province. The bill must still be approved by the Senate, where the Liberals have a slim majority."

The charges, filed late Thursday by Judge Miluska Cano, connect Mr. Humala to allegations of an abduction and murder of a married couple and the torture of a man, actions reported to have taken place in 1992 around a jungle military base in the north. Mr. Humala, who retired from the army as a lieutenant colonel before his presidential bid, acknowledges that he was based out of the area at that time. His lawyer called the charges “an abuse of the law against my client.” Judge Cano ordered Mr. Humala to remain in Peru."

But the Free Aceh Movement, which fought for independence for nearly three decades and signed the peace accord last year, said the new law fell short of its demands, and of the provisions in the accord. “The authority for the government in Aceh is not clear — it says in the bill that the law in Aceh has to follow Indonesian law,” said Bakhtiar Abdullah, above, a spokesman for the movement. “If everything has to be in with the Indonesian standard, where’s the new law?” A key to the settlement, negotiated between the sides by Martti Ahtisaari, a former president of Finland, was an understanding by the rebels that a new provincial government in Aceh would have far wider authority than in the past. The passage of the law, four months later than stipulated in the peace accord, paves the way for elections later in the year."

A competitor, Unisys, said it hoped to open programs soon at airports in Denver and Reno, Nev. Clear costs $79.95 a year; the T.S.A. fee will be added to that.

Luce, Time magazine spoke in a single authoritative voice that reflected the world back to its readers. Now Richard Stengel, the new managing editor of Time, wants to change the metaphor. His plan is to fill the pages of Time with more essays and news analysis, give the magazine a sharper point of view and draw more brand-name journalists into the fold. If this sounds familiar, it may be that Mr. Stengel wants Time to be a little more like its chief rival, Newsweek. [Page C1.]    A WIKI WAVE -- Although Wikipedia is operated by a nonprofit foundation, ideas for advertising-based wiki sites are beginning to take their place alongside blogs and social networking sites as a staple of Silicon Valley business plans. [C1.]    GIRLS AS GAMERS -- The Frag Dolls, a group of stylish, fresh-faced girls, are one of the latest weapons in the gaming industry's effort to smash the stereotypical image of the gamer as a geeky teenage boy battling aliens. The French computer game giant Ubisoft is backing teams of girl game players while the girls help Ubisoft promote computer play. Other companies are also intensifying efforts to tap the feminine side of computers in a $29 billion industry that is trying to cope with declining sales as consumers await the arrival of a new generation of consoles. [C2.]    A REVIVAL OF SORTS -- Vonage went public in May at $17 and bottomed out at $6.30 in July, but since then the stock has stabilized and climbed slightly. It closed on Friday at $8.90. Today, the company plans to announce that it has attained 2 million subscribers, up from 1.6 million at the end of the first quarter. [C1.]    A MESSAGE IN LEBANON -- A billboard for Johnnie Walker whiskey stretches across the side of a multistory building north of Beruit and shows a drawing of a bridge with a chunk missing. In an allusion to the Israeli air strikes, the Johnnie Walker character, cane in hand, strides away from the gap and across the bridge on the poster, which urges the Lebanese to ''keep walking.'' The ad is notable because multinational companies usually go out of their way to insulate their marketing from any reference to sensitive international disputes. [C4.]    ASSESSING A PRODUCT -- Scores of Internet merchants have begun following Amazon's lead by posting customer reviews -- both flattering and flaming -- of products they sell, and directing shoppers to sources of the most highly rated items. At Petco, for example, the Web division has tested the service of a new technology that essentially polls retail customers. According to John Lazarchic, Petco's vice president for e-commerce, left, 30 days after the company placed links near products asking visitors to write reviews, more than 1,000 products attracted comments. Bob Tedeschi, E-Commerce Report [C5.]    BLOG SITE SHUTDOWN -- Lee Siegel, a senior editor for The New Republic and the author of the Lee Siegel on Culture blog, was suspended indefinitely from the magazine after a reader accused him of using a ''sock puppet,'' or Internet alias, to attack his critics in the comments section of his own blog. An editor's apology replaced the blog on the Web site. [C4.]    TAKING ON ITUNES -- So far, none of the companies that sell music online have emerged as serious competitors to Apple iTunes. But not one has an audience like MySpace, which announced plans to begin selling songs. For the industry, which worries about Apple's online dominance, a MySpace music store could present a difficult decision. News Analysis. [C3.]    THE LIFE OF CONRAD BLACK -- According to a Canadian newspaper report, a recent court order stipulates that Conrad M. Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, can each spend up to $25,000 a month on ''reasonable'' expenses, which must be approved by the court. For Lord Black, that is budget living. In a financial disclosure, Lord Black said his monthly expenses ran more in the range of $200,000, and that was after selling his homes in London and New York. The asset freeze is yet another major obstacle for the former press tycoon, who is at the center of a web of corporate scandal and is preparing to defend himself against criminal fraud and racketeering charges.

And the timing could not be worse for him: barely a week before Brazil's 126 million voters cast their ballots in a presidential election.     The focus of the new scandal is a dossier that officials in Mr. da Silva's party and campaign had hoped would incriminate his opponent in the 2002 election, former Minister of Health José Serra, in an overbilling scheme involving the sale of ambulances. Mr. Serra is now a candidate for governor of São Paulo, the country's most populous state, and is running far ahead of one of Mr. da Silva's allies.  "

ALLIANCE France is ''extremely cautious'' about the prospect of General Motors forming an alliance with Renault and Nissan, the French industry minister said yesterday. ''This shouldn't be taken as a done deal; it's an idea,'' François Loos, the minister, below, said in an interview with i-Tele television. Mr. Loos was speaking after the boards of Renault and Nissan on Monday authorized Carlos Ghosn, who is chief executive of both carmakers, to begin negotiations with G.M. if its board agrees. The French state holds about 15 percent of Renault. A alliance among Renault, Nissan and G.M. would nevertheless be ''positive'' in principle, Mr. Loos added. (AP)    G.M.'S SALES IN CHINA SOAR General Motors said yesterday that its sales in China jumped 47 percent over a year earlier in the first six months of this year, helped by stronger-than-expected demand. G.M. and its joint ventures sold 453,832 vehicles in China in the January to June period, compared with 308,722 in the same period of 2005, the company said in a statement. G.M. says it had a 12.5 percent share in the China vehicle market, up from 10.8 percent a year earlier, making it the No. 1 foreign automaker in the country. Last year, it surpassed the longtime leader, Volkswagen of Germany. On Monday, G.M. reported a 26 percent decline in its United States sales for June over the previous year.

''If negotiation can prevent that, so be it.'' Yahoo China officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Yahoo China is a partnership between the Internet giant Yahoo Inc., which owns 40 percent of the business, and Alibaba.com of China.

The company said in May that a computer with names and Social Security numbers of 30,000 current or retired Union Pacific employees had been stolen from a personnel employee on April 29. The lawsuit was filed Friday in Pottawattamie County, Iowa, by the nine railroad employees on behalf of a class that could include 30,000 members, according to the lawsuit. A Union Pacific spokesman said Monday that company lawyers had not yet seen the lawsuit and had no comment. (AP)    RUSSIA WARNED ON ENERGY The ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned Russia yesterday of the dangers of basing its economy on the energy industry, urging policy makers to avoid ''the pitfalls of hydrocarbon dependence.'' The company said in a report that an influx of foreign currency from the sale of Russian gas and oil could force up the value of the ruble, which could harm other industrial sectors. The report said that receipts from oil and gas provided Russia with about 50 percent of its government revenues, and 65 percent of export earnings.

TODAY'S TOP STORIES    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  The ""Civil G8"" forum opened in Moscow Monday ahead of the Group of Eight summit. Nearly 600 non-governmental organizations, half of which are internationally based, are set to discuss questions of global civil society. Ella A. Pamfilova, the presidential civil society and human rights advisor, called the summit unique in that such a forum has ""not taken place anywhere before.""      The participants will likewise have the opportunity to pass along recommendations to President Vladimir V. Putin when he visits the forum today. Also convening in Moscow next week is an opposition conference led by Gary Kasparov's United Civil Front in cooperation with Andrei N. Illarionov, former presidential advisor and head of a the Institute for Economic Analysis. ""A Different Russia"" intends to heavily criticize what it contends are the current administration's human rights violations. Sergei A. Markov, member of the Public Chamber, said comparing ""Civil G8"" to ""A Different Russia"" is like comparing ""a Mercedes and a wooden horse."" The Putin Administration has discouraged Group of Eight member states from taking part in the opposition conference.    IZVESTIA  COMRADE, HAVE FAITH!: Monday saw the opening of the Worldwide Summit of Religious Leaders in Moscow. Over 400 delegates from 40 countries met to discuss ways to protect and defend moral and spiritual ideals in the secular world. President Vladimir V. Putin opened the summit with calls not to ""drive a wedge"" between Christian and Islamic civilization while issuing a warning to extremists who ""cynically use believers' feelings"" to further their cause. The summit was notable for the absence of both Pope Benedict XVI and the Dalai Lama. The Russian Orthodox Church explained that where a visit by the pope must take place under more notable circumstances, a visit by the Dalai Lama to Russia would ""complicate the situation"" with China. Izvestia cites likely areas of unity between the leaders to be on questions regarding human rights, the spread of religious knowledge, and denunciation of ""perversion, debauchery, and violence"" in the media.    VEDOMOSTI  PATRIOTS FOR A THIRD TERM: An obscure group called ""Patriots of Petersburg"" began collecting signatures for those in favor of a third term for Vladimir V. Putin. This initiative followed an interview of Valentina Matvenko, governor of St. Petersburg, by ""Moskovskie Novosti"" on Friday where she stated her support for allowing Mr. Putin to run for a third term for the sake of ""continued stability."" This is not, however, the first of such movements. Earlier third term initiatives were put forth by regional legislatures in the Magadan and Ivanovski regions. Experts attribute the flurry of third term supporters to anxiety on the part of the regional elite. This stems from Vladislav Y. Surkov's recent statement that ""when new people come to power, the management of such companies will change."" They therefore want Mr. Putin to remain head of Russia's blooming state corporation. Aleksey Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies, though, does not see these initiatives sanctioned from above; if that were the case, he says, ""authorities from culture and the intelligentsia"" would head the agitation campaign. Vedomosti was not able to contact the Petersburg patriots for comment.    KOMMERSANT  DEPUTIES SEEK LOOSER SECURITIES LAWS: United Russia deputies seek to make changes to the law governing the Federal Security Service that would allow the president to send FSB special forces abroad to fight terrorism without the permission of Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federal Council. The changes would allow the president to use special forces troops ""against terrorists and/or their bases located outside the territory of the Russian Federation for the elimination of threats to national security."" The proposed changes are expected to be signed into law and ready for implementation within the next two weeks. While some United Russia deputies want to spell out the criteria for the law's implementation, Kommersant notes that most of the party ""will not bother to pay attention to such trivial matters.""    VREMYA NOVOSTEI  MILITARY SALES FALL UNDER CIVILIAN CONTROL: The military industrial commission held its meeting Monday announcing plans to create a federal agency responsible for the sale of military technology abroad. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Sergei B. Ivanov announced the agency's creation along with a number of other reforms to the military-industrial complex. The civilian agency will represent not only the interests of the Ministry of Defense in foreign sales, but all other state security agencies as well. In addition to the creation of this new agency, the committee discussed new inspection regulations regarding production of military technology and updated the list of sensitive technologies which are deemed essential to national security. These two reforms are being implemented parallel to the state program outlining Russia's military armament plan from 2007-2012.  "

In the five-year plan, Wal-Mart will push its 600,000 global suppliers to find more efficient packaging methods. It estimates total supplier savings of $11 billion.     Wal-Mart said it would start working with suppliers in November to prepare for the changes. Last October, the company's chief executive, H.

Last week's news that the Consumer Price Index had risen 0.2 percent in August, down from 0.4 percent in July, looked to some economists like validation that inflation was slowing, a trend that would not tempt the Fed to raise rates. But the Producer Price Index for August also comes out this week, helping to inform any decision (Tuesday). Other reports this week will include the second-quarter current-account deficit (Monday), August housing starts (Tuesday) and leading economic indicators (Thursday).    STORM CLOUD WARNING -- Directors of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will meet in Singapore to discuss, among other things, economic imbalances brought about by the United States' trade deficit with China (through Wednesday). The managing director of the I.M.F., Rodrigo de Rato, said in a speech this month that there were ''more clouds on the horizon than there were a year ago.'' In its semiannual World Economic Outlook last week, the I.M.F. said that the cooling housing market in the United States would probably slow domestic economic growth and suggested that further interest rate increases might be a good idea.    STRONG WORDS FOR CHINA -- Days after delivering a tough warning to China about its economic policies, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the United States Treasury secretary, visits Beijing this week, his first trip there since taking office this summer. Last week Mr. Paulson spoke out against China's policy of keeping its currency, the yuan, at an artificially low value in relation to the dollar, a policy that has led to record trade surpluses for China. He said that China's currency exchange rate was increasingly being viewed by its critics ''as a symbol of unfair competition.''    REPORTING, QUARTERLY -- This week will bring a trickle of big-company earnings reports. They include CKE Restaurants, the Oracle Corporation and Progress Software (Tuesday); Bed Bath & Beyond, CarMax, Circuit City and Morgan Stanley (Wednesday); 3Com, A. G. Edwards, the Carnival Corporation, ConAgra, FedEx, General Mills, Nike, Palm, Rite Aid and Scholastic (Thursday); and KB Home (Friday)."

In addition, large or long-standing organizations are having a difficult time securing all the required information, like names and private addresses of founding members with whom the organization may not even be associated any more.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  THE BATTLE FOR BOMBAY: General Jaswant Singh of India arrives in Russia this week to discuss military-technological cooperation. Questions over quality have made India consider other options besides Russias MiG-35 for their upcoming $6.5 billion fighter plane contract. Currently, 80 percent of Indias military hardware is Russian-made. Russias MiG-35 is likely to encounter fiercest competition from American made F-16 and F/A-18 fighter planes. This visit, therefore, is likely to be Russias best opportunity to win back Indias favor.    VEDOMOSTI  MINISTRIES RANKED BY BUDGETARY SHARE: In preparation for the 2007 federal budget, Russias Ministry of Finance has included rankings of federal ministries by their future share of budgetary resources. Releasing such information prior to publication of the official budget is unprecedented. The Ministry of Finance tops the list of budgetary share, followed by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. Officials explain the rankings as part of a new result-oriented program evaluating the efficiency of Russias federal ministries.    RUSSIAN OLIGARCH TO ENTER FILM INDUSTRY: Viktor Vekselberg, Russian billionaire industrialist, is planning to finance an historical film called 1612, a period known as the Time of Troubles. His holding company, Renova Media will invest about $4 million in the film. Mr. Vekselberg is the latest Russian oligarch to finance Russias film industry. Where in 2005, 70 percent of the film industry was financed by the state, in 2006 50 to 60 percent is financed by the private business sector.    VREMYA NOVOSTEI  RAMZAN KADYROV PREPARES FOR THE CHECHEN PRESIDENCY: Ramzan A. Kadyrov, prime minister of Chechnya, looks to be in the running for the Chechen presidency. The leader of Chechnyas lower house, Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov, said it is the peoples wish for Mr. Kadyrov to become president. Experts say Mr. Abdurakhmanov often expresses thoughts or ideas that may be too sensitive for higher officials to say publicly. This is therefore seen as a possible prelude to Mr. Kadyrovs run for the Russian republics top post.    KOMMERSANT  ALUMINUM MONOPOLY ON THE HORIZON: The leaders of Russias two major aluminum companies have agreed to consolidate their assets, establishing the largest aluminum company in the world. By merging their companies, Viktor Vekselburg of SUAL and Russian Aluminums Oleg Deripaska will control 100 percent of Russias aluminum market. A clause in Russias antimonopoly law allows for the creation of monopolies that will strengthen Russias position in the global market. The merger, which is planned for mid-October, will create a company worth an estimated $22 billion according to company insiders.    ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA  The leader of Russias main power company, Anatoly Chubais, met with President Vladimir V. Putin in Sochi on Saturday to discuss the energy deficits plaguing dozens of Russias regions. According to Mr. Chubais, solving Russias energy problems will require heavy investment, not just by the government, which does not have the resources to provide the estimated 2.1 trillion rubles needed for the next four years, but by private investors. Mr. Chubais proposed that responsibility for energy production be handed over to private companies, leaving the government with control over distribution and delivery.    IZVESTIA  A funeral will be held today in Omsk for a journalist, his wife and their two young sons who were shot by a 16-year-old local resident on their vacation in Altai on Aug. 8. As explanation for his crime, the teenager, Ruslan Kulish, said he had wanted, if only for one day, to live like a person. After he murdered the family, Kulish stole their 1991 Mitsubishi and about $700. Afterwards he spent the money with his friends, who knew about the crime, but did not inform the authorities.    NOVYE IZVESTIA  In September, the Association of Russian Farmers and Agricultural collectives plans to hold nationwide protests against unrestrained price increases for petroleum. According to organizers, farmers are unable to afford fuel even at current prices, and will not be able to hold out through the harvest season. Government authorities, according to the newspaper, have come up with an innovative way to deal with the problem. They recommend that officials refrain from giving any prognosis on future petroleum prices, so as to avoid public unease.  "

CHIEF AND SPY CRISIS -- Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, has had to apologize for his inaction related to the spying scandal there. But he has also won the benefit of the doubt within the company and among investors because he has done so well turning the company around. [Page C1.]    SPOTLIGHT ON CNET -- Dawn Kawamoto, below, a 10-year veteran of News.com, a technology industry news site produced by CNet Networks, is the author of a story that ran in January revealing strategic changes under consideration at Hewlett-Packard. From that point forward, Patricia C. Dunn, who was the company's chairwoman until she resigned last week, embarked on an ambitious quest to learn the source of information leaked to Ms. Kawamoto. The effort has thrown a spotlight on Ms. Kawamoto and on CNet Networks, which has been described as the home page for Silicon Valley. [C4.]    COMPANIES AND SURVEILLANCE -- Hewlett-Packard is far from alone in diving into the world of private investigators and secret surveillance. Despite concerns about the legality of such actions, security experts say there are plenty of reasons that companies need to be involved in the spy game, or at least bolster their intelligence-gathering apparatus. [C1.]    NOT SO FUNNY IN HOLLYWOOD -- For the last few years, a tight network of stars, agents and managers has dominated comedy in Hollywood. But that is changing as relationship are fraying and as studios crack down on the prices they are willing to pay for top performers and reduce the overall number of films they release. [C1.]    PARALLEL MEDIA VENTURES -- The founders of Digg, a Web site where users submit links to news accounts around the Internet, are working on expanding Revision3, an Internet video production firm. Revision3's most successful offering so far is a show called ''Diggnation,'' where two hosts talk about some of the most popular stories on Digg.com that week. [C1.]    COMICS ONLINE -- Platinum Studios, a relative newcomer in the comics industry, plans to begin publishing its books online before they go to press for traditional distribution through stores and newsstands. [C8.]    DONATION DRIVE -- Recognizing that procrastination is an enemy of good intentions, a new public service effort, to be announced today, aims to persuade Americans to actually act upon their altruistic impulses. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C7.]    NEW MTV CHANNEL -- Today, MTV is introducing MTV Tr3s as a replacement for the all-Spanish language ''MTV en Español,'' a 15-year-old video jukebox. The new channel will not shun Spanish, but it will mostly reflect a fusion of American and Latin music, cultures and languages, MTV executives said. [E1.]    HEADBUTT, BY NIKE -- When Zinédine Zidane, the French soccer star, leveled an Italian defender, Marco Materazzi, with a blow to the chest during the World Cup final in July, the incident nearly overshadowed Italy's victory over France. Now, in celebrating their soccer superiority, some Italians, and their sponsor, Nike, are taking a few jabs at the French in a new advertising campaign. [C7.]    FAIR-TRADE CLOTHING VENTURE -- An online store called Fair Indigo will rely mostly on the Web and catalogs to sell what executives say is the first mainstream clothing line made in accordance with fair-trade practices. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C4.]    INTERNET ANTECEDENTS -- As Fred Turner points out in his new book, ''From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism,'' the romantic, utopian culture of the 1960's, with its deep suspicions about modernity and machinery, is closely linked to the recent Internet revolution.

But perhaps the most unusual is Pet Butler, a service that collects dog waste and disposes of it properly for a fee.     The company, based in Dallas, began selling franchises last year, and has 17 nationwide. Matt Boswell, the founder, said there was no shortage of office workers willing to trade briefcases for pooper scoopers. Each month he receives more than 200 applications from people willing to pay the $24,900 franchise fee. New franchise partners can expect to pay a total of about $60,000 in start-up costs.  "

[C1.]    NEW CHALLENGE FOR SCRIPPS -- The stock price of Scripps -- once an old-line newspaper company -- has outperformed that of its peers largely because of growth in its cable network unit. But the media landscape has continued to change rapidly, and now cable networks are, like newspapers, under new competitive pressure as well, from the Web. The question for Scripps, as with many other media companies, is whether it can continue to adapt -- and do so quickly enough. [C1.]    VERIZON REWIRING -- In New York, Verizon is taking the laborious and expensive step of building a new state-of-the-art network in an effort to fend off rivals like Comcast and Vonage, which are moving rapidly into the phone business. [C1.]    NEW WAYS TO SHOP ON WEB -- Two new shopping services, Mpire.com and Slide.com, present variations on the traditional method of finding items online. Mpire allows shoppers to view the most recent selling prices of millions of items from sources like eBay and Craigslist. ''I want to show consumers what prices they should actually be paying,'' said Matthew Hulett, Mpire's chief executive, above. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C6.]    ROLE OF IMAGES IN CONFLICT -- Although doctored and stage-managed photographs out of Lebanon garnered their share of headlines last week, they are just a part of a larger, underlying issue: the role of images in fairly portraying the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. [C1.]    DIGITAL DETECTIVE WORK -- The recent discovery that a Lebanese photographer had manipulated pictures he took for Reuters raised several questions about the standards of photo-journalism in the age of widespread digital photography. The incident also increased the pressure on news photo editors, who edit and publish thousands of photographs under deadline each day, to catch digital alterations. [C4.]    SEEING THE END AS NEAR -- When Israel and Hezbollah began trading blows last month, the community at RaptureReady.com, a fundamentalist Christian site dedicated to the proposition that the end times are near, was atwitter, taking the conflict as another sign of an impending judgment day. Tom Zeller Jr.: Link by Link. [C3.]    NEW ERA OF READER-REPORTERS -- The German tabloid Bild has joined a growing number of European publications that are taking advantage of cellphone technology to reach new levels of reader interactivity and, some say, invasion of privacy. [C5.]    MARKETING ACROSS AMERICA -- When an advertising columnist left Madison Avenue -- and the rest of New York City -- behind for a 16-state road trip, he discovered new trends. Among them were large Starbucks stores turning up at service plazas along places like the Ohio Turnpike, joining fast-food mainstays like Burger King and McDonald's. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C5.]    KIT FOR GAME DESIGNERS -- Microsoft is expected to announce the fall release of a product called XNA Game Studio Express, a basic version of the company's game authoring tools that will let aspiring designers write games on a PC and test them on an ordinary Xbox 360.
