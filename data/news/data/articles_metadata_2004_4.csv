The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that allowing Canadian drug imports would have a negligible effect on costs. And drug makers say they would simply reduce their shipments to distributors in the countries supplying the drugs. [Page A1.]    No Deal on Russia-China Pipeline  Russia and China failed to seal an agreement on a proposed gas pipeline from eastern Siberia to northern China. President Vladimir V. Putin, left, of Russia visited China this week amid hopes that a deal was near. Instead, the two countries signed a loose agreement that left the door open to future talks. Many said the two countries remain wary neighbors. [C3.]    Layoffs and Write-Down at Sprint  Sprint plans to lay off 700 sales representatives and write down the value of its network to reflect the eroding market for traditional phone services. The company has already eliminated 7,500 positions this year. [C2.]    Delta Expects a Large Loss  Delta Air Lines said that it expected to lose as much as $675 million for the third quarter, renewing speculation that it could seek bankruptcy protection later this month. [C12.]    Greenspan Eases Fears on Oil  Alan Greenspan said higher oil costs had hurt the gross domestic product this year, but he said the long-term outlook for global oil supplies was reassuring. Crude oil prices climbed 17 cents, to $54.93 a barrel. [C4.]    British Bankers Face Extradition  A judge ruled that three British bankers can be extradited to the United States to face charges of wire fraud related to off-balance-sheet dealings with Enron. [C3.]    Retail Sales Surged in September  A large increase in September retail sales and gains in producer prices indicated stronger economic growth. But a surprisingly soft reading on consumer confidence showed that high oil prices were a threat. [C3.]    Economic Reports Lift Stocks  Stocks rebounded as a retail sales report showed that higher oil prices were not keeping consumers from spending. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.91 points, to 1,108.20, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.93 points, to 9,933.38. [C4.]    Judge to Decide Fate of Oracle Bid  The two-week trial to decide the fate of Oracle's $7.7 billion hostile tender offer for PeopleSoft moved to the judge, who said the parties had moved closer together. [C2.]    Warning Labels on Antidepressants  The Food and Drug Administration ordered pharmaceutical companies to add strong warnings to antidepressants, saying the drugs can cause suicidal thoughts and actions in children and teenagers. [A9.]    Inquiry on Bonds at Bear Stearns  Bear Stearns said it had received subpoenas from federal investigators looking into its municipal bond business. [C12.]    Bitumen Price-Fixing Charges  The European Commission plans to file charges against several companies for fixing the price of bitumen, an oil-based product used in making houses and road surfaces. [C3.]    Flu Vaccine Not Salvageable  None of the flu vaccine made by Chiron that was quarantined in Britain is safe for Americans to use, federal health officials said. [A14]  "

Merck said in a securities filing that its board had decided to give its 230 most senior managers the opportunity for a payment of up to three years of salary and bonus if another company buys Merck -- or merely buys more than 20 percent of its shares. [Page A1.]    Another Purchase by UnitedHealth  UnitedHealth said that it would buy Definity Health for $300 million. The acquisition was the latest move in the company's strategy of diversifying away from its signature managed care business. Earlier this year, UnitedHealth acquired Oxford Health Plans and Mid-Atlantic Medical Services. Shares of UnitedHealth are up 42.6 percent so far this year. Market Place.

Gutierrez, who was nominated by President Bush to be commerce secretary. Mr. Jenness has been a Kellogg director since 2000 and serves as head of the board's consumer-marketing committee. He was once a vice chairman and chief operating officer of the Leo Burnett Company. [C4.]    Editor of Le Monde Steps Down  The editor in chief of Le Monde, Edwy Plenel, resigned from the paper, which has been struggling with a downturn in advertising and circulation.

I have some songs that play fine with the iTunes program, but when I look for the song files on my hard drive, I can't find them. How can I find these files?    A. Apple's iTunes for Windows and Macintosh is a versatile music-management program that can do everything from converting songs from CD's to computer-friendly digital audio files to loading up your iPod and printing fancy jewel-case covers for homemade mixes you make for friends and loved ones.    Although iTunes keeps its own default folder to store the audio files you make from CD's or for tracks you purchased from the online iTunes Music Store, the files do not have to be in this folder for iTunes to display or play them. That makes it possible for songs all around your hard drive to be listed in your iTunes database, regardless of whether they reside in the iTunes Music folder.  "

Airlines like United and American still promote the full-service approach to flying, but the airline carrying the most passengers within the United States is Southwest, a discount carrier.     The transformation in the industry is rewarding companies like Southwest and JetBlue that are thinking up new ways to meet their customers' needs with few frills and low fares on popular routes. [Page A1.]    United Airlines will most likely terminate its employee pension plans and replace them with less-expensive retirement benefits, its chief financial officer said in an interview. [C3.]    Delta Air Lines is Atlanta's largest private employer, so the city is watching closely as the airline teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. [C3.]    A High-Tech Merger in France  Sagem, a French maker of electronic equipment, and Snecma, a state-controlled manufacturer of aircraft engines, announced a merger plan that would create a company worth more than $9 billion. Some analysts said the merger was driven by political interests. But Gregoire Olivier, above, Sagem's chief executive, said it made business sense. [C2.]    Questions for Ovitz in Disney Case  Michael S. Ovitz, the former president of Disney, described an aborted attempt to join the Sony Corporation and was grilled about whether Disney board members were informed about his performance. [C4.]    Lehman Settlement in Enron Suit  Lehman Brothers will pay $222.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit contending that it and other brokerage firms and banks helped Enron mislead investors. [C2.]    China's Move Is Taken in Stride  Most Asian financial markets reacted with surprising calm to the Chinese central bank's announcement of its first increase in interest rates in nine years. [C2.]    Japan's central bank said consumer prices would turn slightly higher in 2005, heralding a possible end to a period of deflation. [C2.]    NTT DoCoMo Reports Profit Drop  NTT DoCoMo, Japan's top provider of mobile phone service, said its profit fell 6 percent for the most recent six-month period from a year earlier. Its rivals have moved more quickly to cut prices and offer faster data services. [C2.]    Oil Helps Stocks End Week Higher  Blue-chip stocks ended higher, helped by gains in energy companies. The major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 2.8 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index and the S.&P. 500-stock index each rising 3.1 percent. [C4.]    EBay Is Asked to Police Artifacts  The British Museum has asked eBay to stop the sale of ancient artifacts dug up by Britons who failed to report their discoveries as required by law. [B7.]    U.S. Asks Merck for Added Data  The Food and Drug Administration told Merck that it needed further data before it would approve the drug Arcoxia, a successor to the pain reliever Vioxx. [C3.]    Aon Withdraws Earnings Forecast  Aon's stock fell 5.6 percent after it withdrew its earnings forecast because of slow sales and the loss of contingency commissions, which it halted last week amid an investigation by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. [C12.]    ChevronTexaco Profits Rise 62%  ChevronTexaco said its third-quarter profit rose 62 percent, to $3.2 billion, as a result of rising oil prices. [C4.]  "
