""The one thing that is going to save magazines is writing; it isn't visuals,"" said Mr. Black, a leading art director who has recently been involved in redesigns of Newsweek, Premiere, Esquire, Town & Country and Harper's Bazaar and in the start-ups of Esquire Gentleman, Smart Money and Out."

The review of the Treasury borrowing practices, for better or worse, was driven by the Administration's promise of a budget savings of $16 billion over the five fiscal years 1994 through 1998. The Senate Budget Committee, in preparing its own budget plan earlier this year, came up with a proposal to meet the Administration's savings goal by shifting some longer-term borrowing with higher interest rates to shorter-term borrowing with lower interest rates."

Blaming the ""rich"" for our demise, especially as a ploy for achieving a national mandate, is unfair, counterproductive and demagogic. It should be dismissed for the smokescreen it represents.

But they also are learning something else, something of direct interest to business: Audubon House is showing that eco-consciousness can reduce energy costs and boost worker productivity. We call this bottom-line effect the other green in green design.  Why is this so important? Because commercial buildings are the nation's leading consumers of new energy.

Although the United Nations, several foreign governments and a variety of independent poll monitors have certified the voting as free and fair, diplomats in Phnom Penh warned that the Government was laying the groundwork for a claim that the election results should be annulled and that it might try to hold power even if it lost at the polls."

A surprisingly large jump in the May Producer Price Index, which is to be released today, could undermine his recent strategy of betting on low inflation and stable to declining interest rates.   Mr. Labenski is one of the money managers who has not lost the belief that inflation is heading lower. The surge in inflation in the first four months of the year -- with the Consumer Price Index rising at a 4.3 percent annual rate -- has already forced many other managers to switch their strategies, giving up hope for lower inflation this year and expecting that interest rates will be stable to higher."

The agreement, which is expected to be announced today, would represent the first pact between a cable operator and a film company to release films simultaneously. However, one executive close to Carolco said that the deal would apply to only four or five films annually during a four- or five-year period. He said Tele-Communications would probably charge viewers $20 to $40 a film.  Deal Worth $100 Million    The deal would give Carolco a needed infusion of capital. Tele-Communications would invest $100 million in Carolco in two parts: an equity stake in the company and a purchase of pay-per-view rights. However, the initial equity investment would be relatively small, according to another executive familiar with the deal. In addition, the partners would share in the pay-per-view revenues."

Some have charged that the Clinton Administration has reversed years of America's commitment to free trade. But the real concern among some trade experts is not that the policy itself is new; it is the assertive new way President Clinton is using the old techniques of managed trade that were accepted when they were employed by the Bush and Reagan Administrations.   As one of its trade initiatives, the Clinton Administration has pushed for the devaluation of the dollar against the yen. This is expected to reduce America's trade imbalance by making Japanese goods more expensive in the United States and American products cheaper here. The dollar has already plummeted in value against the yen, hitting a post-World War II low in Tokyo trading today of 111 yen to the dollar. That was the ninth new low for the dollar against the yen in the last 13 trading days.  [ Page D25. ]"

Says It Placed Fatal Bomb; London Markets Rush to Reopen,"  As officials scrambled to help banks and securities firms find temporary offices, the I.R.A. confirmed today that it had planted the deadly bomb that exploded Saturday in London's financial district.   Despite extensive damage to a number of buildings, officials expect financial markets to open Monday and to operate at nearly normal levels.    The bomb killed one person, wounded 44 others and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage when it went off in a parked truck in the heart of the City, as the financial district is known. Two Taxis Hijacked    Although the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility, its statement early today made no mention of two smaller bombs in London late Saturday night; they destroyed two taxicabs but caused no injuries.    The police said men with Irish accents tried to force the drivers of two cabs to drive them to their targets -- Prime Minister John Major's official residence at 10 Downing Street and Scotland Yard's headquarters -- but leaped out when the cabs were still far from their destinations. Both drivers fled before the bombs, which had been left in their cabs, went off.   If the bombings provoked one general reaction among the public, it was a sense that the Government and the police must step up their efforts against the I.R.A., which is waging a terrorist campaign to end British rule of Northern Ireland.   ""We are not getting results,"" said David Mellor, a former member of Mr. Major's Cabinet. ""The terrorists have ripped the heart out of the City of London, putting at risk lives, livelihoods and indeed the position of the City,"" he told the Press Association, a British news agency.  The Hunt for Clues    The explosion in the financial district left a 15-foot-wide crater in the street, shattered windows in dozens of buildings and sent shards raining down over several square blocks. Today the police continued a painstaking search for clues among the debris as officials sought to help banks, brokerage houses and other companies minimize the impact on their business.   ""The Prime Minister and I agreed that the best way to frustrate the terrorists is to have the City back at work tomorrow, and we are working hard to insure that it is,"" said Sir Francis McWilliams, the Lord Mayor.   Thousands of workers will be unable to enter offices in the buildings that took the brunt of the blast, including the 52-story National Westminster Bank tower, which lost most of its windows, and the headquarters of the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation, whose lobby was destroyed. Most companies said that they were arranging for other office space and that they did not expect any major disruption. Estimating Losses    Initial estimates of the damage ran as high as $1.5 billion. But the Association of British Insurers said these estimates could prove highly inaccurate. The group noted that the initial assessment from a bomb explosion in the City a year ago, which caused extensive damage to the Baltic Exchange and nearby offices, was also $1.5 billion; the cost of repairs proved to be less than a third of that.   Some of the cost is expected to be borne by insurance companies and by the Lloyds of London insurance market. But much may fall to the Government, which agreed earlier this year to serve as an insurer of last resort for the many building owners who were finding it impossible or too expensive to get coverage against terrorism.   It was the most powerful explosion in London since an I.R.A. bomb went off in the area on April 10, 1992. Several I.R.A. attacks in recent months have been aimed at causing significant disruption as well as economic damage."

In recent public remarks, President Clinton has backed away from his campaign position that air strikes could be used to curb Serb aggression. And the weight of opinion within the Clinton Administration appears to be to rely on economic sanctions to try to slow the fighting."

The number of people saving for retirement has jumped over last year and I.R.A.'s are the most popular plan, according to a survey last month by Fidelity Investments and the Gallup Organization.  But much of the I.R.A. money, analysts say, flows into exactly the wrong places. Nearly 20 percent of the $211 billion invested in mutual funds as of the end of 1992 was stashed in supersafe -- but low-yield -- money market funds, and an even bigger chunk was in bond funds, according to the Investment Company Institute.   The reason is that most people do not understand the real risk of investing for several decades: Inflation. Over time, only the stock market, despite its greater risks, has proven an effective hedge against inflation. The reason? Capital growth."

All three said Serbian deeds, not promises, were needed before there could be any relaxation in the search for peace.

Bears and bulls spread rumors. Price changes create their own momentum as traders decide it is foolish to fight the tape. Short-term gyrations can be wildly irrational, more easily explained by the games traders play than by economic factors.   All that was evident in Wall Street's wild week, which saw the Dow Jones industrial average close over 3,500 for a couple of days before dropping 30 points on Friday. Some suggested the rise amounted to a market forecast that economic growth was going to pick up soon, but economically sensitive issues lagged.

While it is a crime in most other industrial countries, trading on insider information is not illegal in Germany and it is not unusual. The eight German stock exchanges try to prohibit it by a gentlemen's agreement, under which suspicious cases are investigated by an insider-trading commission appointed by the exchanges. But the penalties are seldom more than a slap on the wrist, such as forcing insider traders to forfeit all or part of their profits. The commission is now investigating Mr. Steinkuhler, president of the I. G. Metall metal workers union -- Germany's biggest union -- on a transaction that netted him a profit of 64,000 marks, or about $40,500."

A capital gains amnesty period could accomplish these desirable objectives.  Higher capital gains tax rates have led to less tax revenue, not more. At the end of 1986, the rate jumped from 20 percent to 28 percent. After that, from 1987 through 1991, an average of $135 billion in gains were realized each year, with the figure falling steadily after 1987. By contrast, many rational people sold assets in late 1986, taking advantage of the lower rate. Realized gains hit $326 billion that year, nearly double the 1985 total."

The announcement was made in a decree signed by the military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who said ""these steps were taken to save our judiciary from being ridiculed and politicized locally and internationally."""

Nor is it as vexing as when, as Prime Minister, he had what he described as an ""exasperating"" meeting in New York with John Cardinal O'Connor at which he failed to persuade the Cardinal to publicly condemn the violence of the outlawed Irish Republican Army."

Job,"  After long deliberations, the Clinton Administration today nominated Arthur Levitt Jr., a publisher and former head of the American Stock Exchange, as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   The selection of Mr. Levitt had been expected for weeks, but was held up by a number of factors: the required review of his finances; a politically sensitive decision to pass over an aide to Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and a backlog in reviewing candidates for a long list of other Administration financial positions that remain unfilled."

She was not the oldest volunteer.   As the Peace Corps expands the range and depth of its services to emerging countries, newly required skills are reshaping the image of the traditional volunteer. With the demand for entrepreneurial experience in Eastern Europe and an increasing number of volunteers deciding to stay in, the profile of a typical Peace Corps worker has changed. In 1963 the average age of Peace Corps volunteers was 22. Now the average volunteer is 30."

Investors in the Reader's Digest Association have learned that lesson. An unclear warning from the publishing giant in February about the performance of its American book and home entertainment division drove down its stock price as investors' imaginations ran wild. The company's management also refused for months to clear up the uncertainty."

Finds Pension Risk In Funds Shifted to Insurers,"  Millions of people whose pensions have been transferred to insurance companies are inadequately protected because of gaps in state guaranty programs and weak oversight by the Federal Government, according to a report released today by the General Accounting Office.   The report focuses on the estimated three million to four million individuals whose pension plans have been transferred to insurers in the form of annuities. Since the mid-1980's, failures of insurance companies have increased sharply, and today's report was compiled at the urging of members of Congress whose constituents have lost partial pension benefits when insurers failed."

General Morillon, who assumed the post in March last year, has been fiercely criticized by leaders of Serbian nationalists in Bosnia for his recent efforts to lift the siege of the eastern town of Srebrenica. Many Bosnian Serbs charge that he has taken sides with Bosnia's Muslims in the conflict."

It was eastern Germany's first legal strike in more than 60 years. Strikes were outlawed under the Nazis and then by the region's Communist rulers.

The surprise in the May jobs report was twofold. First, the increase in nonfarm payroll jobs of 209,000 in the month was higher than the consensus forecast of about 140,000, showing that the economy was spunkier than expected. The second surprise was the revision of the April increase, which was raised to 216,000 from the initial report of 119,000."

The announcement came during a session of the Supreme People's Assembly. Western analysts said the move strengthened Mr. Kim's authority over the North Korean military and removed most lingering doubts over whether he would eventually succeed his father, Kim Il Sung, as President. The elder Mr. Kim turns 81 next week."

That cash no doubt played a big role in driving stock prices up this month, particularly last week when the Dow Jones industrial average topped 3,500 for the first time.   That cash built up because fund managers were unable or unwilling to invest all of the record $11.6 billion that investors put into stock funds in April. Fund managers said big inflows continued this month, but most said the pace had slowed a bit."

Last week, three armies were challenging the city's hospitality during the Comdex/ Spring computer trade show: Microsoft unfurled its Windows NT battle flags, I.B.M. sent in reinforcements for its OS/2 software, and the grizzled veterans of Unix found some fresh horses to ride.    The combativeness was just one more sign that the personal computer industry is at a crossroads. Microsoft, through DOS and Windows, clearly owns the office desktop today, but despite Windows's huge popularity, the program was designed to run on microprocessors that virtually nobody uses anymore. Windows does not take advantage of 32-bit microprocessors, which include the Intel Corporation's i386DX and i486DX chips, the workhorses of the typical office. So many corporate information system managers are now trying to decide just which advanced operating system should be the platform on which to carry their PC operations into the 21st century."

The board had initially voted June 1 to reject Bank of Boston's bid to acquire the Multibank Financial Corporation, a chain of local banks based in Dedham, Mass., with $2.36 billion in assets. But the board reconsidered the proposal after the Bank of Boston, which has $32 billion in assets, agreed to raise $170 million in new capital. Revised Application Opposed    Three Federal Reserve governors, David W. Mullins Jr., Edward W. Kelley Jr. and Lawrence Lindsey, abstained from the vote on the Multibank acquisition. They later released a sharply worded dissent saying that the Bank of Boston should not have been allowed to modify its capital plan after the application was submitted."

Now the affair has implicated one of the nation's dearest institutions: mah-jongg.   Developed in China, mah-jongg is an ancient, four-handed game played a bit like gin rummy, but using ivory or plastic tiles. Young men generally learn it at school, developing a lifelong passion for the gambling and bonhomie essential to the game. It is a rite of passage not just into adulthood but into the back rooms of the political world."

But on June 18, when Mr. Miyazawa lost a vote of confidence in the Japanese Diet, traders threw out fundamentals, pushing the dollar up more than three yen."

Maybe the Balkans are in flames, the recovery is guttering out and Mr. Clinton's chief of staff needs to start carding his new hires. But those are not the only reasons Mr. Clinton's ratings are going phttt! He is taking the hit for business-as-usual, filibustering Washington, which seems not to have noticed that many Americans feel the country is adrift and that they think their feelings, like the Velveteen Rabbit, are really real.   As Mr. Clinton looks for ways to regain his Administration's composure, he could start by sending several cartons of Katherine S. Newman's new book, ""Declining Fortunes: The Withering of the American Dream"" (Basic Books), over to the Hill and down to the lobbyists on K Street. Ms. Newman, an anthropologist, spent many months talking with 60 or so intergenerational families in a suburban New Jersey town she calls ""Pleasanton,"" both to disguise its identity and to indicate that it stands in for communities across the country. She learned that high anxiety about the future has become the permanent existential state of young and youngish suburban middle-class Americans."

The changes would bring to Europe the same kind of upheaval in telecommunications already under way in the United States, with the aim of benefiting both consumers and businesses by bringing down strikingly high rates and improving less-than-stellar service. Open Markets    State-controlled phone companies in Germany, France, Belgium and other countries would presumably be forced to go head to head for the first time on their home turf with the likes of British Telecom, the lone major European phone company to have completed the transformation to market competitor, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which is investing heavily in the region, as are other American companies."

When about 25 people lining up to vote in an abandoned furniture salesroom were asked as a group if they were for or against the peace plan, there were thumbs-down gestures and shouts of ""Protiv! Protiv!"" -- meaning against."

The system has become increasingly expensive -- we paid $800 billion in 1992 alone -- and we have 37 million uninsured. But no plan will succeed unless we reorient our thinking, and address the essential issues.  One reason medical care has become so impersonal and high-priced is that physicians are not rewarded for bedside medicine. In our society, primary-care doctors do not exert as much influence as specialists do. Much can be achieved by low-tech medicine and personal contact, but high-tech tests are more lucrative and less time-consuming. A gastroenterologist will not hesitate to do a gastroscopy on a patient with vague abdominal discomfort because he is paid handsomely for the procedure, while he gets meager compensation for doing a thorough physical examination. No wonder that from 1965 to 1990, the number of gastroenterologists has increased more than 1000 percent, while the number of primary-care doctors has gone up only 66 percent."

To Move Against North Koreans,"  The International Atomic Energy Agency declared today that North Korea had violated its obligations to open its suspected nuclear weapons sites to inspections. For the first time, the agency asked the United Nations Security Council to enforce the provisions of international agreements intended to limit the spread of nuclear arms.   The action, at a special meeting of the agency's board of governors, came a day after North Korea defied the latest deadline to permit inspectors into two sites near Yongbyon, a heavily guarded nuclear installation that American intelligence satellites suggest would provide evidence of how close the Communist Government is to producing a bomb. North Korea declared three weeks ago that it was withdrawing from the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear arms, but the action does not take effect until June."

Vance, the United Nations' mediator, and Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator, was ""a good basis for agreement,"" and that between 70 percent and 80 percent of the territorial division of Bosnia proposed in the plan was acceptable.

Short sales rose to another new high in the latest month, continuing a streak of records that began in September 1991, but the Nasdaq composite index also advanced.    The shorts suffered the greatest pain while building their positions in some issues, like Snapple, whose continuing price gains stand to confound the laws of finance and investment. In other runaway stocks, like Cisco Systems, some short-sellers evidently decided they could bear no more, and bought the stock to end their losses."

Delegates to the parliament share an almost mystic conviction that all Serbs, wherever in the Balkans they find themselves, have a historic right to live under Serbian rule. But if they vote on Wednesday to accept the international peace plan for Bosnia, it will be principally out of deference to the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milo sevic, and his judgment that the peace plan will do less harm to the dream of a Greater Serbia than the threatened military intervention and tighter economic sanctions that would be the international response to continued Serbian defiance."

But more than one Honda Motor Company executive told him, he recalls, that to get all the cars he wanted to sell he would have to ""play the game.""    During the next eight years, Mr. Roulette concedes, he played the game faithfully, showering Honda executives with gifts -- a car, jewelry, a stereo system, barbecue grills and thousands of dollars in cash.

They are in their 20's, 30's and 40's, male and female, racially and ethnically diverse. All have survived struggles with alcohol as well as other drugs like heroin and cocaine. All have long since been through detox, a 28-day treatment program and in some cases a relapse or two.    They are in a room telling their stories to a guest because they are either graduates or residents of a new program in New York run by the Hazelden Foundation that allows them to balance a job and a course of recovery. Maureen G. talks of living on the streets and poking through garbage cans for food, Tony C. of the breakup of his marriage, Mike S. of his ""life and death decision"" to seek help. The stories of loss, betrayal and despair are hard to bring into phase with the clear-eyed faces and calm, self-possessed voices."

More surprising, perhaps, is that the postponement is also generating relief among some economists who worry that reform would take too big a slice out of the economy at a time when it could ill afford it.    Whatever form the final proposal takes, a fresh start on the way care is delivered and financed is bound to set off wrenching structural changes and job cuts in an economy already reeling from industrial retrenchment. And it is likely to slow the development of technology that generates billions of dollars in exports."

Neither Mr. Rollwagen nor the company he formerly headed, the supercomputer manufacturer Cray Research Inc., has been accused of wrongdoing. But the Senate Commerce Committee has postponed confirming Mr. Rollwagen's nomination as Deputy Secretary of Commerce because the Securities and Exchange Commission is asking new questions about stock sales in 1991 of the Cray Computer Corporation, a spinoff of Cray Research.

Diplomats said that several days of talks that began in Washington over the weekend had failed so far to convince Haiti's elected president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to grant immunity from prosecution to the commanders, even though the amnesty is widely seen as the last major piece in a settlement that would restore Father Aristide to power after 18 months in exile."
