The deficit in February was $12.2 billion. The new figures provided clear evidence of the impact on the United States -- both good and bad -- of Asia's mounting economic woes. Growth in the American economy, which had been threatening to overheat, was restrained. But at the same time, United States exports remained weak, hurting many manufacturers and farmers, and imports surged, a trend that does not bode well for the long term.    INTEREST RATES  No Increase, for Now  The Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee declined once again to increase short-term interest rates, apparently viewing the threat of inflation as remote and believing that any American rate increase could worsen the economic situation in Asia. Underlying the benign view of inflation are a number of recent indicators, including a 2.3 percent decline in new housing starts last month, to an annual rate of 1.538 million units. Many analysts had expected a small gain. Minutes of the Fed's March 31 meeting show that it saw a risk of inflation but decided to hold rates steady because of Asia's malaise.    MARKETS  Commodity Index Skids  The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities skidded to its lowest level in more than four years, dropping to 219.27 on Tuesday and ending the week at 219.18. Futures prices for copper, silver, oil, nickel, wheat and other commodities have been in a long-term decline that has been aggravated in recent days by Indonesia's political turmoil and -- see a pattern here? -- the Asian economic collapse. Stock and bond markets were little changed for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 9,144.44, up 48.44. But technology stocks were battered, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 41.77, to close at 1,805, its weakest level in more than six weeks.    TOBACCO  A Pipe Dream?  Anti-smoking legislation hit a potentially serious snag in the Senate, and further action was postponed until next month, sending President Clinton; Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other Senate leaders who want to deter teen-agers' smoking back to the drafting table. Just as it appeared a consensus was forming to increase the Federal tax on cigarettes by $1.10 a pack while giving tobacco companies some protection against lawsuits, an unusual coalition of senators formed. Some want to kill the legislation, while others advocate the toughest possible anti-smoking measure. ''We are making a deal with the Devil,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who opposes any limit on the companies' legal liability.    SOCIAL SECURITY  A Market-Based Proposal  The National Commission on Retirement Policy, which includes members of Congress from both parties, proposed a sweeping overhaul of the Social Security system, calling for the establishment of personal investment accounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age, to 70, to make up for a cash shortfall expected when 77 million baby boomers become eligible for Social Security benefits. ''The goal of this is to have people more involved in their own savings,'' said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a leader of the group, which includes lawmakers, economists, pension-system experts and business executives. The report says the changes would keep Social Security solvent for at least 75 years without raising taxes. Some liberals, however, oppose any plan that does not offer guaranteed benefits.    DEALS  A Merger Epidemic  What would once have been a big deal seems today to be business as usual. Seagram, accelerating its shift from beverages and spirits into an entertainment powerhouse, agreed to buy Polygram, one of the world's largest music companies, for $10.6 billion in cash and stock; to raise money for the acquisition, Seagram is shedding its Tropicana juice business. . . . Pearson, Britain's largest publisher, and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, a Dallas investment firm, agreed to buy most of Simon & Schuster's operations from Viacom for $4.6 billion in cash. . . . Office Depot said it would acquire Viking Office Products in a $3 billion stock swap. . . . Dillard's said it would acquire Mercantile Stores, a Midwest retailer, for $2.9 billion in cash. . . . Fortis, a Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group, agreed to acquire Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest, for $11.1 billion. . . . Francois Pinault, the French investor who bought 29.1 percent of Christie's earlier this month, said he would buy the rest in a deal that values the international auction house at $1.2 billion. . . . Royal Ahold extended its reach into the American supermarket business with a $2.6 billion deal for Giant Food Inc.    VIAGRA  Worldwide Demand  Viagra, intended to help impotent men, has yet to pass clinical tests in Taiwan, but it is already selling for $59 on the black market there. In Taipei, a nurse displayed a bag of the medication. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration reported on Friday that Pfizer Inc. had said that six patients taking the drug had died, although it was unknown if Viagra played any role in the deaths. A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said the agency was investigating but continued to believe the drug was safe and effective and had asked Pfizer to provide more information to patients on the proper use of the drug. Pfizer's stock fell $3.69, to $105.44.  "

As portfolio manager of the bank's closed-end New Germany fund, a $665 million growth fund invested primarily in midsize German companies, Mr. Ackermann is deploying money to pursue some of those opportunities. And as a Swiss citizen, he sees firsthand the significance of being inside or outside the euro club.   SHARON R. KING    Q. How will investing in Europe change as a result of the creation of the single European currency?   A. The top-down style of selecting stocks, where you analyze country, industry and then go down to the stock level, probably becomes irrelevant. The opposite of that is a bottom-up manager, which basically is our style. We really don't look at macro themes, but much more company-specific data.     The concept of the country fund itself at some point will probably have to be wider. I can imagine that some funds might consider changing to a more European-based fund.   Q. How should American investors be thinking about the part of their portfolio that they will invest in a changing Europe?   A. Before, you had different countries, like Germany and France, individually fighting for market share. They all looked insignificant relative to a large country like the United States. Now this is changing. You have a major competitor -- let's just call it Europe. It has a much more powerful industrial base. It will not be inhibited by any cross-border taxation or inefficiencies.     What we're going to see here is a major structural change, much higher efficiency. I think that there will probably be more money allocated to Europe than in the past.   Q. What about countries that remain outside the monetary union?   A. For a country like Britain, it's probably less of an issue to be in or out, because it's a much larger economy with much less dependence on Europe. The U.K. has had more cross-border alliances with the United States than with Europe, so it will be easier for the U.K. to stand outside and to remain outside.    In the case of Switzerland, I see difficulties for that country to stay out and to compete with the border restrictions.    I'm not sure how much the financial sector will be affected, but you could see some impact mainly from the currency translation on other manufacturing sectors.    Right now the Swiss franc is relatively strong, and that's obviously damaging the export industry. But currency fluctuations may make it difficult for corporations to plan ahead. For the smaller European countries, sooner or later they're going to be forced into the same situation, where there will be an overwhelming economic case for joining the European Monetary Union. So, my guess will be they're all going to join over time.   Q. Will companies in countries outside of the monetary union have growth problems?   A. Yes. Distribution will be a problem.    I'm from Switzerland. When I walk through customs in Europe, they treat me like any other passport holder. But if you are part of the union, they basically just wave you through.    The same effect will probably occur on any distribution or licensing agreement. You would rather give the members of the union preferential treatment. So obviously there's an advantage to being part of the union.   Q. From an investment standpoint, will countries outside of the monetary union be riskier?   A. They should be. You're dealing with higher currency risk; then you have the economic risk of not gaining access to the same markets. There's even a risk of size, which means a liquidity risk.   Q. How do you pick stocks for the bank's funds?   A. There are five criteria. The most important is earnings momentum, to which we allocate roughly one-third of the investment decision-making.     Another third would be management. We look at the track record and the commitment to enhance the company's value. The final third is split between the financial strength of the company and its overall value versus the industry, the stock's history and the market itself.    Q. What are some stocks you own that fit your criteria?   A. One of our biggest holdings is Adidas. We have 8.6 percent of the fund in that company. They have acquired Salomon, the ski producer. When we look at other companies like Nike, or Puma in Europe, most of them have lost market share to Adidas-Salomon. And this is one of the few true growth stories in Germany, in our belief.    This company has excellent management. We see roughly 20 to 25 percent earnings growth consistently into the year 2000.     What's not included in that figure yet is the effects of the Salomon acquisition. Salomon has had its strength mainly in France, and Adidas has had its strength mostly in Germany. But now there should be a massive benefit from synergies.    We also like Continental A.G. We have about 4.3 percent of the fund in that. Continental has had compound earnings growth of about 25 percent for three years, and I think it has been overlooked by the market.     What's interesting is that they're really a leader in technology. There's huge free cash flow, and 1998 should be a turnaround year for the company as margins increase.    In Europe there are two other major tire companies, Pirelli and Michelin.

In negotiations, Beijing has suggested trading off its missile cooperation in the Middle East for American commitments to cut arms sales sharply to Taiwan,  a possibility criticized by American Republicans like the former American Ambassador to China and representative to Taiwan, James R.

Two economic indicators released early last week suggested that the economy was throttling back from the heated pace it reached earlier this year. Sales of previously owned homes fell in April, while consumer confidence edged lower this month. Existing-home sales in the United States declined 2.5 percent last month, to an annual rate of 4.77 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. And the Conference Board said its measure of consumer confidence declined to 135.2 in May, from 137.2 a month ago. A few days later, however, the Commerce Department reported that the economy in the first quarter was even stronger than initially reported. The gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent, up from the earlier estimate of 4.2 percent. Not to be outdone by upbeat assessments, President Clinton said he now expected the budget surplus for 1998 to hit $39 billion."

The merged company would have a market value of $92 billion and a vehicle lineup ranging from the little Plymouth Neon to the luxurious Mercedes-Benz S-Class, with Jeeps, mini-vans, pickups and less-expensive Mercedes sedans in between. ''Today, we are creating the world's leading automotive company for the 21st century,'' said Jurgen E. Schrempp, Daimler's chairman. Another German auto maker, Volkswagen, one-upped BMW, persuading Vickers P.L.C. of Britain to accept its $710 million bid for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.    THE ECONOMY  Racking Up Sales  The auto industry's sales showed unexpected strength in April, rising 6.3 percent over April 1997 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.5 million. Heavy mortgage refinancings have given buyers extra money to spend and hefty rebates have drawn them to showrooms. Other economic reports also showed continuing strength, with the unemployment rate falling to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in April from 4.7 percent in March. Still, the Federal Reserve found inflation benign as economic growth continued in March and April. Factory orders rose a moderate 0.3 percent in March, while the Conference Board's index of leading indicators rose 0.2 percent. Retail sales rose 10.2 percent in April, the best monthly sales gains in four years. But worker productivity grew in the first quarter at the slowest pace in more than a year, rising at an annualized rate of 0.2 percent.    MARKETS  Nervous, Then Buoyant  With investors fearful that the Fed might push up interest rates, stock prices, buoyed just weeks ago by big bank mergers, were battered for the better part of the week. But Friday's strong jobs report erased the gloom, and market indexes resumed their winning ways. One of the most chaotic bouts of trading in memory came with Entremed, which may or may not find a cure for cancer. Investors bid its stock up $39.75, to $51.81, in chaotic trading on Monday, but by the end of the week it was down to $33.25. The Dow industrials ended the week down 91.92 points at 9,055.15, and the yield on the long bond rose to 5.97 percent.    THE BUDGET  A Growing Surplus  The nation's fiscal condition is improving at a startling pace. Tax collections surged in late April, with much of the money apparently coming from capital gains chalked up in last year's strong stock market. The Congressional Budget Office now sees a $43 billion to $63 billion surplus this year. After years of trying to reduce the deficit, Washington is now deeply divided over what to do with the surplus -- cut taxes, save Social Security or pay for other programs. Saying it could reduce borrowing, the Treasury will eliminate the three-year note.    PEOPLE  A Survivor's Victory  Estelle Sapir, 72, of Far Rockaway, Queens, whose health is failing, emerged as a rare victor in Holocaust survivors' battle with Swiss Banks. Credit Suisse, which her father had entrusted with his money before perishing in the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland, finally settled her claim for an estimated $500,000. For decades, the bank had demanded a death certificate -- something the Nazis had failed to provide. . . . Francois Pinault, a wealthy French investor, has bought 29.1 percent of Christie's, the London auction house. . . . Sidney Taurel, Eli Lilly's president and an expert in drug marketing, will become chief executive on July 1 and chairman on Dec. 31, succeeding Randall L. Tobias, who has decided to retire.    TECHNOLOGY  Fractious Growth  Microsoft, caught in a web of antitrust battles that threaten to delay the scheduled June introduction of its Windows 98 operating system, persuaded a number of computer industry leaders to back its case for no delay. . . . Compaq Computer will cut 15,000 jobs at Digital Equipment, or 28 percent of Digital's work force, after the companies complete their merger, an executive disclosed. . . . Whatever the industry's internal problems, users keep increasing. With new subscribers growing, America Online reported profits that sharply ecceeded analysts' expectations. . . . Steve Jobs, the interim chief executive who is nursing Apple Computer back to health, showed a new version of the company's G-3 computer with a shark on its screen in Cupertino, Calif, on Wednesday.    WALL STREET  Goodbye, Arbitration?  A proposed settlement of a discrimination suit filed by women brokers against Merrill Lynch could lead to the end of Wall Street's system for dealing with employee cases through mandatory arbitration, allowing cases to go into open court . . . Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced that Nationsbank, one of the country's largest financial institutions, had agreed to pay almost $7 million to settle charges that it misled customers who bought two bond funds in 1993-94. The announcement came as bankers and brokers lobbied for a sweeping overhaul of the laws separating their institutions. So far, Congress has not voted on the issue.    CHOCOLATE  A Bitter Forecast  Gold in short supply? Silver will do. Fine wines scarce? Plonk will do. But a shortage of chocolate? What's the world to do? With demand exceeding production of cocoa beans, the world's reserves could run out within 5 to 10 years. Consequently, an unusual alliance of manufacturers and environmental groups has formed to tackle the problem. Representatives of the Mars, Cadbury, Nestle and Hershey chocolate companies met with conservation groups last month at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama to discuss how to save farms under siege worldwide from insects and from fungal and viral diseases.    I.R.S.  Senate Votes for Overhaul  After hearing taxpayers' horror stories and complaints about the tax code's ever-increasing complexity, the Senate voted 97 to 0 to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service. Among other changes intended to make the I.R.S. more friendly to citizens, the bill would create an independent board to oversee the agency and establish an independent taxpayer advocate. To assure that collections are not unduly hampered, the White House said it would press for some changes when a joint committee reconciles the bill and a narrower version passed last year by the House. . . . Shirley Barron, who accused the I.R.S. in a $1 million lawsuit of driving her husband to suicide, said that the agency had agreed to a settlement that would eliminate her tax debt of more than $400,000 and let her keep her New Hampshire home.

Eugene Melnyk, the chairman of Biovail Pharmaceuticals in Toronto, shares Mr. Sands's ambivalence. ''Owning a big boat,'' he groused, ''is like owning a second business.''    But help for both, and for others who can  live neither with their yachts nor without them, may be on the way. And it is coming from an unlikely source: Irwin L. Jacobs, the 1980's corporate raider known as ''Irv the Liquidator'' for his habit of acquiring ailing companies and playing musical chairs with the assets.    Well, perhaps it is not so unlikely. When the game ended, Mr. Jacobs's portfolio included a dozen boat manufacturers, including Hatteras, the high-end yacht maker in New Bern, N.C. With fewer opportunities for slicing and dicing corporations, he put his restless mind to marketing their products -- notably, the million-dollar-plus behemoths turned out by Hatteras.    ''When I asked people at boat shows why they didn't own yachts,'' Mr. Jacobs explained, ''price was an issue, but so was the hassle factor.''    Never one to run with the crowd -- he once installed a delicatessen in a boat showroom in Minnesota to increase foot traffic -- Mr. Jacobs went looking for an unconventional solution to both problems.    Hardly anybody wants to spend more than a few months a year aboard a yacht, he reasoned. And hardly anybody with realistic aspirations of owning an ocean-going trophy has the time or inclination to tend to the details of keeping it provisioned and shipshape.    The solution, perhaps inspired by the latest fashion in sales of private jets: Yachtscape, a partial-ownership program in which access to a super-luxe, fully equipped Hatteras yacht is divided into thirds, while a management company handles everything from providing the crews to catering the cocktail parties to finding the perfect beach for sunbathing in the buff.     Indeed, the managers' job is part mundane maintenance, part European-style concierge service in which no client's wish is beyond reach. ''We're not just selling a boat; we're selling a life style,'' said Mr. Jacobs, testing his sales pitch.    Yachtscape's first two fiberglass beauties from Hatteras, the 74-foot Courageous with five bedrooms and the 65-foot Vigilant with four, are now on the block. Each of the three shares in the Courageous costs $1 million, or a third of what a single owner would pay for the boat. For this, plus an annual fee of $259,000, each part-owner is entitled to six 14-day cruises annually, which would keep the boat in use a total of 36 weeks a year.    The remaining 113 days are reserved for maintenance, weather-related down time and the scheduling convenience of the owners. With this many days of slack, potential conflicts over the use of the yacht at holidays should be minimized, Mr. Jacobs says.    Paying operating fees that are more than $3,000 a day, the owners of Courageous will presumably expect a lot, and Yachtscape aims to exceed their expectations. Everything needed to operate the boat -- a crew of two and back-up personnel, insurance, dockage fees and full maintenance -- is included. ''If a critical part breaks while the boat is cruising the coast of Siberia, we'll have a replacement there within 24 hours,'' Mr. Jacobs said.    A tour of Courageous, docked recently at Manhattan's Chelsea Piers, confirmed that clients needn't fear for their comfort, either. The yacht is exceptionally well appointed, with glitzy bathrooms attached to every bedroom, satellite TV's and telephones scattered about the living quarters like coasters.     The decor is Beverly Hills contemporary, with surfaces covered in natural fibers, mirrors, Hatteras's signature blonde-maple paneling -- or, in the case of the galley counters, granite. An inflatable outboard runabout and a Sea-Doo personal watercraft grace the rear deck.    ''In short, everything is included except food and fuel,'' said Ralph Vick, the managing director of Yachtscape, who earned his spurs indulging the whims of the well-heeled while working for the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain.     Of course, the three owners of Courageous will be masters of their domain only for discrete periods of the year. But management will swim the last lap to minimize the sense of sharing. Each owner will have separate sets of bed and bath linens. Each owner's clothes and accessories will be stored between cruises. Yachtscape is even prepared to juggle crews among boats if a particular owner finds that the chemistry with the help is wrong.    Kenneth Cancellara, the general counsel of Biovail, is ''98 percent sure'' he will buy a share of Courageous and expects to use the boat with friends and family. Mr. Melnyk, who is close to signing on for his own piece of the yacht, will probably mix business with pleasure.     But Mr. Sands, the investment banker,  sees the boat primarily as a capitalist tool. ''We're constantly entertaining, bringing together securities issuers and institutional buyers,'' he said.    Indeed, Mr. Jacobs envisions a big corporate market for share ownership, with buyers using cruises to reward star employees and stroke clients. ''A yacht cruise is the ultimate perk,'' he said.    And what if the partial ownership experience sours -- or if an owner decides to renounce his wealth and enter a monastery? Yachtscape stands ready to buy back shares for half the purchase price after 35 months. Probably more relevant, it will serve as a broker, finding buyers for orphaned shares for a predetermined commission.    Mr. Jacobs does not expect it to come to that very often. Indeed, he is projecting sales of an extra 50 yachts a year -- Hatteras now builds about 100 -- to satisfy the new market. Some may be specially equipped for fishing, while others may tap into the lavish fantasies of latter-day King Farouks.    What is the biggest boat he is prepared to sell in pieces? If the demand is there, Mr. Jacobs said, Hatteras can provide 130-footers. The tentative price is $3 million for each of three shares, plus $455,000 annual maintenance. The line forms to the right.

Big, red round apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they had a light, candy taste.

And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.  "
