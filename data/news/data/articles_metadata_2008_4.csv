They said he was unwelcome because of what they called his hostile position toward Israel and put him on a flight back to Geneva the next day. Mr. Falk could not be reached before publication to defend himself. Given Professor Falk’s initial unavailability, The Times tried unsuccessfully to get comment from United Nations officials in Jerusalem and Geneva before the article was printed, but did not try as it should have done to reach United Nations officials in New York. A spokesman for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, had said in a press release that Mr. Falk “should have been allowed to transit Israel to the Palestinian territories to do his job.” Professor Falk said last week that he was not hostile to Israel, but critical of its occupation policy."
