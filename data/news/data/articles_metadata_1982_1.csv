Further reductions, analysts say, are all but certain.  Since last April, the national average price of gasoline has dropped by about a nickel, to $1.35, according to Platt's Oil Price Report, a trade publication. The decline in pump prices is in marked contrast to the near-tripling between 1973 and last April. (Page A1.)   China opened its offshore waters to foreign oil companies for exploration and production, beginning a new phase in its economic cooperation. Peking is seeking quick development of an energy source that it hopes will supply fuel for decades. Bids were invited from 46 companies from 12 countries. In all, 23 American companies were said to have expressed interest. (D1.)"

The death toll from the unseasonal cold spreading across northern Europe rose to at least 13.    In Britain, after one of the coldest nights on record, the police warned drivers to stay off the highways unless ''absolutely necessary.'' Snow and ice made dozens of roads in Wales impassable, and hundreds of cars were abandoned in snowdrifts up to 20 feet deep."

The import ban was imposed at a time when Turkey was forced to spend its hardcurrency earnings on oil products.

Nickel, President Reagan's nominee to be the United States Ambassador to South Africa, told a Senate confirmation hearing today that he favored ''peaceful change'' in southern Africa, but his support of Reagan Administration policies in the region drew criticism from two church-related groups.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to vote on Mr.  Nickel's nomination Tuesday.  Mr. Nickel, a former Time magazine correspondent and a onetime member of the board of editors of Fortune magazine, said revolutionary change in the region would provoke a ''major crisis for our allies and ourself and risk turning Africa into a theater of confrontation for the major powers.''   He said a policy of ''constructive engagement,'' using American economic involvement as a means of influencing South Africa, was the preferred way of insuring peaceful change in the region."

Last year, the new tax law also granted a retroactive break to parents who adopted hard-to-place children in 1981, permitting them to deduct some of their adoption-related expenses for the first time, and new court decisions liberalized the rules for theft and casualty losses.   Among other things, the courts approved a theft claim filed by a woman who had paid a divorce fee to a lawyer who had falsely told her he had obtained her divorce, and granted similar casualty deductions to taxpayers who did not seek reimbursement of their losses from their insurance companies.   Charitable contributions are one of the most common itemized deductions. But starting in 1982, even taxpayers who do not itemize will be able to subtract a certain portion of their donations (the limit is $25, or 25 percent of the first $100 in contributions by singles or ma rried persons filing jointly)."

The falling oil prices ''are the ace in the hole for the recovery we expect to be under way in the second half,'' said one Reagan planner, who added that the impact could be equivalent to a tax cut in spurring consumption. The decreases lie, in part, behind the forecast of Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan that the economy will come ''roaring back'' after sharp declines in the fourth quarter of 1981 and first quarter of this year.   Officials here consider it unlikely that the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which have just tried to revive their cartel at an emergency meeting in Vienna, can put into effect a scale of production cuts sufficient to arrest the slide. The oil ministers agreed last Friday to cut output by about 700,000 barrels a day"

Officially, both Indian and Soviet spokesmen described the visit - the first by Marshal Ustinov to any non-Communist country - as a show of amity and good will. The Indians, however, have sought to characterize the visit as just another in a series of exchanges that will not endanger Indian claims to following an independent foreign policy, while the Soviet visitors, arriving in such strength, were indicating their interest in at least maintaining their position as India's chief arms supplier.   ''The successful cooperation in the field of defense between the two countries serves both the national interests of India and the Soviet Union as well as the interests of strengthening of universal peace and security,'' Marshal Ustinov said on his arrival.  ''Indo-Soviet relations are developing steadily,'' added the Defense Minister, who is also a member of the Soviet Politburo."

In criticizing the Business Roundtable's recent statement on corporate responsibility, Professor MacAvoy stepped into Milton Friedman's shoes as the defender of another hoary adage, ''The business of business is business.'' Professor MacAvoy goes on to criticize the statement's lack of specificity in how to make the difficult trade-offs among the demands of these groups. That may be a fair criticism; but in asserting that corporate concern ''with community needs and problems'' as well as with ''the interest of society at large'' exceed a company's responsibilities, he ignores the necessary complexity of ''enlightened self-interest,'' flies in the face of current political realities, and runs smack into the Reagan Administration's drive to get the private sector to take up some of the slack caused by Federal budget cuts."

In the South African context, where demonstrations against white minority rule are almost automatically proclaimed to be ''riotous assemblies,'' it was a startling sight - almost certainly the largest display of black political feeling to have been seen in the white areas here since the Congress movement was forced underground in 1960 by a banning order.   The police, carrying riot equipment, were stationed along the route, but the procession was allowed to proceed, in defiance of laws that make it a crime to show support for a banned organization. When it came within half a mile of the segregated white cemetery where Dr. Neil Aggett was to be buried, the casket was removed from the hearse and carried in the front rank of the marchers who strode in front of a convoy of about 17 buses."

By ANDREW FEINBERG   I t's a well-known practice on Madison Avenue. An advertising agency buys a television program and sells it to a station, not for cash, in some instances, but for air time for commercials. The time is then entered into what's called a time bank, usually in a computer. Then, from the time bank, the agency sells its clients the time for their commercials.   The practice is known as bartering, and some barter deals are relatively straightforward. A variation called the tie-in barter, however, often finds the agency using its considerable leverage on the station to make the deal work. It might go something like this: Take the show and you'll get 40 percent of our business in your market. Reject it and you may suffer. Although agencies deny it, their critics say that their tactics are often coercive and unethical."

The losses leave White - once a billion-dollar-a-year maker of heavy-duty trucks, forklifts and farm equipment - with a negative net worth of nearly $70 million and very little prospect of ever restoring itself into a viable manufacturing concern, as it had hoped to do when it filed its bankruptcy petition in September 1980.   An official at the Cleveland-based corporation said that because of the downturn in the economy and the truck-building industry, and the loss of many key managers during the past 15 months, it was likely that White's remaining assets would eventually be liquidated to pay off as much of its debt as possible. The likelihood that the company would be revived or that its stockholders would receive anything for the nine million outstanding shares was ''very bleak,'' the official said."

It will require a balanced combination of policies commanding broad national support.   A plan to reduce the huge prospective deficits -a key element in the strategy for relieving the pressures on monetary policy and reducing interest rates - needs bipartisan support in Congress and genuine White House cooperation. This is likely to require a willingness on the part of the President to change the budget and tax priorities, to ease the burdens so heavily concentrated on the poor and the ''working poor,'' to scale down oversized tax cuts and to shape a military policy that relies less on ''throwing dollars at problems,'' and instead serves a comprehensive and coherent national security strategy, which has been lacking."

HOW TO BUILD YOUR ARK,"CRASH: It's a chilling word, and the thought that the economy might s ink into something akin to the 1930's experience has provoked a s pasm of apprehension across the country in the past few weeks.  From corporate board rooms to brokerage trading rooms, the fears are that: The Federal deficit will require so much debt capital that an economic upturn will never get under way; towering interest rates will lead to major bankruptcies; falling prices for commodities and real estate will snowball into a deflationary collapse; and the high unemployment and idle capacity plaguing the auto and home-building industries will spread nationwide.  There are any number of reasons to doubt this scenario. One is that depression anxiety is a natural psychological response to any deep recession. Also, as every contrary thinker knows, economic events that receive a lot of advance publicity often turn out to be duds.  Remember when gold was going to go to $3,000 an ounce, oil to $55 a barrel?"

Some analysts saw the lower prices as a disheartening sign of limited investor interest, while others were encouraged by the heavy volume and said it was an early sign of growing investor confidence that interest rates and inflation will be lower in coming years."

The cost of money ought to be falling and cheaper money, in time, ought to pull us out of recession.  There is scarcely an area of the economy that would not benefit from lower interest rates. Lower mortgage rates would revive the housing market after its worst year since 1946. Lower consumer loan rates would tempt people to buy more cars, and so benefit Detroit, which is going through its worst sales period in two decades. Lower bond rates would encourage business to borrow more to invest in the future. And lower rates generally would help the stock market, which has been in the doldrums for years.  That is how it should be. The reality is that interest rates, which fell a little near the end of 1981, are rising again, and what that will do to the economic outlook doesn't bear thinking about."

Figures released last Friday by the New York State Banking Department confirmed the seriousness of the situation. During the fourth quarter, New York City's 34 savings banks alone lost $337 million, with several of the larger banks rapidly running out of reserves.   The situation is similar across the country. Some officials are privately predicting that by year-end as many as 600 failing savings banks and savings and loan associations will need assistance from the Federal deposit-insurance agencies."

Zbigniew Karcz, head of the ministry's foreign department, said in a recent interview that without the cooperation of the 16 Western creditor nations, the elaborate plan worked out last year to give Poland breathing space in handling its total debt of $27 billion could collapse.   In response to the imposition of martial law in mid-December, representatives of the creditor nations told Poland that while arrangements for rescheduling the debts due in 1981 could stand, talks on rescheduling this year's debt, under a plan that had been agreed upon in principle, were being indefinitely postponed.   ''I am waiting for the normal situation with Western countries to be restored,'' Mr. Karcz said. ''Every week we wait is lost. It's not a secret that Poland will suffer most. I have said this many times during the talks in Paris. But Western countries will suffer also.''"

At a news conference in Madrid before flying here for talks, Mr.  Haig stressed the importance he attached to Western unity in the face of the military crackdown in Poland. He seemed to suggest that agreement within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was more important than pressuring individual members of the alliance into adopting sanctions against the Soviet Union.   ''Never before has there been such unanimity of views within the NATO alliance,'' Mr. Haig said.

To judge by the zeal of those working on it, a project was going on that seemed to be on the order of a NASA moon mission. An Emhart functionary, in fact, calculated that some 120 Emhart units would have three people apiece assigned to it, working 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, for 12 straight weeks.

Mr. Marshall, a 52-year-old former president of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company, was appointed an executive vice president, effective Feb. 1, after serving as A.T.& T. vice president for only about three months.

Coolidge Elkins since 1951. He took the business over from his father, who became a Chrysler dealer in 1926 after selling everything from Overlands to Stanley Steamers since 1918.   Elkins stands well away from ''automobile row,'' a service road just off of the main highway where most of Durham's other 13 automobile dealerships are found. But its 42,000 square feet of space make it the second-largest dealership in town, and it holds 10 percent of the automobile sales market in the Durham area, Mr. Elkins estimates.   Dealerships, these days, are a threatened species. The National Automobile Dealers Association reports that 900 of them went out of business last year and 1,650 the year before. There are now 25,700 dealers, while back in 1972 there were 30,100."

He was disappointed in Mr. Limann's lackluster performance, Mr.  Rawlings said to the friend, and he feared that his mistake had resulted in worsening economic and political conditions in Ghana through what he charged was the corruption of the Limann administration.   Three days ago, the 34-year-old former air force pilot moved to rectify his ''mistake'' by seizing power for the second time in two years in a military coup that toppled Mr. Liman n's Government.   The speculation among Western and African diplomats is that this time Mr. Rawlings will be less inclined to yield power quite so rapidly or readily as he did in September 1979. At that time, Mr.  Rawlings said recently, he just might have been ''naive, perhaps even too eager to believe that elected Ghanaians would necessarily slog hard to make a success of government.''"

Can he be turned on by selling life insurance policies for the Prudential Insurance Company? And what can Salomon Brothers, Wall Street's pre-eminent securities trader, get out of its new owner, the Phibro Corporation, a master commodities trader?   It was just under a year ago that the first of these mergers - the union of Prudential and Bache - shook the granite facade of Wall Street. Subsequently, several giants of other industries abruptly installed themselves as major forces in the securities business because they had read the same signals: The traditional businesses of banks, insurance companies, retailers, stock brokers and consumer lenders were breaking down and would give way to large, widely diversified purveyors of financial services. When once there was a single superbroker - Merrill Lynch - now there are five. Even the giant Bank of America bought discount broker Charles Schwab & Company, and the Bechtel Group absorbed Dillon, Read & Company."

But Dr. Andries Treurnicht, a former dominee, or minister, in the Dutch Reformed Church with an earned doctorate in philosophy, has battled against the heresy that white power, which he prefers to call ''white self-determination,'' can survive a little racial mixing in the social or political spheres.   In recent years, as spokesman for the unrepentant right wing of the governing National Party and the party's leader in the crucial Transvaal Province, he has waged a rear-guard action against the cautious policies for change of Prime Minister P.W.

Even with the February upturn, housing starts remained at a level that one industry spokesman called ''terribly depressed'' by the standards of recent years. In January 1981, for example, housing starts were at an annual rate of 1.66 million."

The seriousness with which Mr. Papandreou regarded the military could be seen after his election victory in October, when he kept the Defense Minister's portfolio for himself and paid almost daily visits to the armed forces' headquarters, where he also has an office. Since then he has entrenched his position by replacing the armed forces' leadership and a few dozen other senior officers and by granting military personnel substantial improvements in the conditions of service.   Further, the Socialist leader has made it clear that he no longer intends to pull Greece out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a move that, it is widely believed, would be strongly opposed by the military."

I haven't done this, but I wonder whether it just might show that the productive worker is in reality receiving less per unit of real output, while the enterprise is receiving no more, simply because the nonproductive (read ''government,'' or, if you must, ''public'') sector is drawing more.   This, of course, is not a productivity curve, but it does cast some light on the idea that ''...in the long term the employee's share of gross product remains fairly constant, which seems reasonable.''

The Government's anger was aroused by news that Jagjit Singh Chauhan, the chief spokesman for a movement that advocates a separate homeland for the Sikh religious minority, had been allowed to enter the United States from Canada.   Foreign Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao summoned the United States Ambassador, Harry S. Barnes, last weekend to convey the extreme disappointment of the Indian Government that Mr. Chauhan had been allowed to enter the United States despite an earlier notification by India that his passport was no longer valid. Mr. Rao reportedly expressed surprise that in light of the American Civil War support could be given to an avowed secessionist.   United States officials here and in Washington notified the Indian Government that although Mr. Chauhan's entry had originally been blocked, the objection to his entry was waived on humanitarian grounds because he told United States immigration officials that he was going to Houston for treatment of a heart problem."

Demand of large institutional investors for United States Government and corporate notes was weak, and dealers said the day's price declines resulted largely from speculative activity.   ''Actually, I think the market showed remarkable strength given all the news that one would have expected to cause prices to fall,'' one dealer in the Treasury market said.   Among the developments that analysts said would normally cause lower prices and higher yields in the credit markets were the increase in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to around 13 3/8 percent and Federal Reserve sales of Treasury bills for its own account and that of a customer."

Mexican labor groups have also asserted that the Immigration and Naturalizatio n Service is planning ''mass deportations'' of Mexicans in the United States.   So far, however, both the Reagan and Lopez Portillo administrations have been careful not to let the problem grow into a major crisis.

Ready to Issue Cellular Radio Orders,"  The Federal Communications Commission, after more than 13 years of deliberations and delays, plans to issue final orders as early as this week authorizing a new form of mobile telephone service called cellular radio, according to senior officials in the agency.   The decision to proceed, which was uncertain until last week, ends speculation that the new service may be delayed further by last month's proposed antitrust settlement between the Justice Department and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.   An important provision of the commission's plan to start cellular radio, which was affirmed in December, sets aside half of the business for telephone companies and leaves the rest for other kinds of companies, which will have to compete among themselves for permits to operate their own services. System Improves Voice Quality   In the cellular system, made practical by computer technology, localities are divided into small geographic units, or ''cells,'' each served on a two-way basis by their own receivers and low-power transmitters, using different radio frequencies. Special switching equipment makes it possible for a call made from a moving vehicle to be handed off automatically from cell to cell, from frequency to frequency, without interrupting the conversation. It is designed to provide vastly improved voice quality for small, portable, wireless telephones for home and personal use, as well as in automobiles."

Spokesmen for the State Department and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said they expected the legal certification document to be sent to Congress on Thursday, paving the way for continued United States assistance to El Salvador.   Military and intelligence officials, meanwhile, said that the flow of small arms from Nicaragua to anti-Government forces in El Salvador continued at a steady rate in recent months.   The certification on human rights is required by the Foreign Assistance Act, approved last month. The President must submit documentation within 30 days of the date that the law was enacted, and at six-month intervals for two years, in order for $25 million in military aid and $40 million in econom ic assistance to be sent to the military- civilian junta in El Salvador. But the act does not give Congress the right to challenge the accuracy and validity of thefindings in t he President's certification."

In a reconstruction of events from Dec. 13, when martial law was imposed, to the end of the year, a well-informed Communist Party source said on Jan. 1 that Lech Walesa had been persuaded to make an appeal to Solidarity members on the day of the crackdown to give up open resistance, but that the move was blocked by the Roman Catholic Church.   The church intervened and urged the Government not to press for such an appeal on the ground that this would undercut Mr. Walesa's credibility as a leader and make it difficult for him to play a ''useful'' role in the future, the party source said.

This charge is the keystone of a document that marks the most sophisticated effort yet to persuade public opinion in the United States and Western Europe that the Reagan Administration's arms buildup is a threat to peace.   While Mr. Reagan and his aides have premised increases in the American military budget on the need to counter what they say is a Soviet bid for military superiority, the Soviet booklet declares that it is the United States that seeks ''world dictation.''   ''Soviet military doctrine has been and is based on the principle of retaliatory, that is, defensive actions,'' the booklet says. By contrast, it says, ''the agreed schedule of Pentagon plans for building up strategic offensive armaments and deploying anti-missile and space defense systems is timed to complete the development of a so-called first-strike potential in the 1980's.''"

Page A4. By LESLIE H. GELB Specia l to the New York Times   WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 - The dominant fact of life in the Middle East is Israeli military superiority, and the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin intends to preserve and use that superiority to maintain the political status quo in the region through the 1980's.   Since there is little the Arab nations can do about this situation on the battlefield, they are gearing up to carry their struggle for the Palestinians and the return of remaining occupied territories to Washington. And, for the first time, Arab and Israeli leaders alike see potential vulnerabilities in American support for Israel."

Amid this homey mom-and-pop atmosphere, Mr. Bauer's son runs a small plastics business that supplies parts to such corporate giants as the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Western Electric Company.   To most consumers, plastics are synonymous with chemical monoliths such as the Dow Chemical Company or the Union Carbide Corporation - enormous companies with enormous factories that churn out material found in everything from telephones to dashboards.   Actually, however, the companies responsible for some 60 percent of the nation's 37 billion pounds of plastic production are small shops run by entrepreneurs who often began with nothing more than a vat, a molding machine and an empty garage."

It is a nearly perfect case - one that raises many issues, is filled with uncertainties and for which there are no clear-cut answers.   While the settlement generally wins praise as being in the best long-term interest of AT&T, the business school view is that the transformation of the company from a giant that thrived in a monopoly setting to a mere mortal moving into a tough competitive arena will require changes that strike at its corporate heart.   And how the AT&T case - probably cases, since the settlement raises enough issues to keep many case writers busy -is taught in the nation's business schools could well affect how the next generation of business leaders views the breakup of the largest company in the world.  AT&T recently agreed to give up its local telephone operations to enter such previously prohibited fields as data processing, communications between computers and sales of related equipment."

MacAvoy.  In his ''The Business Lobby's Wrong Business'' (Dec. 20), Professor MacAvoy echoes Professor Friedman's classic declaration that, ''The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits,'' and takes to task the members of the Business Roundtable for their recently published ''Statement on Corporate Responsibility.''   According to Professor MacAvoy, the Roundtable statement is fatally flawed by its implication ''that the large corporation is a political entity ... rather than an economic organization.'' The fact is that Mr. MacAvoy's comments are themselves invalidated by a failure to comprehend the contemporary scene."

Brian Peckford of Newfoundland has called an election next month, two years before the end of his term, to strengthen his position in the province's continuing dispute with the Canadian Government over control of offshore energy resources.   With negotiations broken down for more than a month, Mr. Peckford, who was elected in 1979, said Monday that he would take the issue to an election on April 6 in which he is favored to win. Mr. Peckford said today that he had offered a proposal to the federal Government that contrasts with the settlement Nova Scotia was persuaded to sign two weeks ago.   There is much more at stake than political differences in the Newfoundland dispute, because exploration has turned up proven reserves of some 2 billion barrels of oil, with hopes of more, whereas only gas has been found thus far off Nova Scotia. There is currently a gas surplus in Canada."

Chrysler was the last of the domestic automobile companies to report its financial results for 1981, the second consecutive year of dismal sales and earnings for the once-vibrant industry. Its fourthquarter loss was far less than the $235.1 million that the nation's third-largest auto manufacturer lost in 1980's fourth quarter.   The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company, the American Motors Corporation and Chrsyler reported a combined loss of $1.34 billion, although G.M. earned a slight profit of $333 million.  The losses were far less than in 1980, primarily as a result of costcutting measures rather than an increase in car sales. All four companies reported losses for 1980, and these totaled more than $4 billion."

Among the biggest targets were the natural resource companies and in the culmination of a decade-long infatuation with minerals, the pursuers, for the most part, were oil companies.   In little more than a week's time last year, Standard Oil of California offered $4 billion for Amax, in vain it turned out, and Standard Oil of Ohio handed over $1.8 billion for Kennecott. In other notable battles, Du Pont outbid Mobil and the Seagram Company for Conoco, and U.S. Steel picked up Marathon Oil with Mobil, again, the loser. Seagram, awash with cash with the proceeds from its sale of Texas oil and gas properties, offered $2 billion plus for St. Joe Minerals but lost again, this time to the Fluor Corporation.   Were all those billions worth it? For Du Pont and U.S. Steel, the answer awaits further developments of the great oil glut. But in the other big arena of natural resource acquisitions - metals - the oil company acquirers would have done better by buying more oil or shares in a money fund. Oil, over the last eight years, has proven a handsome investment, delivering a 17 percent annual rate of return on shareholders equity while minerals have averaged only a little more than half that. And last year, mining was, at best, only marginally profitable."

''The amount of cash they're getting from James River, added to the amount they would get should they sell their timberlands, should give them around $600 million to $700 million. This would allow them to get into the financial services business in a meaningful manner.''"

The rival, Dr. Andries P. Treurnicht, entered a hall belonging to a wing of the Dutch Reformed Church here this morning as leader of the National Party in the country's wealthiest and most populace province, the Transvaal. When he emerged six hours later, he had been stripped of his membership in the party's executive committee and politically humiliated on a motion of confidence that affirmed Mr.  Botha's right to interpret party policy on key racial issues.   The vote on the motion was lopsided, 172 to 36, and it meant that the party machinery in the crucial province had been wrested from Dr. Treurnicht's control. The Prime Minister has given dissident party members until Wednesday to reverse their stand on the confidence motion taken here today and in the parliamentary caucus two days ago. If they fail to do so, they will be expelled from the party."

Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Begin presented an array of statistics on what he called ''the mighty, almost unimaginable flow of sophisticated weaponry reaching the Arab states from both the East and the West.'' This arms buildup, he contended, jeopardizes Israel's qualitative military edge over the Arabs, which President Reagan has pledged to maintain.   Parliament then approved, by a vote of 88 to 3, with 6 abstentions, a resolution expressing ''deep concern'' over Mr. Weinberger's proposal, which, it said, ''poses a serious danger to Israel's security.''

Liquor and cigarette producers argue that raising taxes on their goods would dampen sales, in some cases severely enough to offset the revenues gained from the higher levy. As for oil refiners, they say that a rise in the excise tax on gasoline would accelerate the trend toward conservation but would have little or no immediate effect on sales.   The outlook remains unclear. The Senate majority leader, Howard H.  Baker Jr., says it seems unlikely that President Reagan will accept his recommendation for raising some excise taxes. (Page D3.)"

The Austrians intend to use the loans to raise their exports to the Soviet Union, shrinking their increasing trade deficits with Moscow.

After years of spectacular growth, 1981 and the first quarter of 1982 proved a rude awakening for many of the best-known names in technology-related industries, and there are no immediate prospects of a sudden turnaround.   ''The small companies that developed a product to fit a particular niche generally did well, but the more broad-based, undifferentiated ones really had their problems,'' said Mark Jordan, a special-situations analyst for the Houston-based brokerage firm of Rotan Mosle.   Yet, most observers see a bright future for the Texas electronics industry, which is based in the Dallas-Fort Worth area called the ''Silicon Prairie'' and has outposts in Austin and San Antonio. A study by the University of Texas anticipates that sales for the industry within the state by 1990 will quadruple its 1978 level, outpacing the nationwide growth.

This acknowledgment, which is reflected in reports of preliminary forecast figures and in interviews with Administration officials, illustrates the monetarist influence in top circles of the Administration. But it has created problems for the Administration by forcing it to face traditional economic strictures rather than standing pat with what many economists think are the unrealistic tenets of the Administration's supply-side economics.   The recognition that monetary policy imposes a ceiling helped unravel the President's earlier promise of a balanced budget by 1984. It also has forced the Administration to face up to a string of record budget deficits in the future and threatens its hopes for strong economic growth after the recession."

Although lower yields and increased prices for notes and bonds are often a sign of increased investor demand, many credit market participants said that yesterday's drop was engineered by traders and speculators and was not based on an inflow of orders from institutional buyers, such as pension funds, banks, insurance companies and investment advisory concerns.   ''At 14 7/8 percent, or even 14 3/4 percent, we would have had a lot of orders for the three-year note,'' said one dealer in Government securities, ''but at these lower yields, I have to assume the issue was bought on emotion by traders and speculators.'' Popularity Cited   William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at the Bank of NewYork, said th at the $1.353 billion of noncompetitive purchases for the three-yea r issue showed its popularity among individuals and smaller insti tutions. Even so, he added that ''the Street pushed the market to the point where lower yields eliminated a lot of interest by institutio ns.''"

Casey, director of Central Intelligence, resulted from the intelligence community's concern over the public disclosures of secret contacts with Iranian officials and of detailed American assessments of the Iranian situation that followed the takeover.

The $52 million renovation by the Teitelbaum Group, a consortium headed by David M. Teitelbaum, will convert the empty 10-story building at Christopher and Washington Streets into a mixed-use structure combining space for retail shops and areas for community groups on the lower floors with space on the upper floors for 354 cooperative apartments.   The landmark Federal building has several imposing features: its size and dominating block-square bulk; its total interior space of 670,000 square feet, which is about an acre a floor, and its redbrick facade, done in the 19th-century Romanesque revival style that evokes a mixture of romanticism and practicality.   But now the most important fact about the building is its own future -and the effect its redevelopment will have on the changing western edge of Greenwich Village."

According to these officials, Defense Secretary Caspar W.  Weinberger made clear his view that if sanctions against the Soviet Union over the situation in Poland were to have any credibility, the allies would have to be told firmly that the United States would oppose the use by European companies of licenses from American concerns to produce components for the pipeline.   Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. was reported to have stressed that although the pipeline was contrary to Western interests, it would be counterproductive to try to block it now. He was said to have counseled that it was more important to prevent an open rift in the Western alliance than to take strong action over the pipeline project."

While acknowledging that a rebound of sorts did occur last month, some analysts say the underlying fundamentals remain unchanged, and that the current recession is still dangerously close to turning into something far worse.   Upcoming reports on retail sales and industrial production, to name two, are likely to show improvement from depressed January levels.  Unemployment rose last month, but remains below 9 percent. And positive oil price developments could give a short-term lift to some beleagured industries, notably the commercial airlines."

The Chrysler Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation reported today that they had sold 16,841 cars daily in the nine selling days of the period, compared with 24,460 a day in the eight selling days of the comparable 1981 period. 'Mostly the Recession'   David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burhham Lambert Inc., attributed the poor sales to the recession, high interest rates and high car price - ''mostly the recession.''   All five major auto makers, including Volskwagen and American Motors, had rebate programs in effect during the period, but they appeared to have had little impact on sales."

The high yield for the bonds - up from only 13.9 percent a week ago and 12 3/4 percent in late November -seemed to confirm Wall Street warnings that large budget deficits push up interest rates. Early last November, the Treasury sold similar bonds at a 14.10 percent yield, but since then budget deficit estimates for the fiscal years 1983 and 1984 have expanded sharply.   Despite this, Treasury officials had little choice but to crowd into the credit markets this week with $20 billion of short- and long-term issues that raised about $6.7 billion of new cash. Treasury officials estimated last week that they needed to raise $41.25 billion of new cash this quarter to cover a fiscal 1982 deficit estimated by private analysts and some Government officials at $100 million."

Although both the church and the state appealed for unity, the conditions they set augured the opposite.   Presiding stiffly over a surprisingly tame session of the Communist Party's Central Committee and displaying similar control at a subsequent session of the country's Parliament, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski demonstrated that the reins of party and Government were firmly in his grasp, that the free-wheeling political debates of the previous year were over.   He heard solid support for martial law and for his promise of continued severity against violators; he heard only denunciations of Solidarity and the ''extremists'' who he said hijacked its leadership, and he found no disagreement with his program of ''national reconciliation'' along lines that would effectively exclude the indepdendent labor union Solidarity in the shape it had before military rule."

The forecasters said corporate profit margins in the first quarter were being squeezed much tighter than earlier anticipated, as a result of lower productivity, high interest rates, dwindling sales volumes and product prices that are slipping faster than manufacturing costs. The auto, oil and housing industries are expected to lead the earnings retreat, dragging other sectors of the economy closely behind.   ''What is most disconcerting,'' said Gail I. Hessol, vice president for industrial ratings at Standard & Poor's Corporation, ''is that just about any of the industries or companies we deal with have business forecasts that assume a recovery for the second half of 1982. But when we press them, they admit their orders have not picked up this quarter. If there is to be a recovery, they should be receiving the orders by now. I think many of them are quietly reassessing their plans.''"

There was skepticism because Mr. Rumsfeld had no corporate business experience, whatever the number of top Government posts he had held, and he was also an outsider - the first non-Searle to head the company in its 90-year history.   ''He's tough-minded,'' said Arthur M. Wood, a Searle director and former chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company. ''Searle knew that it would be taking some risks in bringing him on.''   The doubts about Mr. Rumsfeld have long since dissipated and employees have little to fear for now. Searle's earnings on continuing op erations have climbed an average of 17 percent a year, and Searle re ported last week that 1981 earnings on continuing operations ju mped 29 percent, to $130.9 million, on sales of $942.3 million (alth ough an accounting adjustment and losses from discontinued operation dropped the net to $98.7 million)."

Professor Tobin said the Fed could relax its monetary stance without rekindling inflation if its action were coupled with measures to reduce Federal deficits.   He proposed eliminating a 10 percent cut in tax rates scheduled for July 1983, reducing defense spending plans by $10 billion a year, imposing $10 billion in ''windfall profits'' taxes from a decontrol of natural gas prices and raising another $10 billion by closing unspecified tax loopholes."

It announced plans to close three plants indefinitely in March, including its Chevrolet and Cadillac plant here, and throw another 7,000 employees out of work.   The breakdown in talks and the subsequent layoffs caught many labor relations specialists off guard. General Motors had won high marks for improving morale and productivity on the factory floor since the last big recession in 1974. Its worker participation programs, which in general give employees more responsibility on the assembly line, have been widely copied.   Moreover, many management specialists had pointed to G.M. as an example of how a large American manufacturer is meeting Japanese competition by reducing labor tensions and improving products."

Haig Jr.'s testimony today before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as recorded by The New York Times:   Vietnam-Salvador Parallel   I think much has been done to suggest there are strong parallels between the American approach today to Salvador and to Vietnam some years ago. I think this is a terrible distortion of reality and one which overlooks a number of fundamental differences.   First and foremost is the difference with respect to the strategic importance of Central America as a region and the member republics of the region to the United States today. That region is our fourth largest trading partner; one-half of our oil moves through the waters of the Caribbean and the canal. Roughly one-half of our global trade goes through that region. As a nation, we've been plagued recently to the tune of one and a half million undocumented illegal entries to the United States in 1980. All of this underlines the strategic importance of the Central America region. From the standpoint of military capability, at a time of conflict, it would control the flow of our logistic support for our half a million Americans positioned forward in Europe to maintain the defense of those assets, let alone the importance of our ability to defend Western Europe at large."

In a season of subtle but significant changes in the tenor of British politics, Mrs. Thatcher and her resolutely cautious policies no longer seem quite so embattled. This week a London bookmaker went so far as to install her Conservative Party as a narrow favorite to win the election, which is expected in the spring of 1984.   The most important development has been a slowing of the momentum of the new Social Democratic Party, which burst upon the British political scene just a year ago with tremendous force, and which won its most notable victory late last year when Shirley Williams captured the previously Conservative seat at Crosby, near Liverpool, in a by-election."

Iran cut a dollar from its price on Feb. 5 but failed to attract customers.

They also believe that 1982 may lay the foundations for a major decline in the dollar's value if, as some forecasters expect, the United States begins to record large international payments deficits while West Germany and Japan resume posting their traditional surplusses.   Whether this drop develops depends on several unknowns, including the depth of the economic slowdown in the United States, events in Poland and whether American interest rates turn sharply higher again as the economy recovers.   Between October 1980 and last August, the American dollar reversed almost 10 years of steady decline in value against other major currencies, rising some 30 percent against the German mark and by 13 percent against the Japanese yen, according to calculations by the Morgan Guaranty Trust."

Brown, chairman of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said yesterday that the Bell System would be able to reduce its planned external financing needs by at least $500 million during 1982 because of the weakening economy and the resulting drop in demand for new telecommunications construction.   Speaking to an overflow gathering of the New York Society of Security Analysts, Mr. Brown also announced that for the first time in A.T.& T.'s history, it would turn to the Eurobond market to raise$400 million in seven-year debt securities to meet part of its total capital requirements for the coming year.   In discussing the upcoming divestiture of A.T.& T.'s 22 operating subsidiaries, as a result of the settlement with the Justice Department of its antitrust suit, Mr. Brown reiterated the company's commitment to spinning off the local telephone companies in sound financial condition.   He said A.T.& T. plans to provide funding so that the operating companies ''will be able to avoid new issues of long-term debt between now and their divestiture.'' Moreover, A.T.& T. will assume existing debt obligations of local operating companies, if necessary, to preserve their credit worthiness, he said."

The sources added that Mr. Castro was pleased by his meeting with General Walters, who is a former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, and was hopeful that it would be followed by further negotiations with the Reagan Administration. Cuba Prefers Wide Talks   ''The Cubans say that no arms have gone from Cuba to El Salvador for the past 14 months, but they can't assume an obligation to stop aiding the guerrillas if this problem is seen in isolation,'' a knowledgeable Western diplomat said. ''They argue that the situation would be different if the United States stopped arming the Salvadoran junta or peace talks began in El Salvador.''"

Short-term, it is obviously in a recession that started last fall; but this is the second recession since 1980, the third since 1975, and many economists believe that, even if recovery begins in the second half of this year, a fourth recession is just around the corner. It's been a long sequence of recessions and weak, aborted expansions.   Is this, then, a depression we are in? Looking backward, the term seems too strong. The economy has been stagnating, not collapsing. If the roof were to fall in later this year, or next, it could become a depression, but the odds are still against it.   Call it repression - a chronic state of underemployment and industrial slack that has dogged the economy for the greater part of the past decade, a condition brought on by repressive actions of governments in the industrial world to cope with inflation, energy shortages and currency disorders."

To an emotional congregation in the Church of St. Stanislaus in downtown Rome that filled every available space inside and in the courtyard, the head of the Polish hierarchy said:   ''We are confident that, with God's help, we will be able to explain to ourselves the reasons for our anger, in a dialogue, and not by force. Poland must not become an arena of bloody confrontation. No one must be allowed to manipulate our wrath, because the people want to shed this illness of rage all by itself, and emerge all in one, and healed.''"

As the Soviet occupation enters its 27th month, Moscow appears to be combining the tougher retaliatory policy with an extension of its economic ties with the Government of President Babrak Karmal.   Leaders of insurgent organizations in Pakistan, the land to which two and a half million Afghan refugees have fled since the Soviet Union intervened in late December 1979, continue to report gains against the Soviet forces, which are now estimated to number 90,000.  But the Soviet retaliations have been fierce."

Back in August of 1977, the United States Ambassador to Tokyo, Mike Mansfield, warned Japan that the $5 billion American trade deficit with Japan the previous year was a ''disturbing figure'' and ''provides much ammunition to the advocates of protectionism in the United States.''   In 1978, this message came from James R. Jones, Democrat of Oklahoma: ''The time for negotiations has long passed...unless the trade imbalance is substantially reversed in the next several months, there will be protective measures added to a number of legislative items in 1979.''"

Ever since the President made the charge and threatened to deport those found guilty of hoarding or smuggling currency, some Government officials have been privately trying to assure Kenya's Asians, who are mainly of Indian and Pakistani background, that they will not encounter discrimination.   But leading Asians here say the President's statements, made in a speech Feb. 6 to a group of municipal officials, added to Asian feelings of insecurity that were growing before he spoke. Some say one result could be a quickening of Asian emigration and of the flight of Asian capital."

The fund, after all, is the major source of outside financing for an area that A.W. Clausen, president of the I.M.F.'s sister organization, the World Bank, has described as ''by far the poorest part of the world's economy.''   Opposition to the fund - and, by habits of thought in this area, to the United States, holder of the largest voting block in the fund - centers on charges of imperialism. More particularly, it comes in reaction to the increasing readiness among multilateral and bilateral aid donors to take African governments to task over their economic performance. It is a trend that seems reinforced by the Reagan Administration's stress on the ''conditionality'' of development assistance."

Worldwide sales of skis decreased by 13 percent in the 1980-81 season, and the drop was centered in the United States and Canada.   Consequently, Rossignol is in trouble. Not terminal trouble, according to its president and founder, Laurent Boix Vives, but trouble enough to put the company in a serious bind for at least another year - even if this winter, at last, there's a surfeit of snow in some areas.

The only comparable figure over the last 36 years is Wladyslaw Gomulka, the party leader who rose to power as a reformer in 1956 and who was dismissed, an embittered conservative, after workers' riots in 1970. Mr. Gomulka, who is now terminally ill, was praised as ''a great son of the Polish nation, an ardent internationalist and a Communist'' in an editorial today in Trybuna Ludu, the main Communist Party newspaper. The occasion was the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Polish Workers' Party, the predecessor of today's Polish United Workers' (Communist) Party."

Early this month, in a few sentences tucked into the middle of the 108-minute budget address by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Conservative Thatcher Government in effect buried that ''monetarist'' strategy. Henceforth, Sir Geoffrey said, a variety of monetary statistics would be monitored within broad target bands.   Similarly, Mrs. Thatcher early on moved to ease the burden of income taxes to encourage savings and investment, a change consistent with what became known in the United States as supply- side economics. But she also raised taxes on consumption. Partly as a result of this, and the Government's monetary policy, the inflation rate jumped to nearly 23 percent and the practices of supply-side economics have receded."

Without comment, the Court turned down an appeal by the Johns-Manville Corporation and other manufacturers of asbestos products from a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond. That court allowed five former workers at the Newport News shipyards, who had been exposed to asbestos on the job as long as 42 years ago, to maintain their suit against the company in Federal court.   Had the court of appeals accepted the companies' argument that there was no basis for Federal jurisdiction and the case therefore belonged in state court, the workers' suit would almost certainly have been dismissed under the Virginia statute of limitations. Like many states, Virginia requires that lawsuits be filed within two years of exposure to a harmful substance."

If that holds true this time, it seems abundantly clear that energy, technology and precious-metal issues, which once served as inflationhedge favorites, are not destined to lead the ultimate parade to higher prices.   Food-processing stocks, on the other hand, have been performing uncommonly well, along with such sectors as soap and electric utilities. These groups represent the sort of defensive investments that people often make in times of extreme market conservatism. In fact, on the theory that the best offense is a good defense, some analysts expect food securities to continue to perform well in the next market cycle."

''The employment picture has not been so poor since the first few months of 1975, which was the end of a major recession,'' he added.  However, he noted that the December rate of decline for the orders, production and employment indicators was not so steep as those of the previous few months."

It briefly had that title after it acquired Campbell-Mithun in 1979 only to lose it to the Interpublic Group of Companies, which earlier had won it by acquiring Campbell-Ewald in 1972 then rewon it by buying SSC&B and part of the worldwide Lintas operation.   Earlier this month the William Esty Company, the 16th-largest American agency, announced that it had merged with Ted Bates for the ''largest merger'' in history. Actually it was an acquisition, and since both are privately held companies, one cannot verify their numbers. Bates is reporting 1981 billings of $1.4 billion, which, of course, has nothing to do with the acquisition size. But Esty's size does, and it announced that its billings for the year were $575 million."

Short-term interest rates rose sharply after the Fed's announcement, as traders quickly decided that the Fed had little choice now but to combat excessive money supply growth by making credit scarcer in the banking system, thereby driving up interest rates.   Some economists were more circumspect, however. They said the recent increases in short-term rates were evidence that the Fed was ''leaning'' against rapid money supply growth without yet undertaking an outright tightening of monetary policy that would send interest rates higher during a recession, possibly endangering a recovery."

The watchwords, taxexperts stress, are ''be sure you can prove i t.''   The rules about tax-deductible entertaining were little affected by former President Carter's famous attacks on the ''three-martini lunch'' and left unchanged by last year's tax act. But a revenue-hungry Government is sharpening its collection process, the cost of underpaying taxes is soaring, and last week, the Internal Revenue Service said it would soon be auditing twice as many returns as it has in recent years. While three years is the normal limit for an audit, the I.R.S. can go further back in some cases - and it recommends that you keep your records for at least six years.   ''Substantiation, is the biggest problem with deducting entertainment,'' said Barbara Weltman, an attorney who helps compile ''J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax,'' an annual tax manual."

In recent weeks the Government has taken important steps on several fronts, including increased cooperation with Dublin and new efforts to bring together the various political factions in the province. On Wednesday, announcing an 8 percent increase in the planned level of public spending there, James Prior, the British Cabinet minister responsible for the province, said the increase demonstrated the Government's commitment to Northern Ireland, and he added pointedly:   ''I hope this will be reflected in the cooperation that the Government receives in seeking to bring about greater stability, and in the long-term political responsibility.'' A Show of Displeasure   But the problem of reconciliation that Mr. Prior faces was reflected in the fact that just two weeks ago, when he invited the province's Members of Parliament in for a meeting to discuss the new economic package in advance, most of them stayed away, in a show of displeasure with the Government."

Nicaragua has accused Honduras and the United States of promoting a separatist movement among Nicaraguan Miskitos and encouraging armed bands of Nicaraguan exiles to make incursions.   In response, Nicaraguan troops have removed 8,000 to 10,000 Indians from border areas. In announcing the arrest of 100 dissident Miskitos on Feb. 3, the Managua Government said 60 Nicaraguan soldiers and Miskitos had been killed by rightist exiles in recent weeks."

As a result, the 10-nation community, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, is unlikely to be able to present a cohesive view on world economic problems when the leaders of its four biggest members, West Germany, France, Britain and Italy, meet with President Reagan and the Prime Ministers of Canada and Japan at the Western economic meeting in Versailles, France, next June.   Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany and Britain's Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, both took a firm stand against mounting pressure from the Common Market's Executive Commission and several smaller governments to move to policies intended to stimulate economic growth. These policies, which include higher government spending, would be aimed at bringing down Europe's soaring unemployment rate."

Beginning quietly in the early 1970's, the area's growing technology complex has helped to transform the economic profile of Long Island and the developments are on the verge of moving into New York City itself.   In just in the last six years, hundreds of small- to medium-size companies engaged in highly sophisticated scientific research and manufacturing have cropped up on Long Island, from the New York City line almost to Riverhead. No one, not even economic-development specialists, is sure how many enterprises there are because no two people have the same definition of high technology. But no one disputes that companies engaged in avionics, semiconductors, microcircuitry and other ventures on the cutting edge of new technology have found a home in Nassau and Suffolk Counties."

But new provisions in the law double the amount of di vidend income that i nvestors can exclude on their 1981 returns, and allow people to she lter their interest income in two new ways. The general rule is that taxpayers must include all payments for services rendered, including such items as severance pay, union strike benefits and under-the-t able commissio ns. Gambling victories must be reported (losses can be deducted as a n itemized deduction, but only up to the amount of winnings), and s o must illegal income such as embezzled funds. Alimony and separate maintenance payments are considered income, but child support paym ents are not.   Taxpayers must also list a certain portion of their income from investments, such as stock dividends or interest on bank savings accounts. The amount and type of investment income that can be excluded this year has been liberalized as a result of the 1980 Windfall Profit Tax Act."

Last year the courts approved deductions for everything fr om hair transplants for a prematurely bald man to the cost of whisk y prescribed by a doctor to relieve angina pain. A wide variety of medical expenses, ranging from vitamin pills prescribed by a doctor to prosthetic devices for patients recovering from mastectomy, are deductible as long as the cost exceeds a certain level. The rule is that an individual can claim only those expenses that exceed a ''floor'' for total medical expenses of 3 percent of his or her adjusted gross income.   But half of all medical insurance premiums, up to a maximum of $150, can be deducted regardless of whether the taxpayer qualifies for other medical deductions. (The other half is treated as an ordinary medical expense and is subject to the 3 percent floor.) Medicine and drugs are also deductible, but before they can be added to other medical bills subject to the 3 percent floor they must first be reduced by 1 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income."

To make his meaning quite clear, the Pope used the Polish word ''Solidarnosc'' five times in his New Year's address, even though the rest of it was in Italian.   As he spoke from the window of his apartment, young people in St.  Peter's Square held up huge banners with the words ''Solidarity'' in both Polish and Italian; others, some standing on the shoulders of their companions, waved dozens of large gold and white Polish flags.  The Pope was interrupted by fervent applause several times from the crowd of about 50,000."

Yet several funds, some new and some older, have an interesting twist: They are structured to minimize taxes by reinvesting income and by never paying dividends.

The funds are completely different from those that specialize in taxexempt municipal bonds except that they share a common goal of reducing taxes."

Responding to the Bendix announcment, trading in RCA stock soared to 1.3 million shares, ending the day at $20, ahead only 62 1/2 cents. If Bendix, which has not identified the period during which it bought RCA stock, were to have acquired its shares at yesterday's closing price, the stake would be worth about $75.4 million.

A number of bankers and economists said that the small decline indicated that the Federal Reserve would continue to keep a tight rein on the money supply and that, as a result, short-term interest rates would not decline despite new evidence of a deepening recession.   ''My best guess for the immediate future is that short-term rates will be flat,'' said Jay N. Woodworth, vice president and economist of the Bankers Trust Company. ''Considering the economy, these rates should be expected to fall.'' Mr. Woodworth and most other economists cited the Government's report yesterday that the unemployment rate jumped to 8.9 percent in December on an annual basis, up from 8.4 percent in November."

But according to accounts by Administration officials and Latin American diplomats, there is far less going on than meets the eye, at least for the moment.   On the surface, it looks like all of the parties are preparing for serious bargaining: revelations of a high-ranking Administration emissary meeting secretly with Fidel Castro in Cuba last week, a Nicaraguan leader saying today that his Government and Cuba would negotiate immediately with Washington, the American Ambassador to El Salvador on Wednesday underlining the Administration's willingness to see direct negotiations commence between the new government there and the Salvadoran guerrillas, the Venezuelan President speaking on the same day of rethinking policy toward El Salvador after Sunday's elections, and more. A Willingness to Negotiate   With all of this diplomatic pressure and activity, and with growing domestic opposition to the Reagan Administration policy toward Central America, the speculation was bound to grow that President Reagan had to be looking for a way out. And under the circumstances, no one could exclude the possibility that all this may be the necessary posturing that often precedes serious negotiations."

If terminated, the 88 West Coast utilities participating in the two projects - No.4 and No.5 of the Washington Public Power Supply System -may be left having to repay some $2.25 billion in principal payments and some $4.75 billion in interest with no power plants to generate either electricity or revenues."

Two years ago, when the agency was investigating television advertising directed at children, Congress prohibited the F.T.C.  from issuing any industrywide rules on fairness in advertising.  However, it permitted the agency to continue scrutinizing the fairness of individual advertisements.   Under this authorization, the agency has reviewed such commercials as those showing children in potentially dangerous situations that the agency felt might be imitated by young viewers. In one case, for example, the agency objected to a proposed TV commercial that showed a child using an electrical appliance near water without adult supervision. The commercial was dropped."

WINS ON TAX STRADDLES,"  The Internal Revenue Service has won a legal battle to prohibit the use of commodity futures straddles to postpone tax liabilities, but the victory appears to be largely symbolic because the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 banned the use of commodity tax straddles anyway.   The United States Tax Court, upholding the position that the I.R.S. has taken since 1977, ruled Monday that commodity tax staddles were solely devices to avoid paying taxes, rather than business deals aimed at making profits, and prohibited the use of paper losses on such transactions as tax deductions.   A typical tax straddle today would involve, say, the purchase of a 1982 silver futures contract and the simultaneous sale of a 1983 contract. If prices dropped, then losses on the current year's futures would be applied against taxes due by April 15, 1983, while the gains on the futures that were sold short would square the straddlers' accounts with their brokers. Also, the gain on the 1983 futures could be offset by another straddle."

The declines, compared with the last quarter of 1980, ranged from 4.5 percent at Standard of Indiana to 20.5 percent at Exxon.  However, Exxon's figures reflected a large accounting loss because of currency transactions.   ''The figures are telling you that the refining business is still under pressure, especially overseas,'' said Constantine Fliakos, an industry analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. In most refining markets, demand from retailers of petroleum products or industrial users remains too weak for the companies to raise their prices or to operate refineries at volumes high enough for real efficiency."

They say this lapse caused new personal tensions within his triumvirate of senior advisers.   Edwin Meese 3d, the White House counselor, said today that he was the only adviser among the Big Three who knew more than one or two days ahead of time that the Justice and Treasury Departments planned to end the Government's 11-year ban on tax exemptions for private schools that practice racial discrimination.   Other White House officials said that Mr. Meese's two colleagues, James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, and Michael K.  Deaver, the deputy chief of staff, were angry that he did not warn them about the policy change that produced last week's controversy over the Administration's racial attitudes.   Mr. Meese said in an interview that Treasury officials told him Dec. 28 that they and officials of the Justice Department wanted to abandon the Federal court-ordered ban on such exemptions. But Mr.  Baker did not find out until the night of Jan. 6 that the Justice and Treasury officials planned to announce the new policy Jan. 8."

Citicorp, for example, the nation's second-biggest bank holding company, reported that its income before securities transactions rose 126 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 1980, while earnings of the BankAmerica Corporation, the largest, plunged 47.4 percent.   In general, banks in New York and Chicago reported sharp upswings in their fourth-quarter earnings, while those on the West Coast showed declines.   Much depended on how individual banks were poised to take advantage of the decline in interest rates during the fourth quarter. For example, at times during the quarter, the prime lending rate on which banks base the interest charged to customers was as much as four percentage points higher than the interest rate paid on big certificates of deposit."

He is manager of the International Natural Rubber Organization's buffer stock, and thousands of the world's rubber producers rely on him to keep international rubber prices from getting out of hand.   The ''blue line'' that Mr. Reidl defends is the price below which the world's rubber producers begin to suffer the effects of overproduction. At those levels, small-scale rubber growers, whom the rubber organization was established to protect, cannot make a living by tapping their rubber trees."

Brezhnev today proposed a two-thirds cut in United States and Soviet arsenals of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe by 1990.   The Soviet leader coupled the proposal with an attack on the United States policy of linking progress on arms control to other issues, such as the military takeover in Poland.   ''It is madness for any country to build its policy with an eye to nuclear war,'' he said, charging that the United States was avoiding serious negotiations on medium-range weapons and was using ''various far-fetched pretexts'' to put off the resumption of talks on strategic, or intercontinental, nuclear arms.  Elaboration of November Offer   Mr. Brezhnev's proposal for a two-thirds cut in medium-range weapons was an elaboration of a plan he put forward during a visit to Bonn in November. On that occasion, he offered to reduce Soviet forces by ''hundreds of units'' if the United States did the same."

In a break with precedent, the report, issued by the Government's Central Statistical Administration, omitted altogether the size of last year's grain harvest, suggesting that the figure is so low as to be politically embarrassing.   The report merely said that farmers had struggled with ''extremely unfavorable conditions'' and that ''state resources of grain will insure a full supply of bread and bread products.'' Crisis Over Poland May Be Factor   Among explanations put forward by Western diplomats for the omission of the grain figures was a reluctance to give the United States a propaganda lever at a time of tension, particularly in view of the threat of a new grain embargo in retaliation for Moscow's purported role in Poland's military crackdown."

Other Administration officials, led by Secretary of State Alexander M.

Hinton of the United States told a gathering of Salvadoran business executives recently that there had been ''serious excesses'' in human rights abuses in their country. And a report he sent to Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. noted that Government soldiers were responsible for most of the unexplained killings here.   Nonetheless, President Reagan has ''certified'' that the Salvadoran Government has made significant progress in reducing human rights violations - a certification necessary to the continuance of American aid.   The President's certification Jan. 28 would appear to contradict Ambassador Hinton's public declarations and his embassy's report. But most embassy officials defend the President's action, in part because they say there are some indications of a decline in the violence.  They have also disparaged El Salvador's human rights organizations, whose statistics paint a much bleaker picture of the human rights situation than do the embassy's."

But it cropped up just before the white Parliament opened in January in a signed article by Ton Vosloo, editor of an Afrikaanslanguage daily called Beeld. That was a sure sign the vague and sometimes contradictory hints Prime Minister P.W. Botha had been dropping for several years about his plans for change were starting to wear thin with those who had taken them most seriously.   Mr. Vosloo, a 44-year-old former political reporter, is widely held to be running the most vigorous and influential Afrikaans paper in the country. One result is that no South African journalist is thought to have readier access to the Prime Minister. A politician with a notoriously short fuse, Mr. Botha makes sure the communication is not one-way. When he is displeased, Mr. Vosloo gets the message promptly and directly by phone."

Even so, investment bankers are beating a path to Conrail's door, vying for a piece of business - the Government's sale of Conrail - that could bring some of the highest fees in the history of Wall Street.   ''All of a sudden, investment bankers have been written into a good deal,'' said John M. Fowler, general counsel of the Department of Transportation. ''We have to sell Conrail and we couldn't do so without paying an investment banking house an enormous amount of money.''   Those fees could easily run up to $20 million, according to Mr.  Fowler. That amount, however, is still below the fees that individual investment houses cleared for such celebrated deals as the United States Steel-Marathon merger or the Du Pont-Conoco union. The Conrail fees would come from the proceeds of the sale and would, in effect, be paid by the buyer of Conrail, not by the United States Treasury."

Previously, such leases were prohibited if they were undertaken solely to gain some tax advantage. Now they can be freely used as a device for selling tax deductions and investment tax credits whenever a company making a new investment acquires more deductions and credits than it can use against operating profits.  Some free-market conservatives see leasing as a form of welfare for the corporate sector. Alan Greenspan has been quoted as saying that leasing is ''sort of the equivalent of food stamps for undernourished corporations.'' Liberals see it as providing one more tax loophole for rich capitalists. As the need for more and more tax revenues becomes apparent, it is safe to predict that leasing will come under constant attack."

RAIL POLICY MAY AID LARGE CARRIERS,"  The Interstate Commerce Commission, as part of its program to eliminate unnecessary regulations and increase competition, today dropped a 30-year policy of protecting competing railroads from the marketing strategies of merged railroads, the agency said.   Reese H. Taylor Jr., chairman of the commission, said that the policy change, which has emerged after two years of work, ''means that consolidating railroads for the first time will be in a position to pass along to their customers more of the benefits made possible by mergers.''   The new policy, which puts an end to formulas for distributing business, applies to past mergers, including the huge Conrail system, as well as proposed mergers, Mr. Taylor said. Transportation analysts see the changes as a significant benefit to many large rail carriers and a sharp setback to smaller ones that depend on connecting traffic."

Then the Interstate Commerce Commission, over the objections of established carriers, allowed Polar to haul freight for three more companies, giving it a total of nine, on routes mostly on the East Coast. In doing so, however, it warned Polar that as a carrier restricted to serving only certain shippers it had reached the limit of its authority.   ''It was an unwritten rule, when you got up to seven or eight contracts, you generally got no more than that,'' said Mr. Cotta, a short energetic man with a ready smile.   But all that has changed. With the passage of a law in 1980 bringing partial deregulation to the trucking industry, Polar and other companies like it now have much more freedom to expand operations. Indeed, since the signing of the Motor Carrier Act, the I.C.C. says it has approved 91 percent of all applications for broader operating authority."

Speculative buying by traders continued to fuel higher prices for other note and bond issues, while lower overnight interest rates were the most important reason for lower short-term rates.   By late in the day, the Treasury's three-month bills closed at 11.97 percent, down from 12.27 percent Tuesday, while the 14 percent Treasury bonds due in 2011 closed at 102 7/8 to yield 13.6 percent, up three-fourths of a point."

Even as interest rates have declined for big corporations and financial institutions over the past half year, rates have been rising for consumers. Just last week, for example, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company announced that the interest rate on its credit card loans would rise by 10 percent, to 19.8 percent from 18 percent, effective March 1.   Over all, the effective cost of most consumer-banking services is being shifted from those who maintain large deposit balances to people with smaller accounts, who bankers contend have not paid the full cost of service. And some bankers are questioning whether individuals with only a few hundred dollars of savings belong in the banking system at all."

The effort, which has relied heavily on the use of intelligence information, has produced mixed results. Until Friday, officials thought they were making significant headway. Some members of Congress, including several influential committee chairmen, came away from private intelligence briefings saying they were convinced that the Administration had strong evidence to support its charges of Soviet and Cuban involvement in Central America and of Nicaraguan aid to guerrillas in El Salvador.   The public was given a glimpse of the intelligence material when the Administration made public aerial reconnaissance photographs in an effort to show that Nicaragua, with Cuban and Soviet assistance, was assembling the largest military force in Central America."

The lure of interest rates of around 8 percent for borrowings due in less than a year compared with rates of 12 percent or more for bonds due in 20 or 30 years has overpowered officials' worry that if the short-term rates should rise, their budgets would be badly strained by the higher interest payments needed to renew the loans.   ''The increasing use of short-term borrowing is understandable, but it can very quickly turn into an abuse,'' said Freda Ackerman, director of municipal bond rating at Moody's Investors Service. New York's Crisis Recalled   The tax-exempt bond market still bears the scars of the 1975-76 New York City financial crisis. That was precipitated by the city's inability to continue renewing its short-term notes, which totaled $4.5 billion by mid-1975. In the 1960's and early 1970's, short-term borrowing grew rapidly, but contracted sharply after the city's crisis."

Architecturally, it is even more magnificent inside, a six-story well that is surrounded by columned balconies and topped by a Tiffany dome.   But like State Street itself, Marshall Field has long ceased to be the important fashion center of the city, and its balance sheet - tarnished with money-losing acquisitions and debt -has similarly lost its luster. Thus when Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier, acquired 29 percent of its stock, Marshall Field was in a position of weakness. Rather than fall under the control of Mr. Icahn, it agreed yesterday to be taken over by Batus, the United States operating group for B.A.T. Industries of London."

But the true asbestos story is one of asbestos industry fraud and insurance industry incompetence. And the true questions are whether we are dealing with another industry bailout such as Chrysler, Penn Central, or Lockheed.

But those familiar with the tribunal's work said it had encountered controversies worse than anticipated when it set out to evaluate thousands of claims worth billions of dollars in what is called the largest and most complicated international arbitration ever conducted.   At one point, the Iranians began to protest bitterly over what they considered prejudicial remarks by Niels Mangaard, a Swede, who is one of three neutral members of the panel. They reportedly accused him of criticizing the execution of judges in Iran, but he is reported to have said he was misunderstood. What he was complaining about, Mr. Mangaard explained privately, was the execution of judgments in Iranian courts, not the execution of judges."

Credit market participants have to contend with rapid money supply growth that has raised fears of a tighter monetary policy and higher short-term interest rates while record-size Treasury borrowings put upward pressure on longer-term rates.   ''The battle lines between an expansionary fiscal and a highly restrictive monetary policy have now been clearly drawn in Washington,'' Donald Maude, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch, said in the Feb. 12 Weekly Credit Market Bulletin, ''with no give from either side in prospect over the immediate future.''   Mr. Maude goes on to say that some modest drop in short-term rates is still likely this quarter because the economic recession will inevitably reduce credit demands and money supply growth. However, he concluded that enough problems remained so that the declines ''could turn out to be somewhat restrained and most certainly short-lived.''"

The Soviet pronouncements have warned Western Europeans that the cost of following the American lead could be the collapse of the framework of political, economic and cultural ties that have developed with the Soviet bloc under the rubric of detente. There have been warning s that the Soviet Union coul d withhold lucrative economic contracts from European nations that yield to ''American pressure'' over Poland.   The Soviet press has also warned that the ''hysteria'' over Poland is a smoke screen behind which the United States plans to sabotage talks on limiting nuclear weapons. In particular, recent articles have asserted that the Reagan Administration is seeking to poison the climate of East-West relations so that it can disrupt the talks that opened in Geneva six weeks ago on limiting medium-range nuclear missiles."

The creation of that new division, the first time big companies have received special attention within the bank, was just one part of a recent major reorganization that was in turn just one part of Barclays' strategy to assure that the bank remains the largest and most profitable in Britain.   Perhaps most dramatically, the bank has substantially added to its presence in the United States.

The boyish looking Mr. d'Aubuisson promises to ''exterminate'' the guerrillas within three months of the convening of the new constituent assembly that is to be elected March 28 by putting the country on a war footing and sparing no tactic. ''Napalm is indispensable,'' explained his campaign spokesman, Willi Aleman. 'Civilians Will Be Killed'   The armed forces would be freed of human rights restrictions on their activities and encouraged to invade Nicaragua. ''We don't believe the army needs controlling,'' said Mario Redaelli, the secretary of Mr. d'Aubuisson's party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance.

There is great fascination with El Salvador and th e Caribbean right now. Could you share some idea of what is going to happen in the next few weeks?   A. I think basically our approach has been a clear one from the outset. First, we have to deal with the socio-economic conditions that create the breeding ground for external intervention and subversion. That is our first approach - that's the Caribbean Basin initiative, plus the economic programs, the works we do bilaterally with each of the nations within the region in the area of human rights, internal reform, land reform, sound economic planning.  Secondly, we attempt to assist the nations. We inherited this situation when the Administration came in - the insurgency in Salvador was running rampant, there was a major offensive in January of last year which was defeated by the Government, but which did not eliminate the threat.   We had a period where, because of our emphasis on the subject early last year, we had some decline in the shipment of armaments into Salvador. In the subsequent months, those arms began to pick up again, and they are now at a level which approximates the high point when we came into office."

They recovered large caches of food and arms, the officers said.

Since taking office, the Socialists have moved with surprising speed to put in place the building blocks of their promised ''policy of change'' - an attempt to blast the French economy out of recession with heavy Government spending financed in part by new taxes on the rich and a vast extension of the state-owned sector. The policies run contrary to the cautious, inflation-fighting, enterprise-encouraging policies now favored by other Western nations.    Demand is being stoked through a doubling of the Government's budget deficit, a result of the big rise in public investment spending, higher pensions and an increased minimum wage. The Socialists' economic cornerstone is a plan to nationalize the remaining French-owned private banks and 12 major industrial groups.  Although it was dealt a setback last month when France's supreme legal tribunal, the Constitutional Council, ruled that the original nationalization plan was illegal because inadequate compensation was being offered to shareholders, the Government responded with a plan to pay nearly $1.5 billion in additional compensation and by postponing until next year the nationalization of 22 of the 36 banks on its list while a commission works out a shareholder compensation plan."

According to a 1980 city report, the primary reasons for this, in addition to the growing desire of city residents to own their dwelling units, are that garden apartments are more expensive to maintain as rental units than conventional apartment buildings. They are generally not energy-efficient, and they are often spread over several acres, thus requiring more maintenance workers and higher labor costs.   Undoubtedly, one of the most welcomed - by other neighborhood residents - of these conversions is occurring in the southeast corner of Bayside, Queens, where the Sidney Kalikow Development Corporation is renovating part of the Heather Gardens garden-apartment development into a 179-unit condominium complex."

The simple name says nothing about the company's interesting new film and short-focal length glass lens, which made the disk format necessary. Nor does it reflect the improvements in electronics, manufacturing techniques and processing equipment that made the disk concept workable and, according to Kodak's estimates, potentially profitable.   In short, the word ''disk'' does not begin to tell the technological story behind the new cameras. That story is typical of many applied technology developments. The company committed itself to certain concepts. Then it worked simultaneously on several interdependent electronic, optical, mechanical and manufacturing problems that the concepts presented."

Botha's predecessor, John Vorster, emerged from retirement to side with the 22 members of Parliament who voted Wednesday against a motion of confidence in Mr.  Botha's leadership.   Until Mr. Vorster's statement in support of the stand taken by backers of Dr. Andries P. Treurnicht, the right-wing party leader in the Transvaal, it seemed that Mr. Botha had the upper hand in what is already the most severe split the formerly monolithic party has experienced since coming to power in 1948.   It was unclear this evening whether Mr. Vorster, whose health has been shaky, was contemplating a return to active politics. He is 66, the same age as Mr. Botha. Although he had to resign as Prime Minister in 1978 under pressure and, later, as ceremonial President because of his implication in a political scandal, he is thought to retain considerable influence and popularity in the party."

Even before that crucial test, two things about the market-opening program are evident.  First, last week's lifting of 67 nontariff barriers by the Japanese Cabinet - most of them dealing with product safety requirements and quality control proced ures - will have little near-term effect on thebig trade surpluses that Japan is running wit h the United States and the European Economic Community.   Second, if the program is judged to be a meaningful step in opening up Japan's economy to foreign products, the payoff for Japan - in terms of easing trade tensions - is likely to be greater in the United States than in Western Europe."

The Honduran Army controls all border crossings from Nicaragua and patrols the border with El Salvador, but it says it has not intercepted any major arms shipments destined for El Salvador since late January last year, a few days after the Salvadoran guerrillas began an abortive ''final offensive'' to topple the United Statesbacked junta.   In the weeks before that offensive, documents captured from the guerrillas suggested that most weapons were reaching them from Nicaragua overland through Honduras. The crash of several light aircraft inside El Salvador also seemed to show that some arms were being flown to the rebels."

John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, who heads the Senate panel, joined a growing list of legislators who are sponsoring similar bills aimed at forcing down foreign trade barriers with the threat of progressive exclusion of foreign traders from American markets.   The Congressional moves began late last year with a Senate-passed rider to a communications bill that would specifically bar Japan from selling telecommunications equipment here to the extent that American companies are kept out of the same market in Japan.   Although Japan is not cited in other bills sponsored by at least a dozen legislators, the drive has picked up momentum with the recent report of a record $18.1 billion American trade deficit with Japan and with the dissatisfaction now being expressed openly by American trade officials at the latest of a series of liberalization steps by the Tokyo Government."

A Japanese emissary, Shintaro Abe, Minister of Industry and Trade, met with President Reagan and also with members of Congress shortly after the trade figures were announced in Tokyo.

Stopping piracy, especially for Sin@gapore, now the second-largest port in the world and the third-largest oil-refining center, is crucial, since the city-state has based its economic plans in large part on the growth of shipping and refining, both of which are threatened if pirates are allowed to interfere with the orderly operation of shipping lanes or the safe anchorage of ships in Singapore's harbor.   Over the past year, there have been 29 reported incidents of piracy in the Phillip Channel, the narrow, five-mile sealane 13 miles south of Singapore, in Indonesian waters. The channel is the only passage for ships going from west to east through the Strait of Malacca into the South China Sea."

If the blacks were actually throwing stones, the answer would be easy. Instead, they have taken sanctuary inside St. George's Anglican Cathedral, which is adjacent to the Parliament building, and have vowed to fast there until they either die or win permission from the authorities to reside here legally with their families.   Those taking part in the fast belong to a larger group of Xhosaspeaking blacks who have spent most of the last nine months resisting efforts by the Government, which officially views them as illegal immigrants and foreigners, to expel them from Cape Town.   The contest of wills started last July when the police raided a hostel in Langa township, causing hundreds of so-called illegal blacks to flee into the surrounding bush where they soon established a squatters' camp. This was then followed by repeated raids and mass arrests, until finally the campsite was bulldozed and burned and the squatters deported to a supposedly independent homeland called Transkei."

''We have never accepted the U.S. charge of an arms flow through here,'' said Sergio Ramirez Mercado, a member of the three-man junta, ''but this does not mean that we're unwilling to discuss the point.''    Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. said Monday that a condition for opening negotiations with Nicaragua would be Managua's agreement to end what he characterized as its deep military involvement in El Salvador. The Sandinist Government has previously said it could not accept that point as a condition because it was not playing a direct role in the Salvadoran insurgency."

This trend, defense strategists and industry analysts say, raises the disturbing question of whether the industrial powers will be able to afford to arm themselves in the coming decade without arming the rest of the world at the same time.   The size of the trade and the many new players in it are increasingly sparking political and economic interest. The world arms trade was valued at $30 billion in transactions last year and has been growing by about $5 billion a year since 1975, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or Sipri, an independent agency that monitors the international arms bazaar.   But the most striking element of the rise has been in the cost of equipment. Today's XM1 tank, a heavily armed, 59-ton piece of hardware loaded with infrared devices and ele ctronic gear that would rival a jetliner's dashboard, costs about $1. 5 million. By contrast, the United States Army's standard World War I I tank, a lumbering hulk with relatively simple gear, sold for about $50,000 i n its day. The upward spiral in weaponry costs during the past 30 yea rs has beenfed by inflation in raw materials and labor coupled with t he everincreasing trend toward complexity in military equipme nt."

And nothing, it seemed, merited more serious attention than what were regarded as the historical ''sins'' of the United States against Nicaragua. Neverthless, there was Mr. Ortega smiling in Washington."

One remarked listlessly that tangerines were in the shops for the first time in a year.   ''Wonder which of our friends they come from,'' said a second, drawing out the word ''friends'' in heavy irony.  A third wondered when it would be possible to travel abroad again, so that she could leave the country for good. It was not, in the context of today's Poland, a non sequitur. For almost everyone, the combination of economic misery - despite the occasiona l tangerine - and oppressive restrictions of personal freedom under martial law has made everyday life just about unbearable.

Ronald Kincy, one of the 17, can prove it by producing an old pay card for that date, showing that his grandfather earned $1.50 a day as a construction worker for what would eventually become the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, the largest operating company, by some measures, in the Bell System today.   Some time back, an office worker was cleaning out old files, came across the pay card, and asked Mr. Kincy if he wanted it as a memento. It's the kind of thoughtful gesture one family member might make for another, and in the case of Ma Bell, it is perhaps fitting."

''Some time in May,'' says an aide to the Senate majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, who manages the Senate agenda.   The White House last week began addressing the issue - substance, timing and tactics.

''Without such respect for the rights of man, the normalization of the life of society, development of economic life and safeguarding of culture in all its expressions remain impossible,'' the Pope told a group of labor leaders from various countries whom he received in a special audience today.   The Pope thanked the union leaders for having met here to express their concern over events in his country, ''where many of your colleagues, workers and the entire population are suffering very grave trials.'' The labor officials included representatives from Italy, West Germany, France and Belgium as well as a number of Solidarity leaders who were outside Poland when martial law was declared Dec. 13."

St. Germain worked steadily to cultivate his political garden but rarely, despite growing seniority, did he find himself a place in the sun.   The people of Rhode Island's First Congressional District, of course, knew him as their man in Washington. He was the guy with the listed home telephone number who returned to Woonsocket each weekend and who liked nothing better than to drop in at the Ever-Ready Diner in Providence to eat franks and beans with his blue-collar constituents. They kept sending him back to Congress virtually without challenge.   In recent years the lobbyists and bureaucrats involved in banking and housing issues came to know Fred St. Germain, too, as he became an important legislative figure and subcommittee chairman. But except for brief periods, such as when he led an effort to tighten banking practices in the wake of the Bert Lance affair, Mr. St. Germain remained largely unknown."

We are all painfully aware of the prolonged, intense, and some say endemic inflation that has plagued the world economy in recent years.  This inflation has been both virulent and pervasive. It has nurtured a strong psychological bias of expectations that inflation will continue. The combination of past, actual, and expected inflation has influenced all economic decisions either to minimize the impact - or better yet - to take advantage of continued inflation."

Yet barely two years after the trade talks known as the Tokyo Round came to an end, nations are quarreling as they haven't since the 1930's over market access, discrimination, reciprocity, pricing - over the general principles of fairness in trade. And protectionism is on the march again.   - The Commerce Department, in response to vociferous complaints by the domestic steel industry, has filed proceedings against France, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Rumania, South Africa and Spain, accusing them of competing unfairly in selling steel in the American market.   - Seven American steel companies have filed for relief from lowpriced imports from 11 countries, mostly in Western Europe. They charge that those countries have subsidized their steelmakers, enabling them to ''dump'' products on the American market at prices below production costs. The petitions could lead to higher duties on the foreign steel and higher prices for American steel users."

Worse yet, he found, they can assemble the car in half the time.   Mr. Harbour delivered a 54-page report on his findings to senior executives at the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation in the fall of 1980. One company asked him not to publicize his work until it had time to study his analysis and consider adopting some of his recommendations.

Mr.  Lopez Andreu is the president of El Salvador's Chamber of Commerce.   What brought the two sides in this country's violently polarized politics together was their common loathing for the group in the middle, the Christian Democratic Party.   Led by the president of the military-civilian junta, Jose Napoleon Duarte, the Christian Democrats have taken hold of the center of El Salvador's political life and carry Washington's hopes in next Sunday's elections for a constituent assembly.   But at the same time, they have engendered such opposition from politically outspoken Salvadorans on both sides of the ideological spectrum that it is appears doubtful they can win a majority of seats in the election and open to question whether they could govern effectively if they did."

It has been so successful, especially with its Selectric line, that it is now the only American maker of heavy-duty typewriters and has almost 90 percent of the market.   But the tool the secretary uses to type letters and memos has been changing and is no longer merely electric.

Gromyko of the Soviet Union for eight hours today and said afterward that differences over Poland ''cast a long and dark shadow'' over all East-West issues.   In a news conference, Mr. Haig sought to leave the impression that the discussions had been as chilly and confrontational as he and his aides had advised beforehand that they would be.   There seemed to be no agreement on any major issue, and Mr. Haig said he had told Mr. Gromyko that the United States would not agree to new negotiations on strategic arms reduction until ''conditions permit,'' meaning an improvement in the Polish situation.   ''All in all the discussions were very sober,'' Mr. Haig said."

Officials in Israel briefed reporters on some aspects of the letter, and sources in Washington familiar with its contents also commented. The overall tone of the letter was said to have been friendly, in keeping with a pronounced effort by officials in the United States and Israel to avoid further recriminations and to put relations back on a cordial basis."

In Washington, an almost total preoccupation with the role of ''outside'' forces - Nicaraguan, Cuban or Soviet - has tended to cast the civil war as part of an East-West struggle important to the strategic interests of the United States.   In El Salvador, the perspective is different. Two weeks of conversations there with Salvadoran writers, artists, lawyers, business people and public officials leave a reporter traveling between Washington and San Salvador with the feeling that there are two El Salvador stories - if not two El Salvadors."

The measure was part of a package of new rules approved today that will speed up and simplify the filing of information, which all corporations must do each time they try to market new securities.   The controversial change in underwriting practices, affecting only major corporations that frequently market new issues, was adopted by a unanimous vote for a nine-month period. It will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register, expected within a few days, but the commission said that eligible companies could change their underwriting practices immediately. The other new rules approved today by the S.E.C. will also become effective upon publication in the Federal Register, but they will be permanent changes."

Taking advantage of the last day of the conference, which is supposed to reconvene here on Nov. 9, both the Soviet Union and the United States and its allies fired parting salvos that reflected widely varying interpretations of the 1975 Helsinki accords that this conference was set up to review.   Calling the Madrid talks ''a stage of lost opportunities,'' the Soviet delegation, in a press statement, blamed ''the U.S. delegation and the delegations of those NATO countries that have supported the U.S. destructive obstructionist line.''   The Soviet statement, repeated in a closed session of all members, said the West was being led ''upon the path of cold war, the path of destroying everything positive that has been achieved over the years of detente, of the life of the process initiated in Helsinki.'' Clearly alluding to Poland, the Russians accused the United States of trying to dictate the ''internal and foreign policy'' of some nations."

According to a Government spokesman, the Cabinet was told by Count Otto Lambsdorff, the Minister for Economic Affairs, that the United States' request not to undercut its sanctions against the Soviet Union ''referred only to such American deliveries in which the United States is the prime supplier, and not a secondary supplier.''   The disclosure follows a decision last week by the United States to deny export licenses to the General Electric Company for the delivery of $175 million of components for the Siberian pipeline.   Though the West German spokesman, Kurt Becker, refused to apply Count Lambsdorff's interpretation to particular deals, it evidently meant that Bonn would not prevent companies from seeking other suppliers."

It became free to issue $3.7 billion in checks at 12:01 A.M. today, at the expiration of a deadline set by a Federal appeals court. The money will buy 51 percent of the Marathon shares.   The Bankers Trust announcement came yesterday afternoon, shortly after Chief Justice Warren E. Burger turned down the Mobil Corporation's final appeal to block U.S. Steel's acquisition of Marathon. Mobil sought time for a Supreme Court review of the antitrust rulings that blocked its competing bid for Marathon.

After his last news conference a month ago, the President was criticized for his handling of purely factual matters and it seemed likely this could happen again. At one point in today's news conference, a reporter said that in the 1960's the Central Intelligence Agency had contrived a ''secret plan to get us involved in Vietnam in a surreptitious, covert manner,'' and asked if the President could assure the public that the United States would not be similarly drawn deeper into El Salvador.   Most students of recent Vietnamese history would disagree that such a ''secret plan'' existed, and Mr. Reagan also expressed disagreement with the premise of the question."

The police, pointing to pilot error as the cause of the accident, said that one of the airliner's four jet engines was put into reverse thrust just before the crash, causing the plane to lose altitude sharply.

However, their final total would not give them the majority needed to control the new constituent assembly.   The extreme right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance of Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former army major, was in what the United States Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton, called a ''strong second position.'' The conservative National Conciliation Party, which ran El Salvador from 1961 to 1979, was in third place.   The outcome touched off a series of political meetings in the capital aimed at establishing a parliamentary coalition. The negotations are critical for El Salvador's immediate future because the new assembly will have the power to name an interim government, rewrite the country's constitution and call presidential elections in 1983."

After 16 months, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as the gathering is officially known, had done little to enhance the security of the 35 signers of the Helsinki accords of 1975 and had evinced more discord than cooperation between East and West.   Negotiations over a concluding document that might have strengthened the Helsinki accords - in such areas as family reunification, terrorism, journalists' working conditions and scientific exchanges - were fruitless, cut short by polemics over Poland.   Yet, as they departed, few diplomats who attended the meeting felt that they were the true authors of this impasse. Rather, as one Norwegian put it, ''the most dangerous international situation since the end of World War II'' had shaped, troubled and, finally, undermined the gathering."

At his news conference yesterday, President Reagan offered one of his favorite remedies for balancing the budget: an attack on waste and inefficiency. He said he would appoint a private-sector commission on cost containment. However, as though in recognition of the incredulity that might greet this standard ploy for rooting out scores of billions in waste, Mr. Reagan said this would represent ''the largest effort of its kind ever attempted.''   The one notable thing about his proposal was that he put the Defense Department at the head of his list of agencies to be surveyed for waste and inefficiency."

''This question has created much conflict among bankruptcy judges and district courts throughout the nation,'' the appeals court observed in the 40-page decision, which it handed down on Tuesday in Manhattan."

This unusual collection of suppliers is reported struggling both openly and covertly, along with the United States, for influence over Iran's future and over the balance of power in the Middle East.   The arms they are providing enable Iran to continue the 18-monthold war against Iraq and may even permit it to prevail, with all of the implications that holds for the spread of Islamic revolution to other parts of the Persian Gulf. Arrangements Are Complex   According to documents - telex messsages, contracts and bills of lading - $100 million to $200 million in arms, spare parts and ammunition were delivered to Iran from Western Europe in the last 18 months. The intelligence sources said the documents indicated that about half of this was being supplied or arranged by Israel, and the rest by freelance arms merchants, some of whom may also have connections with Israeli intelligence."

But the chronic waste and inefficiency of Soviet workers sometimes drive planners to mumble that a limited dose of joblessness may not, after all, be amiss.   Soviet law requires every man to hold a job - otherwise he becomes an illegal ''parasite'' - and employment bureaus are bound to supply work according to a man's qualifications. But the excitement of building Communism that was originally supposed to motivate Soviet workers has distinctly waned. Bonuses for overfulfilling plans have lost their attraction because there is so little to buy in the stores, and centralized bureaucracy has all but stamped out any incentive for inititative."

Their concern was that the attention given the one Nicaraguan would detract from what the Administration regards as very compelling evidence, a view shared by both intelligence committees in Congress, that Nicaraguans and Cubans are deeply involved in the Salvadoran insurgency.   Reports from Mexico, confirmed late in the day by the State Department, said a Nicaraguan was inside the Mexican Embassy in San Salvador, having either eluded the Salvadoran police or having escaped from them."

Cravath, the patriarch of one of Wall Street's most prestigious law firms, described the qualities he looked for in the young men he hired.   ''Brilliant intellectual powers are not essential,'' he told an audience of Harvard Law School students. ''Too much imagination, too much wit, too great cleverness, too facile fluency, if not leavened by a sound sense of proportion, are quite as likely to impede success as to promote it. The best clients are apt to be afraid of those qualities.''   Cravath, Swaine & Moore has loosened and livened up considerably since then. But for the International Business Machines Corporation, represented by Cravath for 13 tortuous years, the attractions of the firm remain the same. The traits that Paul Cravath cherished - industry, precision, patience and perseverance -were responsible, they say, for the dismissal of the Government's case against them and their vindication in courts throughout the country."

Pierpont Morgan, whose own American ancestry dates to 1636. An offspring of the House of Morgan, Morgan Stanley has grown rich as the banker to blue chip corporate America, with a client list that is the envy of Wall Street.   It earns a 20 percent after-tax return on equity. Each year, it either leads or is in the top tier of the numerous lists that rank Wall Street firms. In 1981, it appeared as lead manager on $11.76 billion worth of corporate stock and bond issues, taking the No. 1 slot by that measure for the third consecutive year. Its clients, including 15 to 20 of the nation's 50 largest companies, carry names like American Telephone, General Electric, Exxon and Du Pont.   But the world of Wall Street is changing, in ways that could threaten to crack Morgan's noble walls. New regulations, primarily the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 415, which allows corporations to sell securities directly to investors, pose a threat. Upstart competitors are hunting among Morgan's clients; Morgan has even bent its rule on being sole manager of corporate industrial issues. A retail distribution network, which Morgan lacks, is considered by many the key to growth."

At the same time, leaders of the Bedouin and Druse communities, as well as 31 of the 54 Arab local councils in Israel, declared that they would not follow the call to strike Tuesday issued by an organization supporting Arab land rights and backed by other Israeli Arab groups, many of them Communists or under Communist influence.   Tension on the West Bank continued with scattered protest action.  In the only reported act of violence, a member of the Kibbutz Gush Etzion, in occupied territory south of Jerusalem, was stoned while driving on the Jerusalem-Hebron road. Injured, he retaliated by opening fire, wounding one of his attackers. He was held for questioning. The extent of the injuries to both was not made known."

The figure for the week ended Jan. 27, however, reflected seasonal adjustments and benchmark revisions made by the Fed to its series of money supply data.

It was expected that by this weekend the Federal agency, which insures deposits in savings and commercial banks, will narrow its choices to two of the groups, and that the final decision will be made by the end of the month, the sources said.   The New York Bank for Savings, which has its headquarters at 1230 Avenue of the Americas, has 19 branches, not including those of its divisions. The bank's assets total about $3.5 billion. Following a $34.7 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 1981, its surplus - the amount by which its assets exceed its liabilities - dropped to $37.3 million, barely enough to get it through the present quarter if interest rates remain at or near present levels."

Alden Jr., a vice president with Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, a New York employee benefits consulting firm.   Essentially, the arrangement allows workers to defer as much as 10 percent - sometimes more - of their salary each year, and to then put that money into a company profit-sharing or savings plan. With an I.R.A., by contrast, workers can only contribute a maximum of $2,000 a year."

Friday, E.S.T.) The state of security in the country and the state of public order provided the main subject of the meeting of the parliamentary commission for internal affairs and the administration of justice, which met under the chairmanship of Zygmunt Surowiec. Part of the session was attended by the Speaker of Parliament, Stanislaw Gucwa.   A report was delivered by First Deputy Minister for Internal Affairs Boguslaw Stachura. To begin, he informed the deputies that peace was reigning throughout the country. He also said, among other things:   The leadership of the state, especially since February 1981, made many attempts to prevent the dangerous trends that became apparent during the post-August renewal. Despite economic difficulties, the authorities undertook efforts aimed at improving public supplies.  The destructive activities of the extremists sought to paralyze these initiatives. In the first 10 days of December the specter of civil war began to emerge with force. The 10-12 December meeting of the Solidarity national commission left no ill usi ons as to the intentionsof the enemy. The country faced the threat of a general strike as well as the danger of people being brought on to the streets on the anniversary of the events of December 1970."

They call it the ''Accountants' Relief Act,'' and they're not far off. The radical changes that Congress enacted last year in the nation's tax system is translating into big business for accountants this year, when those provisions take effect. And 1982 shapes up as the year of the accountant, if there ever was one.   ''Accounting flourishes when there is change,'' said Henry Gunders, co-chairman at Price, Waterhouse & Company, which ranks No. 4 among the elite Big Eight firms that dominate the accounting profession.  Russell E. Palmer, chairman of Touche Ross & Company, the No. 8 firm, added that ''1981 was our best year ever. And 1982 will be even better.''   The accounting business is bursting not only in the Park Avenue towers where the leading firms are based, but also in the offices of certified public accountants throughout the land. Greater demands by municipalities, businesses and individuals for more precise information of all types, particulary more accurate financial information, have made the accountant a much sought-out individual.  Everybody seems to need accountants. ''You have much more complex problems that you are dealing with,'' explained William L. Raby, chairman of the Federal tax division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. ''It's not enough to be somebody who knows a little about taxes. That's becoming dangerous.''"

This agreement, the agency said, was reached during Colonel Qaddafi's five-day stay in Algiers.   Algeria had long resisted such a merger, although its leaders - notably the late President Houari Boumediene - have said on various occasions that in principle the proposed Islamic Republic was a good idea.

It is not so precarious, financial experts say, that a widespread collapse is imminent, although it is possible that Braniff, International Harvester or one or more of the other major companies already in financial straits could go under.   What concerns analysts most is that a broad range of American companies have left themselves little cushion against adversity, be it high interest rates, a prolonged recession or a crisis of confidence in the financial markets.   For most corporations, having a margin of safety is simply a matter of having enough readily available funds to pay their bills in the near future, no matter what happens to earnings. Financial analysts call this liquidity, and it is this measure of future solvency that many believe has gotten dangerously low in recent years, particularly in an era of soft earnings and seesawing interest rates."

Commodity traders have been startled by such high prices at this time. Governments, manufacturers and the governors of world exchanges have been investigating the scheme, pooh-poohing it, taking steps to undercut it, asking how much more the speculators can spend and, generally, filling the narrow world of big-time tin with the shrewd and wild gossip that attends every such manipulation.   On the floor of the London Metal Exchange, where much of the world's tin is traded, the prevailing rumor is that the Malaysian Government lies behind the gigantic purchases, which have amounted so far to 20,000 and perhaps even 30,000 tons of soft, shiny, useful, unglamorous tin."

The first (Economic Approach A) relies on ''a little wild incomprehensibility.''

''If you do,'' he quickly goes on, ''I think you're forgetting that the Bank of England's discretionary action on the cash basis took the shape of dealing in Treasury Bills, the market rate of discount on which could and did fluctuate.''"

An increasing number of professional soldiers in Europe believe this strategy is unwise.

Times have never been worse for OPEC. Oil prices keep slipping, economists keep pushing back estimates of the strength and timing of recovery in major consuming nations, and the cartel's own revenues are falling sharply. So the OPEC gathering in Vienna this week is likely to be a critical and cantankerous one.   Much of action may take place before Friday, when the session formally begins, says Philip Verleger, an oil analyst with Booz Allen Hamilton. In order to defuse bickering about future production levels, Saudi Arabia, which has cut ouput by roughly 3 million barrels a day in the last 12 months, to 7.5 million, may announce more cuts as well as a price drop of around $2 a barrel. However, those steps may not be enough, Mr. Verleger says."

The banks, the first in the West to announce such action, thus officially confirmed to their shareholders that Poland was not paying interest as originally scheduled. But the two institutions did not write off their loans, which were well below $100 million, as losses.    In fact, bankers said, the fact that these loans were put in the ''nonperforming'' category and not listed as losses indicated a belief that the loans would eventually be repaid. Bankers Remain Sanguine   The accounting steps reflected an attitude that is widespread among American bankers with loans to Poland. Although they have been frustrated in their attempts to collect overdue interest payments, the bankers say the situation does not threaten the basic soundness of the international banking structure or the soundness of any individual bank."

In a Senate committee hearing, Deputy Secretary of State Walter J. Stoessel Jr. said the United States would not ''accept that the future of the Caribbean basin be manipulated from Havana.''

To naturalists, the reasons are ecological, but to activist university students who have led a two-year campaign in Assam against unrestricted settlement in the state by people from neighboring Bangladesh, the proposed transfer is an attempt by the central Government to deprive the Assamese of a tourist attraction.   At the start of this century there were reported to be only a dozen of the animals in India. Now there are said to be more than 1,400.  Sharad Gaur, an education officer of the World Wildlife Fund, said the rhinos had multiplied faster than expected in the last decade and the concentration in Assam's Kaziranga preserve had reached ''the saturation point.''"

Like lots of new technology, the product involved does not sound like much. It's called a micro Winchester drive, or rigid micro disk drive. A micro Winchester is a memory storage device for personal computers that uses a 5 1/4-inch metal memory disk. It is both a challenger and a companion to the so-called ''floppy'' disk drive, itself only 10 years old and the memory device now used most often in personal computers. Just since last January, almost 30 companies have announced their entries into the Winchester drive market, according to John Trifari, West Coast ed itor of Mini-Micro Systems, a computer trade magazine.  And during on e particularly busy week last November, at least six companies ope ned their doors for business."

Haig Jr. said today that the United States would press its allies at a special NATO meeting here Monday for agreement on a framework for imposing sanctions against Moscow if the situation in Poland is not ''remedied in the immediate future.''   Mr. Haig, speaking at a news conference aboard his Air Force plane flying to the first emergency foreign ministers' meeting in the history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said that the United States also intended to ask the allies for a statement condemning Soviet involvement in the Polish situation.   Mr. Haig's comments about what he expected from the alliance went beyond what he had said in Washington last week after President Reagan had met with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany. Then, Mr. Haig indicated that the United States would not press for economic sanctions against the Russians - something opposed by Bonn at this time - and seemed satisfied with the NATO meeting limiting itself to a statement holding Moscow responsible for the Polish crisis.   Mr. Haig said he was concerned that the Western allies not soften their response to the events in Poland by what he called ''the phony moderation'' of the Polish leadership in recent days."

After a round of meetings with the Mexican Foreign Minister, Don Jorge Castaneda, Mr. Alexander Haig made public a five-point proposal aimed at initiating conversations with Nicaragua following the elections scheduled for March 28th in El Salvador.   The mere fact that the United States makes public a willingness to negotiate with Nicaragua on the basis of these points could be considered an encouraging element; but it turns out to be contradictory because, as I have been demonstrating throughout this exposition, the aggressive and destablilizing actions against Nicaragua by the U.S. Administration have been dramatically on the rise.   The five points announced by Mr. Haig do not constitute a global approach to search for and find realistic solutions. The proposal fails to take into account the fact that the fundamental problem of the Central American crisis does not consist of the never-proven allegation that arms are reaching the Salvadoran revolutionaries via Nicaragua while, on the other hand, the United States is supplying arms, airplanes, helicopters, advisers, technical support and hurried military training to the Salvadoran army."

The assumption is wrong, an old cliche. Gelsenkirchen, although no Alhambra, looks clean and cared-for, and it feels friendly. But the city itself, like dozens of others, is in deep trouble, a situation that undercuts the widely held assumptions about postwar West Germany.   The crisis of the cities that is developing means that cuts in social services, education and leisure expenditures are for the first time being considered in the light of debt and poor economic prospects. Just as the accepted notions of the 1960's and 1970's about the strengths and stability of the West German armed forces, labor unions, press and academic worlds seem less certain, so does the idea that West Germany has built an indestructible shell of prosperity and soc ial welfare."

The 100-page report to Mr. Apel on the West German military over the next 20 years was made 16 months ago by the ministry's planning staff but came to light only recently. It says that ''additional data will not change the trends.''   It warns that a web of financial, personnel and political problems has created circumstances in which it is incr easingly questionable if West Germany can fully maintain over the n ext decades its commitments to NATO, its force levels and the advanced technological status of its fighting units. Assumptions Being Questioned   For more than two decades after their creation in 1955, the armed forces seemed to reflect basic assumptions about the stability and economic strength of the young West German democracy. Now, as assumptions about the country's prosperity and the immutability of some of its institutions -the cities, the labor unions and the press, for example - seem less certain, so do the standard, almost reflexive, views of the armed forces."

But they disagreed over the issue of Nicaraguan arms shipments to leftist insurgents in El Salvador.   After the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, Mr. Haig told reporters that a failure to deal with the Nicaraguan concern was the principal weakness in the peace plan advanced last month by President Jose Lopez Portillo of Mexico.   Mr. Castaneda described the current arms flow from Nicaragua to El Salvador as ''fairly small and unimportant.'' Halting it, he said, depends on United States concessions, among them a less belligerent attitude toward Nicaragua."

Many experts argue that the concessions agreed to by the United Automobile Workers will obviously have a powerful ''demonstration effect'' for other businesses throughout the economy, thus toughening the bargaining stance of managers elsewhere and leading to widespread worker ''givebacks.''   Others contend, however, that the impact of the widely publicized settlements will be limited by the fact that both the wages and the business conditions prevailing in the auto industry were exceptional - a circumstance that has undermined thetraditional trend-setting role. Unions Created Major Gap   ''I doubt it will have much impact on other sectors of the economy,'' said Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford. ''The United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers of America have managed to create a major gap between their own compensation rates and the average for manufacturing wages. They succeeded in pricing their labor out of the market relative to both American and foreign competition."

The confidence motion dealt mainly with the Government's new program of economic stimulants, but it specifically included the Chancellor's foreign and security policies as well. As a result, the balloting in the regional conventions, summoned to prepare for a national party convention in April, had the character of gestures of dissatisfaction with Mr. Schmidt's leadership."
