Outplacement firms, graduate schools of business and industry groups are confronting the ethical considerations raised, as are some beleaguered brokerage firms.   At Drexel Burnham Lambert, the big investment banking and brokerage firm at the center of the continuing investigations, Frederick H. Joseph, the chief executive officer, said last week that he supported stricter rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission and wider surveillance tools for the firms, possibly including wiretapping of employees' telephone conversations.   Drexel has come under scrutiny because of its connections with Ivan F. Boesky, Dennis Levine and others involved in S.E.C. investigations into insider information on takeovers. Just last week, one former securities analyst at Drexel, Robert Salsbury, was sentenced to three years' probation for illegal insider trading."

Ralph Wanger, portfolio manager of the Acorn Fund in Chicago, for one, says stocks will continue to do well. ''At this point, stocks are attractive for the long term,'' he said.

But just up the road from this industrial ghost town, a bustling campus-like complex of neat lawns and buildings has become one of Cleveland's great hopes for rejuvenating its economy. This oasis in a desert of urban decay is the Cleveland Clinic, the medical institution that has gained international renown for its treatment of cardiovascular disease and other serious illnesses.   Lately, though, the Cleveland Clinic has earned another distinction: Its 8,879 employees make it the city's largest private employer, edging out the LTV Steel Company, the nation's second-largest steelmaker, which is now in bankruptcy proceedings. A Star in the Service Economy    Economists and political leaders have voiced concern that the transformation of the United States from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy would leave in its wake a country of hamburger flippers. But a look at the clinic, with its assortment of low- and high-powered jobs and the prominent role it has come to play in the local economy, shows this is not necessarily so."

Not only did more shares trade hands at the close than ever before -over 85 million - but the stock market handled the huge order flow ''without a glitch,'' according to Richard Torrenzano, a New York Stock Exchange spokesman.

Generally, on triple expiration Fridays, most of the attention is focused on the relationship between the expiring futures contracts and the underlying stocks. But yesterday, most of the action, and the reason stock prices rose at the close, was due to the relationship between the price of the March Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract and the underlying stocks."

THE CHAIN OF COMMAND,"  The decision by Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent has spurred debate on whether President Reagan can legally force them to abandon those rights - or should at least try to persuade them to do so.   The first question is primarily one of law: Does the President, as Commander-in-Chief, have authority to order active-duty officers to give possibly incriminating testimony about their official actions on matters of great public importance, on pain of demotion, dismissal or even court-martial if they refuse?   The second question goes to the ambiguous place of the privilege against self-incrimination in the nation's hierarchy of values.

But considering that his ''Road to Victory'' - the 1,351-page seventh volume of the Churchill biography, just published here - was his third book to appear in Britain this year and his fifth in the last two years, Mr. Gilbert obviously stands in a class of his own when it comes to output. The Churchill tome was preceded by ''The Holocaust,'' an 828-page chronicle of the Nazi effort to exterminate Europe's Jews that in the estimation of The Times Literary Supplement, ''is likely to remain the standard history.''   And that was preceded, by only a few weeks, by the publication of a 412-page biography of Anatoly Shcharansky, the jailed campaigner for the rights of Soviet Jews who was finally freed and allowed to leave Russia early this year.

Chrysler cars are not sold in Japan, but as of last month its stock has been. With its shares now listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the name of Chrysler is shouted by traders in Tokyo as loudly as it is on Wall Street.   That means Mr. Zuckerman must stay on top of developments in Tokyo - just as other Chrysler executives do on the manufacturing side. Some day Chrysler may very well issue new equity into the Tokyo market. And the fact that a Detroit company has traveled to the financial markets of one of its arch automobile rivals, shows just how global the world of finance has become.   Technology is shrinking the world of finance so that today it is often as easy for an American company to raise capital in London as it is in New York. And, for executives like Mr. Zuckerman, who masterminds Chrysler's financial strategy, the task of being a chief financial officer means he is called on to make more complex decisions than ever before."

The operation, linked to the release of American hostages in Lebanon, involved the use of phony passports, travel under assumed names and flights from Israel and Europe by American and Israeli pilots, according to the sources.   A role has also been played by a Danish ship and Danish seamen, and by mysterious fronts, such as a now defunct Nigerian company based in Brussels. Three Shipments Are Known    Three shipments of military equipment to Iran have become known: plane deliveries in September 1985, and last July, and a shipload a few weeks ago. The three deliveries, believed to contain millions of dollars worth of military materiel, coincided with the release of American hostages."

In addition, these experts say that some Iranian leaders may be questioning the wisdom of giving unlimited support to radical Islamic groups abroad, and that a campaign has been stepped up to discredit Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the designated successsor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian spiritual leader. Mr. Montazeri is a passionate promoter of exporting revolution.   ''Because of very low reserves in hard currency and gold, the regime is in a tight economic bind,'' said Shahrough Akhavi, professor of government at the University of South Carolina. ''Iran needs arms; it needs to sell its oil, and for these reasons it may be trying to project a better image abroad.''"

Layoffs Planned    The consolidation will lead to an unspecified number of layoffs at the Washington-based company, which has grown in 20 years from the upstart that broke the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's long-distance monopoly into a multinational with 16,000 employees and nearly five million customers.   ''We can't say how big the cutback will be, but I'm sure we will end the year with more people than we had at the beginning,'' said Howard C. Crane, senior vice president in charge of corporate affairs, noting that the company had 13,000 employees in January."

But what company stands for the tomato, the carrot or the green pepper? Except for a handful of widely known brand names, the nation's produce sections are teeming with fresh fruits and vegetables of uncertain lineage.   That may be about to change, however. Some of the largest food companies - Campbell Soup, Kraft, Pillsbury, Dole, Del Monte and others -are seeking to enter or expand their presence in the fresh produce business with a host of new brand names.   Within a few years, food companies hope, the brands could account for 10 percent or more of total annual produce sales of $20 billion and in the long run could go much higher."

As OPEC squabbled over ways to get prices back up, Sheik Yamani was often the moderating voice. But now many OPEC members want to return to fixed prices, rather than production quotas, and Sheik Yamani had been perceived by some as an impediment. Saudi Arabia gave no reason for the Sheik's dismissal after 24 years, but many analysts believe the kingdom was under pressure from other OPEC members - particularly Iran, which needs higher oil revenues to finance its war with Iraq.   The Saudis called for an emergency meeting of OPEC's price committee, where the acting Saudi minister, Hisham Nazer, is expected to push for prices of at least $18 a barrel. But despite a surge in oil prices immediately after the dismissal, analysts say it will be awhile before any concrete action can take effect."

They received little notice although their work this year produced stunning revelations on Wall Street and generated millions of dollars worth of new products.   For the most part, 1986 was a year in which Americans were swept up by national pride, a spirit generated by the celebration of the Statue of Liberty's centennial. People were eager to buy just about anything that smacked of Americana - from a $40 photo essay of the nation, which becamse the hottest Christmas seller in the bookstores, to a $400 gold coin newly issued by the United States Mint. The health binge this year put the spotlight on calcium, which turned up in the most unlikely places: orange juice, for example. And despite the drop in the dollar and the burst of patroitism, Americans purchased imports in greater volume than ever beofre in '86. That generated a big payoff for one South Korean automaker who dared to bring a new car into the oversupplied American market.

The irrepressible Mr. Antonini has plenty of challenges ahead, for K Mart, the nation's leading discounter and No. 2 retailer, is in a crucial period of transition.   K Mart is caught in a continuing race both to catch up with Sears, Roebuck & Company, the No. 1 retailer, and to stay ahead of the fast-growing Wal-Mart, the second-largest discounter.

The amendment says that ''no person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.''   Until now, the most dramatic uses of this right occurred in the 1950's during the anti-Communist campaign of Senator Joseph R.

Lear also said that it planned a restructuring if the Wickes deal fell through, but did not elaborate."

This week, for example, investment bankers have scheduled offerings of low-quality bonds and preferred stock exceeding $2.8 billion. Although interest rates for some kinds of debt have increased as much as a percentage point since mid-November, analysts expect the new issues to be sold and the supply to continue heavy through January.   It was Nov. 14 when Ivan F. Boesky, the trader, agreed to pay a penalty to the Government for profiting from the illegal use of inside information. When Federal investigators then issued subpoenas to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and some of its executives, prices of junk bonds began to weaken and their yields rose. Because Drexel is by far the leading underwriter and trader of such bonds, investors worried that problems at the firm might make it harder to trade them in the secondary market."

Yet, it announced the decision quite cheerfully.   In a country that in recent years has seen its gross domestic product contract - with a sharp 12 percent decline in 1983 that resulted from damage caused by heavy rains from the tropical current El Nino - it is still very much of a novelty to be struggling with problems of growth rather than recession.   Over the past 15 months, the Peruvian economy has gradually begun to come alive. Although many economists question whether the recovery can last, economic growth this year should be about 6.5 percent, a larger increase than at any time since 1974. Manufacturing production alone should expand by as much as 20 percent in 1986."

I have indications that the other two members do not want to extend it. So it seems somewhat ridiculous for me to make that motion.''"

The officials said that the ransom plan was only the most obvious sign that the Iran operation in the White House, run largely by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, was principally geared to freeing hostages and that the other reasons given by President Reagan, such as seeking an opening to moderates in Iran, were secondary.

IDEA,"  Government officials said today that the Central Intelligence Agency originally proposed the idea of keeping the Iran arms sale secret from Congress. They said the agency took the unusual step in the first draft of what became a Presidential order guiding the program.   The decision not to tell Congress was a crucial step in the Iran affair, according to Administration officials, because it meant that the entire operation had to be run outside normal channels.   The issue of what one official termed an ''off the books'' covert action has become significant because the Defense Department and the State Department were largely kept in the dark about the program, and even C.I.A. officials have testified to Congress that they knew little about the details. C.I.A. Contingency Fund    One result of keeping the matter from Congress was that the agency's multimillion-dollar contingency fund could not be used to underwrite the arms.

James D. Squires, the editor, said that ''when history looks back at this event,'' he wanted The Tribune's coverage to be ''cautious, fair, and honest from the beginning.''   Such special sensitivity to fairness, and to being perceived as fair, is a topic of almost daily discussion in the newsrooms of many of the country's largest news organizations, according to a spot check.   While many editors say their concern for fairness was already established and has not changed, many also report a heightened attentiveness to established standards."

The Iranian statement, reported in a state radio broadcast that was monitored in Cyprus, was issued as callers claiming to speak for four different groups said they were responsible.   The Iraqi Airways Boeing 737 crashed in a remote desert region in northern Saudi Arabia Thursday after being commandeered by armed men who, according to witnesses, subsequently battled with security men as the crew struggled to control the plane.   Government sources in Amman said the gunmen confessed to Saudi interrogators that they had planned to take the plane to Damascus and on to Teheran. But the Saudi Government, which provided the first official announcement of the crash, remained silent about the hijacking, and questions remained about many aspects of the disaster, including the number of people on board the flight, the number who died or were injured, the number of hijackers involved, and to what group, if any, they were linked."

When asked whether the weapons had been taken from Army stocks in Europe, he paused for a long time and said, ''Maybe.''

Mr. Reagan has angrily denied reports that he traded arms for American hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian militants. Many of his critics challenge this assertion. Some experts who have followed the United States-Iran relationship, ranging from former Directors of Central Intelligence to scholars, were asked these questions: Is it good or bad to trade military supplies for hostages? What are the pros and cons of making such overtures to the Iranians? And what are the prospects for the United States to restore and improve its ruptured relations with Iran? Here are excerpts from their replies:  SHAUL BAKHASH  Professor of Government George Mason University    For the U.S. Government that has made the foundation of its policy not to bargain with hostage-takers, trading arms for hostages is not a very wise policy. It encourages further hostage-taking; it sends the wrong signals to America's allies, and it suggests that the U.S. Government has not been straightforward with its own people."

The new tax code calls for a comprehensive rethinking of one's entire strategy - and puts a premium on prompt action. And, compounding the difficulty, it will bring profound, largely unpredictable changes in the $4 trillion United States economy.   This is a tough combination of challenges for investors, and no amount of computer-power can meaningfully forecast how an almost infinite number of forces will play out as the new law unleashes a shower of unintended consequences, as well as many others that are largely unquantifiable.   Alan Greenspan, the respected New York economist who served as chief economic adviser to President Gerald R. Ford, maintains that the new law probably contains ''10 or 20 major mistakes'' that, for the sake of the economy or of fairness will have to be rectified with additional legislation."

His statement came during a tour of three southern islands that seemed to mimic some elements of a simultaneous swing by President Corazon C. Aquino through two neighboring islands.   In his speeches to military and civilian audiences in Cebu, Jolo and this city in southern Mindanao, Mr. Enrile questioned the President's policy of negotiating with Communist insurgents, calling it ''simplistic and naive.''

That university students, the chosen young, should demonstrate in such numbers in favor of political principles closely associated in the minds of Chinese with the non-Communist West, particularly the United States, has raised disturbing questions among many here about the direction of economic and political change in China.   The largest rallies were in Shanghai last weekend, where close to 50,000 people were estimated to have gathered on Sunday alone. But they also occurred in Beijing and about half a dozen other cities. Today there were reports that 3,000 students demonstrated in the port city of Tianjin to show their solidarity with the Shanghai protests."

And they had reason to believe this, based on the two leaders' pledge last November in Geneva to seek an ''interim'' accord on medium-range weapons, and based on more recent public statements by Soviet leaders.   But today in the dramatic finale to their two-day get-together, Mikhail S. Gorbachev told them they were wrong.   To the Soviet leader, every agreement to reduce arms depended on American willingness essentially to scrap Mr. Reagan's dream for space-based defenses against missile attacks.   And he had a basis for this belief as well. That same joint statement in Geneva pledged the two sides to ''accelerate'' efforts to ''prevent an arms race in space.''"

Confronted by reporters and photographers on the museum steps, Mr. Saunders said, ''I see no reason why I should let it spoil my party.''   Yet, that will probably be the last Guinness party for a while. The Government inquiry could have scarcely come at a worse time. The dust had just settled - or so it seemed to Mr. Saunders, who is avoiding the press for the moment - from the bitter but successful takeover fight for the Distillers Company earlier this year. For the past few months Mr. Saunders, a marketing whiz and ruthless cost-cutter dubbed ''Deadly Ernest'' for his hard-nosed style, has been scrutinizing the Distillers empire with an eye toward major changes.   Guinness, according to analysts and insiders, was about to unveil a bold plan for streamlining the bloated Distillers organization and reviving worldwide sales of its stable of blue-chip Scotch whisky brands led by Johnnie Walker, Dewar's and White Horse. The cost-cutting promises to be far easier than the global marketing push, in light of the steady decline in worldwide Scotch sales in recent years as drinkers shun heavier spirits in favor of lighter-tasting, lower-alcohol beverages."

THE words are chisled along the rim of the rotunda in the Crossland Savings Bank, once the midtown headquarters of New York's Greenwich Savings Bank. Like the ornate building itself, the homily is florid tribute to a thriftiness Americans have long preached but rarely practiced.   The fact is, Americans as individuals save less than their counterparts in the rest of the industrialized world. And the national savings rate - a broader gauge that measures personal, business and Government saving - is lower than in any European country or Japan. Neither economists or governments can quite agree on how savings should be measured, but one accepted way of adjusting the figures puts the rate here at about 3.1 percent of gross national product, compared with about 15 percent for Japan and 7 percent to 10 percent in Europe - a gap that has prevailed during much of the post-world War II era."

Morgan & Company, the First Chicago Corporation, the Security Pacific Corporation and the Irving Bank Corporation reported profit increases ranging from 1 percent to 24.7 percent compared with results a year ago.But the Chase Manhattan Corporation said its third-quarter net fell 8 percent, citing one-time charges and an $80 million increase in its provision for loan losses. A Chase spokesman also said about 1,000 jobs at the bank would be eliminated in a cost-cutting effort."

It referred to what a columnist for the paper called ''an unfurling of superfluous messages and excessive sorrows'' that followed the death Thursday of Thierry Le Luron, a popular 34-year-old nightclub comedian whose specialty consisted of uncannily accurate caricatures of France's political figures.   Le Monde's columnist, Daniele Heymann, was about the only commentator here on the day after Mr. Le Luron's death to note the exaggerated and deeply emotional effect that the event had on French society, which treated it with degrees of bereavement and attention worthy of the passing of a head of state or a giant of literature.   Mr. Le Luron, a slight, boyish man popular here for the last decade or so, was known, among other things, for his creation of a character called Adolphe-Benito Glandu. The character was a rightist bigot full of rancor whom he lampooned with savage effect - in so doing lampooning as well a certain prototype of the ordinary Frenchman from the provinces largely untouched by the values of the Enlightenment."

Profits could fall to one-third of their level in the 1986 fiscal year that ended June 30, top executives warn.   The culprit, of course, is the strong yen, which has forced up car and truck prices in the United States, the company's most lucrative foreign market, and squeezed profit margins so much that export earnings declined 66 percent last year, according to company officials. But there is no sense of panic in this tightly knit industrial community that was the boyhood home of Ieyasu Tokogawa, the great shogun, or military leader, of 16th century Japan. The Social Contract    Instead, top Toyota executives say they will deal with an increasingly crowded world car market by relying on advanced technology, higher-priced luxury and performance car models and the painstakingly forged social contract between the company and its employees."

''When Larry Tisch saw that, I knew that was one office that would never be used again,'' said J. Ira Harris, a Salomon Brothers director who was with Mr. Tisch at the time.   Mr. Harris was right. The office is still vacant, a symbol of the no-frills, no-nonsense management style that Mr. Tisch, the chairman of the Loews Corporation, brought to the troubled insurance company after it was acquired by Loews. Mr. Tisch, together with his brother, Preston Robert Tisch, and a few top assistants, brought in new management, sorted through the insurer's problems and narrowed its lines of business. The conservative course they set for the company has paid off handsomely in recent years, even while the property-casualty insurance industry went through the wringer."

Gorbachev, the Soviet writer Anatoly Rybakov has promised a literary bombshell for next spring.   It is an explosion he has prepared for 20 years, a major novel set at a critical juncture of the Stalin era in which the dictator himself is a major character, stripped of official myth, falsified history and a 30-year veil of silence.   Even at a time when Moscow's cultural fraternity is abuzz with talk of long-suppressed writings or bold new works appearing in print, the news that Mr. Rybakov's ''The Children of the Arbat'' will appear next year in the literary monthly Druzhba Narodov has come as a sensation.   Of all the forbidden themes of Soviet letters, the terror under Stalin looms foremost, a memory both the Government and many people have preferred to suppress because of the questions it raises about the system.   Though Stalin lurks in literature, plays and films, usually as the nation's leader in World War II, no one has dared offer an unadorned portrait of him."

''They have managed reasonably well in a difficult environment,'' said Sanford L. Margoshes, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''They're muddling along.'' Unocal's problems started when Mr. Pickens, the chairman of the Mesa Petroleum Company, made a run at the company last year. Unocal successfully fought off his takeover attempt in May 1985, but at the cost of taking on a huge debt load - an additional $4.4 billion, bringing total debt to a peak of $5.9 billion - to buy back 40 percent of its shares at a premium.   Several other concerns, including the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and CPC International Inc., have recently initiated expensive stock buyback programs in moves to fend off corporate raiders. Unocal's performance has been closely watched since the Pickens episode by those who wonder how much such companies can afford to pay for their freedom."

But the tax break is a relatively minor consideration these days, when a fur can cost as much as a car. If the price tag for your dream coat is heftier than your bank balance, many stores will gladly extend credit. At the Fur Vault, a chain with a reputation for lower-priced coats, a casual shopper may receive an application for a revolving credit account (with an annual percentage rate of 19.8 percent) without even requesting it. Saks Fifth Avenue offers four deferred payment plans, depending on the amount borrowed: For a loan of $1,500 or less, for example, fur coat buyers pay an annual percentage rate of 9.37 percent and have six months to repay; loans of $10,000 and up carry a 10 percent rate and customers, who must put 10 percent down, have 24 months to pay."

Though still not bursting with energy on most days, the Simex recently showed why it was hailed as a prototype of the time when financial exchanges would be linked across international boundaries 24 hours a day.   Simex's chance to serve as a financial trading link among exchanges that girded the globe occurred when rumors of an imminent discount rate cut in Japan awakened American financial managers in the early morning hours of Oct. 30. Scrambling to protect their exposed financial positions in fixed-income securities and to take advantage of the possibility of an imminent rally in the bond market, money managers turned to Simex, where contracts in financial futures change hands after futures exchanges close in Chicago and before trading opens in London.   For those managers who had already bet that bond prices would drop, the idea was to buy financial futures on the Simex that would gain in value and offset the loss back home if Japan cut its discount rate. Foreign orders helped send trading volume on the two-year-old financial futures market here soaring to a record 17,821 contracts as overseas money managers hedged."

In the process, it will decide when the next presidential elections - the first by direct popular vote since 1960 - will be held, whether a presidential or parliamentary system will be adopted, what role the state should assume in the economy and what - if any - circumstances authorize the armed forces to seize power without violating the constitution."

Uttering thoughts usually considered provocative or worse in the Soviet Union, Jewish immigrants interviewed on the documentary spoke of the ''totalitarian'' system they left, the corruption and black market they had to deal with and the regimentation that marked their social life.   They also spoke of the problems they have encountered in the United States in finding jobs, making friends, wrestling with unfamiliar freedoms, choices, rights, of trading the cradle-to-grave security of the Soviet system for a brutal commercialism, of profound nostalgia for their homeland.   The documentary, called ''The Russians Are Here,'' was made by an Israeli film maker for American public television and first shown in the United States in 1983. It was broadcast on Soviet television Sept. 21, accompanied by a long commentary led by Genrikh Borovik, a journalist and critic who has taken the lead in portraying the ills of American life to Soviet audiences."

Whether the new look will help sell more cheese remains to be seen, and some skeptics wonder whether consumers will even notice the design changes.

Preliminary maneuverings by both sides indicate that the tone of the trial will be testy, with Mr. DeLorean portrayed by his lawyers as a man hounded by government officials on both sides of the Atlantic."

Now these countries claim that they cannot maintain their habits. In an attempt to keep the debtors addicted and to give the illusion that creditors are in perfect health, our financial alchemists have devised a virtual international Ponzi scheme. Here's how it works: If, after 90 days, interest due is not paid, loans must be placed in ''non-accrual status.'' At the same time, these loans are often declared ''non-performing'' and written down. But, to avoid these unpleasantries, banks have taken to rescheduling loans. In addition to reducing the servicing costs and extending the life of old loans, this procedure typically requires creditors to lend new money, which gives debtors the money to pay interest owed on old loans. As a result of these maneuvers, debts grow; loans continue to ''perform'' and are carried on the books at face value; and bank profits are realized."

Fresh data for money supply growth last month attracted more attention than usual, because a recently published summary of a Sept. 23 meeting of monetary policy officials showed they were concerned enough about rapid money supply growth to consider a slight tightening of monetary policy.   ''Growth in the broader money aggregates was stronger than expected, but I don't think it is going to lead to any material change in Fed policy,'' said William Sullivan, senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He said sluggish economic growth and diminished fears of inflation, as shown by declines in precious metal prices and bond yields since Sept. 23, argued against any central bank move to tighten monetary policy and raise short-term interest rates. 'To Rule Out Any Move'   Mr. Sullivan added that growth in the M-2 and M-3 money supply measures is rapid enough ''to rule out any move towards an easing in policy'' and a decline in short-term rates."

''Needless to say, I shall not be silenced or intimidated,'' he said. ''I never expected that ill-meaning quarters would stoop so low in their partisan efforts to besmirch not only my name but that of my family.''   The opening last week of a Justice Department investigation of the accusations against Mr. Enrile, coming at this sensitive moment in Philippine politics, was taken by some Filipinos as a new involvement of the United States Government in their affairs. As Mr. Enrile's challenge has grown, the United States has emphatically restated its support for President Corazon C. Aquino."

Aquino.   The constitution, which was formally presented to the President today, will be put to a nationwide plebiscite in January that is developing into something of a vote of confidence in the Aquino administration.   Once in place, the constitution would end the legal limbo in which Mrs. Aquino placed her administration last March when she scrapped the 1973 charter under which she was elected and declared herself the head of a ''revolutionary government.''   Mrs. Aquino has called the charter the ''framework of the house of democracy that we hope to build.''"

''The general level of brand loyalty has gone down because consumers have become more price sensitive,'' Dr. McCann said. ''Now companies have the data to start measuring it.'' Once companies analyze the information, he said, they can focus sales promotion for a particular area and a particular product with greater effectiveness."

The Post traced the ''disinformation'' plan to a memo written by Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's national security adviser.

Hojatolislam Rafsanjani's remarks appeared to indicate that the Iranian moderates who dealt with the Americans over the arms deal had not been politically damaged by their contact with what Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian leader, customarily refers to as ''the Great Satan.''   If so, the situation would be in marked contrast to that of the early days of the revolution in the fall of 1979, when Islamic fundamentalists seized the American Embassy, causing the fall of the provisional Government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, who was seen as too friendly to the West."

But traders uniformly agreed that the decline would be short-lived, and that prices were likely to remain in a relatively narrow range for some time."

The move was not unexpected, though the magnitude surprised some analysts, and the company hopes the shutdowns will help it to regain a competitive edge in the auto market. The 11 plants account for 10 percent of G.M. production vehicles in North America, but the chairman of G.M., Roger B. Smith, said the remaining plants will become more efficient as its $10 billion modernization plan proceeds. Analysts said the moves should result in a stronger G.M., but warn that G.M. still must make cars that are attractive to consumers, rather than rely on incentive plans to attract buyers.   The auto industry in the United States has been battered in recent years by the wave of imports. At first, American auto makers began producing cars overseas, where costs are lower, but their attentions are now turning back home. But while G.M.'s cutbacks may help the industry, they are a setback for the United Automobile Workers, which has been fighting for job security, and for parts of the country that are still heavily dependent on autos."

A chief scientist in the program said such a ban, one condition the Soviet Union seeks in exchange for sharp reductions in nuclear weapons, would have no significant effect, but Pentagon officials and other scientists said it would be devastating.   Officials have stressed recently that many parts of the program, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, are ready for tests that would be some of the most spectacular of the space age. Effect on Test Bans    Surprisingly, some scientists outside the Government said yesterday that a ban on space testing might speed technical progress if showy demonstrations in orbit were foregone for more exacting ones on earth.   Soviet officials proposed last weekend that all but laboratory research, testing and development of antimissile systems be halted for 10 years."

The program, known officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly as ''Star Wars,'' has already demonstrated that a missile can be attacked with a defensive weapon and that a target can be tracked in space. It has also helped spur scientific and technological advances needed to produce a defensive system.   At the same time, the program has uncovered problems that make the job even more daunting than originally thought. The problems of discriminating real missiles from decoys, of coordinating the whole complex system, of launching its components into space, and of protecting them against an adversary are all proving more difficult than expected."

The family, estimated to contain 8,000 members, is led by King Fahd, 64 years old, a man known in the Arab world for being extremely clever, cunning and alert. Hence the sobriquet, ''the desert hawk,'' which his subjects sometimes apply to him.   King Fahd became the ruler in 1982, with the agreement of senior family members, after his half-brother, the amiable, sports-loving King Khaled, died after a history of heart trouble."

Boesky agreed to pay Uncle Sam a stunning $100 million to settle insider charges against him, both parties thought they had gotten a good deal.   The Government had bagged risk arbitrage's most prominent practitioner on illegal trading and extracted a money penalty that dwarfed any similar sanction on record. It had also secured Mr. Boesky's cooperation, with the prospect of his leading investigators to other, equally prominent wrong-doers on Wall Street.   And for their part, Mr. Boesky and his legal team seemed to feel the financier was getting off relatively well. Whatever the price tag, the settlement left Mr. Boesky, whose net worth is estimated at $200 million, with vast wealth. His agreement to plead to a single felony count seemed to minimize the prospects of prison, and, though barred for life from the brokerage business, he was given him a decent interval to wrap up his affairs. There was a feeling that he was taking his medicine and putting the episode behind him."

That was the patrician Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange from 1930 to 1935, who was convicted of grand larceny in 1938 (for using other people's stock as collateral for his own loans).  This week, Professor Galbraith -who is preparing a lengthy article on the precarious state of today's capital markets for the Atlantic Monthly magazine - was asked to compare the Whitney scandal of old with Ivan Boesky's unfolding misdeeds and to explore the causes and likely repercussions of the current insider trading case. In a discussion with Kyle Crichton, Business Forum editor, Mr. Galbraith, emeritus professor of economics at Harvard University, finds Mr. Boesky's fall less dramatically pleasing than Mr. Whitney's, but is otherwise optimistic that, by dampening the merger wave, the scandal may prove salutary.

Machel, died in a plane crash in South African territory on Oct. 19 that has not yet been explained.

For the last two days, investigators have been seeking records from the merchant banks and brokerage houses that dealt with the companies involved in the struggle for the Scotch whisky giant. Guinness won the protracted fight last April with a $3.8 billion offer, beating a rival bid from the Argyll Group P.L.C.   The Government apparently is examining the sharp run-up in Guinness shares last April. That price surge helped the brewing company win Distillers because both of the competing bids were partly in cash, partly in stock. The Guinness shares jumped from 281 pence on March 13 to 353 pence on April 11, one week before Guinness won control of Distillers."

Some observers even said they detected a certain detachment in Mr. Volcker's performance in the world's mightiest financial job. He had, they said, not engaged in the subtle lobbying that would have signaled his eagerness to remain in power.   Mr. Volcker's departure, in many eyes, would be a sharp blow to confidence in American economic policy making and could lead, among other things, to a run on the dollar.

[ Page 20. ]  A Strategic Role Mexico's difficulties have created concern in Washington, not least because of the country's strategic location. Since World War II, the United States' ability to play an active role in world affairs has been premised on the knowledge that its 1,952-mile border with Mexico was secure. Serious problems in Mexico could force the United States to reassess its strategy and refocus its foreign policy."

''Star Wars'': The Soviet Union and the United States are talking about a commitment to adhere for 10 more years to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. They differ about how to interpret the treaty and how much research would be allowed on the ''Star Wars'' space-based missile defense program. At the Iceland meeting, the Soviet Union said it wanted to limit research on space-based systems to the laboratory. Since then, the Soviet Union has hinted that it may take a more flexible position, and American officials want to follow up these hints. It remains to be seen whether the United States will agree to strict limits. The United States is insisting on the right to interpret the ABM Treaty in a loose way that would allow testing and development of space-based systems. Amerian negotiators of the 1972 treaty do not believe that this loose interpretation is valid. 2. Medium-Range Missiles: In Iceland, the two sides agreed to eliminate all American and Soviet medium-range missiles from Europe. The Soviet Union would be allowed to keep 100 warheads on medium-range missiles in Asia and the United States 100 warheads on medium-range missiles within its own territory.

''It has been a most moving experience,'' said the Bishop, Dr. Graham Leonard, a ranking prelate and a theological conservative who feels that the deposed priest, John Pasco, was disciplined by United States churchmen because he, like the Bishop, is opposed to the ordination of women. Episcopal officials deny this is the reason.   The Bishop's action this month in venturing so far afield to officiate at confirmation services with Father Pasco in a small parish outside Tulsa has aroused rancor on an intercontinental scale."

But before issuing indiscriminate sell orders, remember that your goal should be to strike a deal that makes investment sense as well as tax sense. ''The idea is not necessarily to pay the lowest tax,'' advises Leon M. Nad, national tax partner with Price Waterhouse. ''What you're trying to get is the most gain after taxes.''   With that in mind, consider the implications of the new law. Starting Jan. 1, the top Federal tax rate on long-term capital gains (that is, assets you have held for at least six months and a day) will rise to 28 percent from the current 20 percent. But the tax increase will be sharper for people in lower brackets, who now can pay an effective capital gains rate of as little as 4.4 percent. And by 1988, when many of the provisions of the new bill will be fully phased in, top-bracket investors will be paying a tax of 33 percent on their capital gains."

One of the Arab diplomats, Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon of Iraq, said:   ''On the American side, there was a misunderstanding of signals sent from Iran, while Khomeini and others consider this the biggest victory in the history of their Islamic revolution.''   Instead of dividing the revolutionary regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the furor over secret American arms sales to Iran - and diversions of cash to the Nicaraguan rebels - has provided the Iranian leaders with a new issue to unite their nation against the United States.   Iranian officials have been mocking the United States as a country willing to apologize for past sins and desperate to re-establish contacts. Public Questioning Suppressed The only public questioning in Iran of the wisdom of dealing with the United States, popularly portrayed as the world's greatest Satan, has come from eight members of Parliament, prompted by a group calling itself the Students Following the Line of the Imam, which seized the American Embassy in 1979. Imam is a title given to Ayatollah Khomeini."

He also had, according to the Paris police, some $10 million in stolen jewels stashed in cellars, attics, under floorboards and in safe-deposit boxes. Dubbed the ''King of Fences'' by the press, Mr. Joffo went on trial here this week. His defense: having been deprived of everything by the Nazis as a child, he has an uncontrollable urge to own beautiful and valuable things."

It was Murjani International, his company, that made Gloria Vanderbilt jeans an overnight sensation that has become a $400 million-a-year retail business. It is Murjani that has catapulted Tommy Hilfiger, the young designer, from obscurity to virtual notoriety."

The dollar's sharp fall cut short a recent strengthening that followed renewed optimism about America's economy and a cut in Japan's discount rate.   Soon, says Michael Gaffney, a senior economist for Merrill Lynch, the currency may dip even lower. ''The dollar will probably stay at current levels until United States interest rates fall further,'' said Mr. Gaffney, who expects that to happen shortly. ''We expect the Federal Reserve to cut the discount rate again by the end of the year,'' he said."

The Dow Chemical Company's Ziploc bag commanded more than half of the market for ''reclosable plastic food storage bags'' - the kind with two narrow tracks at the top that pinch shut. And Glad Products was struggling to cut into that lead.   For a year, a team of 20 scientists and engineers working for Glad in Chicago experimented with dozens of colors to put on the tracks of its bags, so that when the tracks were squeezed together, the seal would turn a different color. They finally settled on a combination known to every kindergartner: yellow and blue, which would turn to green. The closure on Ziploc and other brands is clear."

It may be too soon for the Hughes-defined vehicle of the future to be rolling off G.M.'s assembly lines, but the company founded by Howard Hughes 54 years ago has settled under the wing of its new parent much more smoothly than G.M.'s other major acquisition of last year, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation.   H. Ross Perot, the founder of E.D.S., was ousted from G.M.'s board this week after openly criticizing G.M.'s progress in streamlining itself and improving its products. G.M. also bought out his stake in the company for $700 million, a move that brought even more allegations of mismanagement from Mr. Perot. Hughes's Chairman's Views    By contrast, Hughes appears relatively docile. ''Our relationship with G.M. has gotten off to a good start,'' said Allen E.

It is that, and more. The London Stock Exchange not only ended fixed commissions and membership restrictions, as our exchanges did more than a decade ago, but took decisive steps to adapt to the new technological and competitive realities of the world securities markets. If the New York Stock Exchange fails to match the British reforms, it risks losing business, particularly in well-capitalized issues of international interest.  The London exchange dealt decisively with two crucial issues that have not been resolved by the Big Board: the system to be used for the trading of listed securities and the role of stock exchanges in the present era of international securities markets and advanced technology. Consider the American system, and compare it with the new British approach."

Aquino gathered in the rain for a rally meant to revive the popular support that forms her political base.   Huddled under umbrellas in the city's financial district, middle-class women in yellow T-shirts joined in the chant from the election campaign last winter: ''Cory! Cory! Cory!''   And they added a new slogan, ''Give peace a chance.''   These women, who formed the core of Mrs. Aquino's support in ousting the former President, Ferdinand E. Marcos, faced a new challenge in a growing agitation against her Government from the right wing."

DeBartolo Corporation.   In a statement from its headquarters in Chestnut Hill, Mass., General Cinema, which holds one million cumulative preferred shares of Carter Hawley that are convertible into 12.2 million common shares, said, ''General Cinema has no intention of accepting such a proposal if it is, in fact, made.'' Pivotal Role Two Years Ago    The nation's largest film distributor and a major soft-drink bottler, General Cinema played a pivotal role in thwarting The Limited's first run at Carter Hawley two years ago. That bid was defeated by Carter Hawley's repurchase of 15 million of its shares and General Cinema's purchase of the Carter Hawley preferred stock, a move that gained it seven of the 22 seats on Carter Hawley's board."

Boesky, the Wall Street speculator who traded stocks on illegal insider information, will, for all practical purposes, go out of business this Friday, according to Wall Street sources.   In settling charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Nov. 14, Mr. Boesky had been allowed to take up to 18 months to wind down the activities of the $880 million investment partnership he managed.   But, according to several Wall Street executives who have talked with some of Mr. Boesky's employees in recent days, the firm bearing his name will dismiss most of its research and secretarial staff and will cease to have traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange after this Friday. The firm's name and any reference to Mr. Boesky have already been removed from the building directory at 650 Fifth Avenue. Portfolio Transformed    In addition, these sources, who requested anonymity, say the stock portfolio of the investment partnership, Ivan F. Boesky & Company L. P., has been almost entirely transferred into cash-equivalent fixed-income securities for distribution to partners soon."

The $65-a-share tender offer, disclosed in newspaper advertisements today, followed heavy buying of Gillette stock late yesterday. Some Wall Street arbitragers thought the buyer was Ronald O. Perelman, Revlon's chairman.   The arbitragers speculated that Mr. Perelman had bought about $175 million of Gillette stock. This would represent about three million shares, or about 5 percent of the company's 65 million common shares outstanding, at yesterday's closing price of $57.75 a share. They said that the purchases, made through Bear, Stearns & Company, might have been sufficient to raise Mr. Perelman's stake in Gillette to 10 percent."

Col. Oliver L. North, as well as to the company run by a retired general involved in dealings with Iran and the Nicaraguan rebels.   They also show calls to a telephone in Costa Rica that appears to belong to an American intelligence operative.   The telephone calls were from a safe house in El Savador used by American crews secretly flying weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels during a Congressional ban on such aid, and the calls appear to offer the strongest circumstantial evidence so far that there was close coordination between the rebels, Colonel North, American officials in Costa Rica and someone in Stanford Technology Incorporated, of which Gen. Richard V. Secord, retired, is a leading member.   Senior Administration officials had previously contended that the rebel supply operation was ''strictly private'' and therefore did not violate the Congressional ban on delivering arms to the guerrillas. It appears increasingly likely, however, that the program may have been prompted by American officials, financed by secret arms sales to Iran and then monitored by American officials in Central America."

But to achieve that goal, OPEC will have to display a measure of unity, production discipline and political will that the aspiring cartel has often lacked during its 26-year history.

Darman, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, criticized big corporations for being bloated, risk-averse, inefficient and unimaginative and for not spending enough on research and development. Corporate executives were paid too much for doing too little, he suggested. Perhaps the unkindest cut was his likening corporate culture to the Federal Government's bureaucracy.   Whether Mr. Darman was simply being mischievous or defending his role in designing the new tax policy -which will raise the tax bill for much of big business - he caught people's attention. He drew kudos from some unlikely allies, including John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist.   On the other hand, being called ''bloated'' was undoubtedly a surprise to the likes of Chrysler, Exxon and General Electric and dozens of others that have put themselves and thousands of their employees through the wringer in the name of raising their efficiency."

The specialists - Government officials, journalists and scholars, some of whom have worked in Albania - are therefore waiting with considerable anticipation for the congress of the Albanian Communist Party that is to open in Tirana in the first week of November.   Emerging from talks with five of these specialists in Bucharest and Belgrade is a consensus that a key to gauging the freedom of Mr. Alia, the Secretary General of the party, is what happens to Mr. Hoxha's widow, Nexhmije, who is 71 years old.   Mr. Hoxha ruled Albania with an iron fist for 40 years until his death in April 1985.

Despite his efforts, the efforts of bureaucrats who preceded him and perhaps because of the weight of 3,000 years of history, people in China refuse to write Chinese all the same way.   Street signs, billboards, newspapers, books and the signs over shop windows sometimes use forms of Chinese characters that are irregular, obscure or downright wrong.   Last month Peking Daily published two pages of Chinese characters, the ideograms that make up the written Chinese language, and declared that once and for all this was the way Chinese should be written. It was at least the sixth time in the last 25 years that such a list has been published. A Posse of Schoolchildren?  Earlier this year exasperation with the spread of irregular written characters seemed to reach a fever pitch, and schoolchildren were urged to patrol the streets looking for public signs with incorrectly written Chinese as part of a campaign dubbed ''Let the spring wind drive away wrong characters.''"

The opposition group, the Democratic Progressive Party, got an unexpectedly high 23 percent of the vote, more than opposition candidates had received in the past. Political analysts said it was a remarkably good showing over all for a party that was formed two months ago and was still regarded as illegal, although its candidates were allowed to campaign. But the party's successes are not expected to result in any sweeping changes in Taiwan's policies."

The reports from last week's sessions drove open-market oil prices up by roughly $2 a barrel, to more than $16 a barrel. But the production cuts of more than 7 percent for the first six months of next year exclude Iraq.   The Iraqi exclusion underlines the degree to which OPEC decisions are influenced by the six-year war between Iran and Iraq. It also raises doubts about whether the agreement to trim output will be sufficient to defend a price of $18 a barrel."

''Prices were down two points across the board,'' said one official at Interactive Data, a subsidiary of the Chase Manhattan Corporation that evaluates bond prices for various investors.   The quality of the junk bonds held by investors is the same as before, but managers of mutual funds heavily invested in such issues are worried about the effects of unfavorable publicity about Drexel -the Wall Street leader in the trading and selling of such issues - and the junk-bond market. The ultimate result, they fear, could be shareholder redemptions, which could require the funds to sell bonds from their portfolio. A flurry of selling by bond funds, in turn, might depress prices even further, perhaps exacerbating the problem."

But despite the closing of the nation's largest steel producer, there has apparently been little effect on the nation's economy.   To be sure, delivery patterns have been altered and customers have been inconvenienced by being forced to find alternate sources of steel. Still, the ready availability of steel amid the absence of USX - which commanded nearly a fifth of the market in the United States - underscores the dramatic overcapacity in the industry and illustrates anew what many analysts have long contended: There is simply too much steel being made in this country."

That is Diamond Shamrock's request to investors as it continues to weigh an unsolicited $2.03 billion takeover bid from the oilman and corporate raider T. Boone Pickens. Today, the company said it had still not decided on its response but would meet again within a week.   But even before the Pickens bid, the Diamond Shamrock Corporation and William H. Bricker, the company's determined chairman, chief executive and president, had been asking for shareholders' indulgence. Ever since Mr. Bricker transformed the Cleveland chemical company into a Dallas-based oil and gas company in the early 1980's, he has had trouble making the restructuring pay off.   That does not necessarily indicate, however, that Shamrock is interested in being acquired. Early in 1985, for example, the company pulled out of a purchase by the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a deal that some on Wall Street viewed as a good deal for Shamrock, but not for Occidental."

But each rarely crosses that short space to visit the other's home. ''It's like the green line in Beirut separating the Christians and the Moslems,'' said Joan Bingham, an in-law.   The father and his only living son have barely spoken since Barry Sr. announced last Jan. 9 his decision to sell the family's media empire, including The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, the Pulitzer Prize-winning newspapers that had been in the family for nearly 70 years. Barry Jr., who had managed the enterprises for the last 15 years, denounced the sale as ''a betrayal'' and, almost overnight, the Binghams became a public archetype of a family destroyed in a struggle over business.   The year since then has been a period of lingering bitterness, grief and unrepentance. Barry Jr. crossed the lawn on Thursday to bring Christmas presents to his parents, a gesture he described as ''correct.'' The whole family has not gathered for Christmas since 1983, and this year will be no exception."

A thick and very crisp potato chip made by old-fashioned methods in this seaside resort town, Cape Cod Potato Chips are going the way of David's cookies, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Dove Bars and other new versions of traditional snack foods that have recently risen from the ranks of junk food to the status of ''premium'' or ''gourmet'' treats. More Expensive Than Rivals    Like their counterparts in the ice cream, cookie and candy world, Cape Cod Potato Chips cost more than their competitors ($1.49 for a seven-ounce bag compared with, say, $1.29 for an eight-ounce bag of mass-produced potato chips); they are made without chemical additives (just potatoes and oil); and, to many, they taste better.   John O'Shaughnessy, a consumer behavior expert at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, says the chip company is part of a growing coterie of small food entrepreneurs tapping a special pocket of consumers willing and eager to treat themselves to a $2 piece of chocolate or $1.75 ice cream cone.   ''There are a lot of little luxury segments out there,'' Professor O'Shaughnessy said, ''and big manufacturers do not cater to them. They're not big enough.''"

Despite statements soon after the April 26 accident that it involved a reactor design different from Western units, experts are now concluding that Chernobyl in fact has important lessons for all nuclear power plants.   This conclusion is evident in a flurry of recent international conferences and local meetings, in a variety of reports on the accident and in dozens of interviews with reactor safety experts. Governments, the nuclear industry, research laboratories and many other groups are assessing the accident. Deadly Potential Realized    It has long been agreed that nearly all reactors have the theoretical potential, albeit a very low one, for a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl. Now that this potential has been realized in one case, the experts now have more solid ground for worry that such an event could be repeated."

Gorbachev over what was said at Reykjavik has raised new questions about how astutely President Reagan and his advisers conducted the negotiations and how they have characterized them to the public.   The dispute could affect the President's ability to continue dealing credibly with Moscow on arms control and damage his reputation as a political leader at home.   The immediate issue is what he led the Soviet officials there to believe he might agree to: Was it simply the elimination of all intercontinental ballistic missiles, as he and other top Administration officials now say, or did he go further and accept Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to eliminate all strategic nuclear arms, as the Soviet leader and several Administration officials maintain? A Dilemma for Reagan    If Mr. Reagan did agree to the concept of eliminating all long-range nuclear weapons, but denies it, he risks undercutting his credibility in future arms talks with Moscow.   But if he admits it, he runs afoul of most of his own Administration's military advice and faces charges of vacillation and incompetence. These are precisely the accusations he used to make, and made again today, about President Carter's handling of Soviet-American relations."

His remarks brought expressions of ''profound gratitude'' from the Philippine President, who at the outset set the tone for her trip by asking for increased Japanese Government aid and private investment. Japan is the largest supplier of assistance to the Philippines after the United States."

So much has happened in the turbulent history of Nicaraguan-United States relations over the last century and a half that nearly every contemporary episode has its historical parallel. Rarely, however, is the parallel so eerily precise as that between the Hasenfus case and that of two Americans arrested here in 1909 for helping rebels.   ''The similarities are really extraordinary,'' said Oscar Rene Vargas, a historian and former Sandinista official. He said he had privately urged Sandinista leaders to remember the events of 1909 when they decide whether to pardon Mr. Hasenfus."
