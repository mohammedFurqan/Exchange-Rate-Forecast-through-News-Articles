That's $2 billion less and two weeks later than a bid in stock from upstart Worldcom. The original suitor, British Telecommunications, with three board seats and 20 percent of MCI's shares, may now emerge as kingmaker.... An Italian insurer, Generali, made a hostile $9 billion bid for AGF of France, and the Zurich Group agreed to take over B.A.T. Industries' insurance business, creating one of the world's biggest financial services companies....Is accounting's Big Six (only a few years ago it was Big Eight) about to become Big Four? Ernst & Young and KPMG Peat Marwick are expected to announce a merger, although neither would confirm it on Friday. Coopers & Lybrand and Price Waterhouse have already agreed to merge.    MARKETS  Earnings or Expectations?  It has become a mantra on Wall Street: the market is earnings-driven. Actually, it's greed-driven. Or, to put the matter more sophistically, is the existential question reality (earnings) or illusion (expectations thereof)? Compaq Computer reported a 41.6 percent profit increase on Thursday, topping the consensus forecast by 3 cents a share, but the market slashed 6 percent from its share price. The Street wanted more. Ford reached a 52-week high of $50.25 on Monday, beat forecasts with a 64 percent profit gain on Wednesday and saw its share price nibbled; G.M.also had solid earnings but slipped in price. Merck had a 19 percent increase but was a penny below estimates. Traders pushed its shares down 4.5 percent, and it helped grease the skids under the Dow, which finished the week at 7,847.03, off 198.17. Intel reported earnings of 88 cents a share, 3 cents below forecasts, and its shares, too, were pounded, despite news of an ultrafast microprocessor chip that it is developing with Hewlett-Packard. The Nasdaq composite lost 77.18 TK for the week, closing at 1,666.85. But the houses behind all this trading did well. Big profit gains were reported by Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, Travelers, Bear Stearns and other Wall Street firms.    GOLDMAN, SACHS  Teachers for a Day  To be fair, some on Wall Street are taking time off from doing well to do good. Some 2,000 employees of Goldman, Sachs & Company, from secretaries through investment bankers, are serving as teachers for a day in New York City public schools. Besides giving lessons on basic business concepts, they hope to demonstrate to students that successful business people are not that different from them. Andy Derrow, above, skips rope in Inwood. ''In a lot of these neighborhoods the most successful business person is the local drug dealer,'' said Peter Mertens, executive vice president of Junior Achievement of New York, which coordinates the volunteers.    NOBEL LAUREATES  A $1 Million Formula  Since the Bank of Sweden began awarding the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1969, Americans have dominated the list of winners the way the Yankees once dominated the American League. This year Robert C. Merton, right, of the Harvard Business School and Myron S. Scholes, left, a Canadian-born professor emeritus at the Stanford Business School, will share the $1 million award for helping to devise a mathematical formula published in 1973 to answer a simple but seemingly insurmountable problem confronting Wall Street: how to measure the worth of an option? Their solution served as a foundation for today's vast global marketplace.    AUTOS  A Clean, Lean Machine  Toyota beat its rivals -- not only Nissan and Honda, but also Detroit's Big Three and Volkswagen -- in unveiling the world's first gasoline-electric hybrid car. Hiroshi Okuda, Toyota's president, climbs into the car, the Prius, which the company said got as much as 66 miles a gallon during test drives while emitting only half the carbon dioxide of a regular gasoline engine. It will sell for $17,700 in Japan -- a loss leader, since analysts estimate it costs $41,000 to produce each one. Consider the difference an advertising expenditure, they said, as Toyota cloaks itself in the mantle of environmental leader. It may be sold in the United States in about six months, Toyata said.    NEW ORLEANS  The House Goes Bust  New Orleans, whose unofficial motto is ''let the good times roll,'' has rolled snake eyes. Casino gambling, legalized by the Louisiana Legislature in the early 1990's, was to sweeten the city's allure to tourists and challenge Las Vegas and Atlantic City for a piece of the action. But over the last three years, all three downtown riverboat casinos, including the Flamingo, above, have foundered on economic, regulatory and legal difficulties. The city's only land-based casino has folded, too. Analysts cited high taxes on the take -- 18.5 percent, compared with an average of 7 percent elsewhere -- as a chief problem. Hillary Crain, chairman of the State Gaming Control Board, called for ''some creative financing.''    THE ECONOMY  The Taming of Inflation  Retail sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent in September and were revised upward for July and August. That pushed down bond prices on Wednesday, but analysts contended that the gain masked an economy that was actually decelerating. Indeed, the Consumer Price Index for September edged up a less-than-expected two-tenths of 1 percent. Because of inflation's slowdown, Americans who receive Social Security and other Federal benefits will receive an increase of only 2.1 percent in January, the second-smallest since automatic cost-of-living adjustments began in 1975.

In testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan returned to the themes of his famous December ''irrational exuberance'' speech, calling any hopes that the stock market will continue to roar upward at its recent pace unrealistic and warning that inflation remained a looming threat. As usual, he avoided saying definitely whether an interest-rate increase was in the offing, but investors took his remarks to heart and pushed stock and bond prices down.    MORE IS MORE  Buying the Competition  Federal Express struck a deal to expand into trucking and logistics by agreeing to buy Caliber for $2.7 billion, thereby also acquiring RPS, a big competitor in the business-to-business end of the speedy delivery market. One reason Caliber may have looked especially tempting to the generally acquisition-shy Fedex: Like Fedex (but unlike U.P.S.), Caliber is nonunion. . . . Not long ago, the North Fork Bancorporation had a half-dozen branches and a chairman trying to control costs by telling workers to make do with one pen and one pencil apiece. With a deal last week to buy New York Bancorp for $800 million, its ninth acquisition in as many years, North Fork will become the biggest bank on Long Island, and a serious competitor in the retail backyard of the giant New York City banks -- maybe serious enough to get itself bought in turn.    LESS IS MORE  Addition by Subtraction  Fed up with trying to persuade the market that its highly profitable finance arm ought to make its stock worth a lot more, the Ford Motor Company decided to hand over its 80.7 percent stake in Associates First Capital to Ford shareholders. The almost $18 billion spinoff accounts for nearly a third of Ford's market value but less than one-twelfth of its second-quarter profits. . . . Champion International also felt the urge to become a purer play, saying it would sell off roughly a quarter of the company to concentrate on coated papers, unbleached paperboard, softwood timberland and distribution. Analysts said Champion could net about $1.1 billion, including the sale of 325,000 acres of timberland, much of it in the environmentally and politically sensitive Adirondack Park in upstate New York.    TECHNOLOGY STOCKS  Sell on 'Oops,' Buy on Thud  A tale of two losses: On Monday, Silicon Graphics brought investors up short with word that it expected to report a loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30. The market, noting that the company's previous quarter was gangbusters and its competitors in the client-server business are thriving, reacted by hacking a third off its share price. On Tuesday evening, the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices reported an even bigger loss than analysts had been expecting since the company gave warning a month ago. Did the market mind? Not for long. After a rough morning, the stock rallied to close higher and rose again the next day.    SAFETY  Lock and Unload  The stories are heartbreakers: Children find their parents' handgun in the dresser drawer, they play with it and one winds up maimed or dead. Those stories ought to be growing rarer by the end of next year, when the manufacturers of most handguns made in the United States say they will be shipping all new handguns with a child-safety lock. . . . Chrysler continues to be haunted by allegations of defective rear door latches in the 4.1 million of its mini-vans built before 1996. A Federal jury in Charleston, S.C., awarded $262.5 million to the family of a six-year-old boy thrown from a mini-van in a 1994 traffic accident. Chrysler has a program to replace the latches but has not formally recalled the mini-vans. The company says it will appeal the verdict.    CURRENCY UNION  The Euro's Bitter Medicine  Getting Europe's economies synchronized for the introduction of the planned common currency in 1999 is proving painful. Germany's central bank felt compelled to head off any hint of inflation with a surprise interest-rate increase, its first tightening in more than five years, despite slow growth and record unemployment rolls. Five neighboring countries swiftly followed suit. In Italy, the center-left coalition Government of Romano Pradi, struggling to trim its too-big-for-the-Euro budget deficit, found itself cutting social welfare spending too deeply for the Communist Party to tolerate. Loss of the Communists' votes in Parliament brought down the Government.    SOUTHEAST ASIA  Indonesia Calls for Help  Long discredited in geopolitics, the domino theory seems to be reappearing in geofinance. Some of the same pressures that toppled the Thai baht over the summer have since set Indonesia's currency to teetering. Indonesia still has substantial reserves of foreign exchange, but the writing on the wall looked dire enough last week to prompt a request for standby aid from the International Monetary Fund to help stabilize the rupiah. Two more hard-hit currency dominoes, the Malaysian ringgit and Philippine peso, managed gains last week.    ACCUSATIONS  All the Way to the Top?  The senior F.B.I. agent in the investigation of possible fraud at Columbia/HCA, the nation's biggest hospital chain, called what the Government has uncovered so far a ''systematic corporate scheme'' perpetrated by senior executives -- and not an isolated error or aberration. The chain's billing and accounting practices may not ultimately prove to have been criminally improper, analysts said, but at the least, the company's defenses against pending shareholder lawsuits appear badly undermined by the contents of a 75-page affidavit partly unsealed last week. Neither the company nor its battered stock showed much reaction.    COINCIDENCES  There's That Word Again  What's hot, black, caffeinated and seemed to figure in every other headline last week? In politics, the long-running Washington donnybrook over campaign finance flared up when videotapes, shot at the famous White House coffees for high-rolling contributors, materialized belatedly. In Silicon Valley, Sun Microsystems sued Microsoft and threatened to yank its license to use Sun's Java programming language on the assertion that Microsoft had twisted Java into another way to seal the hegemony of its Windows operating system. In media, the editor of The Los Angeles Times, Shelby Coffey 3d, resigned, denying that he was driven out by corporate plans to give marketing executives unprecedented sway in the newsroom. Even in the weather report, a hurricane bearing down on Mexico's coffee country made commodity traders jittery at midweek. The storm devastated the coast but largely spared the crop; by Friday the futures pits had calmed down and so had prices, closing up mere pennies from a week earlier and still far below their May peak.

Analysts and merchants estimated that sales were up a scant 2 to 3 percent from December of last year. This was the third lackluster Christmas season in a row, despite the sterling economy and the wealth-generating gains of the stock market. Analysts said the disappointment underscored the harsh necessity for retailers to come to grips with the season's diminishing value to them. ''It took stores years to learn that Easter had disappeared as a selling holiday,'' said Peter Schaeffer, a retail analyst on Wall Street. ''They have to realize that you can't count on Christmas anymore either.'' And even where sales were strong, profit margins were often weak because of discounting. Economists cited high consumer debt, the diminishing tendency of extended families to gather around the Christmas tree and the simple exhaustion of working couples trying to muster the energy to go to the mall."

If you sold stocks or mutual funds at a gain during the year and are sitting on losses in your portfolio -- in, say, international or Pacific funds that have tanked with the Asian crisis -- a sale before year-end will offset the gain.

''It's a sign of a tremendously strong U.S. economy,'' said Allen Sinai, president of Primark Decision Economics of Boston. The rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point, to 4.7 percent, the lowest since 4.6 percent in October 1973. Most other data also pointed to a robust economy. Retailers reported unexpectedly strong October sales, underscoring the importance of Halloween goods; the Goldman Sachs retail composite index climbed 4.5 percent. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing unexpectedly strengthened in October, and the Conference Board said its index of leading indicators rose two-tenths of a percent in September. Also, personal incomes rose four-tenths of a percent in September, while factory orders rose for the fourth consecutive month. Demand for metals and high technology paced the gain of four-tenths of a percent. Construction spending fell unexpectedly in September, however, posting its biggest drop in almost a year, 1.1 percent.    MARKETS  A Rocky Recovery  Like many convalescents, the stock market had some good days and some bad ones. After being battered the previous week, the Dow Jones industrial average soared 232 points on Monday. By Friday, investors were selling -- reacting, again, to the uncertainties in Southeast Asia, as well as to the specter of inflation raised by the strong jobs data. The blue-chip average ended the week at 7,581.32, up 139.24 for the week. The Nasdaq composite index was up 8.79 at 1,602.40. . . . The New York Stock Exchange plans to drop its controversial rule No. 500, which makes it nearly impossible for a listed company to move to another market voluntarily. Nasdaq officials have long cited it, warning potential defectors that if they went to the Big Board, there would be no turning back.    TAXES  Vox Populi Is Heard  Were L. L. Bean's flannel shirts about to join the tea in Boston Harbor? Their phone lines jammed by angry consumers, mail order companies backed away from an agreement that the Direct Marketing Association had reached with state tax authorities to collect sales taxes. . . . Nor are Federal taxes any more welcome. The House voted by an overwhelming 426 to 4 to rein in the Internal Revenue Service, giving taxpayers new rights and authorizing the creation of a new board made up largely of private citizens to oversee the tax collectors. ''The I.R.S. is too big and too mean,'' said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. The agency is also getting a new boss, who has promised to tame it, as well as to rejuvenate its arthritic computers. The Senate confirmed Charles O. Rossotti, co-founder of American Management Systems, a computer systems and consulting company, as commissioner.    COMPANIES  Levi's Cutoffs  It's not that people finally have enough jeans. It's a matter of competing while paying American workers. Levi Strauss said it would cut a third of its American manufacturing jobs, affecting 6,395 workers and closing 11 factories in four states. But it promised a generous severance package. . . . City officials halted work on Donald J. Trump's $3 billion Riverside South project in Manhattan, below, because of defective concrete. Mr. Trump said the subcontractor that poured it, Laquila/Pinnacle, would have to bear the resultant costs. . . . AT&T is cutting to 3 from 33 the number of long-distance rates paid by residential customers who do not subscribe to a special calling plan. . . . General Electric is cashing in its 13 percent stake in Lockheed Martin for $2.8 billion. . . . Boeing plans to phase out the MD-80 and the MD-90, civilian jets that compete with its 737. Boeing inherited the planes when it acquired McDonnell Douglas.    DEALS  Gambling on ITT  Hilton Hotels raised its hostile bid for control of ITT, only to be countered on Friday with a sweetened offer from Starwood Lodging Trust. Shareholders are to meet on Wednesday. . . . The Justice Department recommended that BellSouth not be allowed to offer long-distance service in South Carolina. . . . Microsoft is close to an agreement to invest up to $1 billion in the cable television operations of U S West, according to several people involved in the negotiations.     PRICES  Ceilings Are Legal  Consumers can shop for that hot new car with less fear of having to pay a premium. The Supreme Court, in one of its most important antitrust decisions in years, ruled unanimously that a manufacturer or supplier does not necessarily violate Federal antitrust law by placing a ceiling on the retail price a dealer can charge for its products. The decision was widely welcomed by manufacturers, notably those in the auto and computer industries, who said it could lead to lower consumer prices. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that it remained illegal for manufacturers to impose minimum prices on dealers.   "

Now Boeing, the leading aerospace manufacturer and the biggest United States exporter, says it will take a charge against earnings of $1.6 billion for the third quarter, resulting in a loss, and a $1 billion charge for the fourth quarter."

A Federal Reserve survey has found what workers already knew: The bulk of the American labor force is not winning sizable wage increases, even as employers are driven to extraordinary lengths to find qualified personnel. Indeed, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate slid to a fresh 24-year low of 4.6 percent in November as payrolls surged. But providing evidence that wage-related inflationary pressures remain largely in check, the Labor Department reported that worker productivity rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter, the best rate in five years, and that unit labor costs fell 0.2 percent. . . . The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its closely watched factory index declined to 54.4 last month, from 56 in October. It was the index's third fall in three months, but still showed a strong economy. . . . The outlook was bolstered by a report from the Conference Board that the index of leading indicators advanced 0.2 percent in October, the sixth consecutive increase."
