About 200 Palestinians were wounded in the violence sweeping the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the death toll rose to at least seven from violence earlier this week. It started after right-wing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon -- a figure of hatred for Palestinians -- visited a site in Jerusalem's Old City on Thursday that is sacred to both Jews and Muslims. Witnesses said Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers opened fire during clashes near a Jewish settlement in Gaza on Saturday, and medical sources said more than 70 Palestinians had been injured in the violence there. Israeli security forces also opened fire in the West Bank city of Nablus when hundreds of Palestinians marched towards an army checkpoint. Witnesses reported three people hurt. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the divided West Bank city of Hebron. Some threw stones and others hurled petrol bombs at Israeli soldiers and at least 60 people were injured. In Jerusalem, Israeli police said Palestinians threw stones at cars and buses and, as a security precaution, police evacuated worshippers from the Western Wall of the Old City where Jews were reciting prayers on the Jewish New Year. Dozens of other people were reported injured in isolated clashes across the West Bank. The Israeli army said it had used live ammunition in Gaza to target people ``endangering soldiers,'' as well as rubber-coated metal bullets and teargas there and elsewhere. ``PROVOCATIVE'' VISIT BY SHARON BLAMED Palestinian leaders had called a one-day general strike in memory of Palestinians killed on Friday during clashes at the Jerusalem holy site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Harim al-Sharif. They blamed the violence on the Israeli authorities' show of force and the ``provocative'' visit by Sharon to the Old City. A total of at least 400 Israelis and Palestinians, and several tourists, have been reported injured so far. The explosion of Arab-Israeli violence soured not only Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Barak's New Year, or Rosh Hashanah, weekend but also his push for lasting peace with the Palestinians. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan telephoned Barak as well as Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Friday. ``He expressed his concern over the recent violence in Jerusalem and urged the leaders to do everything they can to reduce tensions, restore security and continue to work towards a peaceful settlement of the remaining issues that divide them,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. Arafat arrived in Cairo to discuss the violence with Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, a close ally of Washington and president of one of the only two Arab states to have made peace with Israel. Egyptian radio reported Mubarak had issued a statement blaming ``provocative Israeli actions'' for Friday's clashes in Jerusalem, the main stumbling block in the peace process. ``A statement issued by the Egyptian Presidency noted that, at a time when the peace-loving forces were looking forward to a breakthrough in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, they were taken aback by the bloody incidents that too place yesterday (Friday),'' the radio said. SAUDIS BLAME ISRAEL Palestinian Minister Nabil Shaath said he was due to leave on Sunday to meet foreign ministers of Luxembourg, France, Britain, Ireland and Belgium and top European Union officials at Arafat's request to brief them on the bloodshed. Saudi Arabia, another staunch ally of the United States and supporter of Washington's role as Middle East peace broker, put the blame for the violence squarely on Israel. ``Saudi Arabia condemns the brutal assaults inflicted on Palestinian citizens in Jerusalem by Israeli occupation forces,'' the Saudi Press Agency quoted an official statement as saying on Friday night. Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to the world's two main Muslim shrines. Gulf media railed against the ``horrific massacre'' of Palestinians in Jerusalem and one newspaper in Qatar said the killings showed Israel was still the Arabs' foe. ``The events prove that Israel was neither a neighbour nor a peace partner. It is no more than an enemy,'' Al-Sharq's editorial said. In south Lebanon on Saturday, thousands of Palestinian refugees demonstrated against the killings. They marched through Ain el-Hilweh, the biggest refugee camp in Lebanon, chanting anti-Israeli slogans and burning an effigy of Sharon. ``Sharon, we will never forget your massacres in Sabra and Shatila. The Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) is Arab and will remain Arab,'' read one banner. In 1983 an Israeli inquiry found Sharon indirectly responsible for the killing of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut. He was defence minister at the time, during an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Russia called on Palestinians and Israelis to stop further bloodshed from derailing the peace talks. ``Moscow is extremely alarmed,'' a Russian Foreign Ministry statement said on Saturday. ``These tragic events are the consequences of provocative acts in the area of Muslim holy sites on September 28,'' it said in apparent criticism of Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount."

There are 55 dead and about that number of people missing,'' rescue force chief Andreas Kois said Wednesday. Many of the dead were young children, who were not required to be counted on the passenger list. A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after hearing news of the sinking, the coast guard said. Justice Minister Michalis Stathopoulos said the accident was caused by ``criminal negligence,'' and prosecutors ordered the arrest of the ship's captain and four crew members. Coast Guard chief Andreas Sirigos said the 34-year-old ferry boat hit a large rocky outcrop late Tuesday in rough seas about two miles off the popular resort island of Paros. A crew member interviewed by telephone said there was an orderly evacuation. But passengers reported a strong collision and then panic. ``The ship fell apart as it sank. There were people hanging from the railings. Children were crying and old people were screaming,'' Zoe Kolida told private Mega television. ``I jumped in and looked back after about 50 meters and the ship was gone.'' ``I thought of the Titanic,'' another survivor, engineer Stamatis Delavinias, told Mega. ``The boat sank in about half an hour. There were old women and others who were afraid to jump in the sea.'' Dozens of fishing boats, other vessels and British Navy helicopters rushed to the scene and helped in the rescue. The ferry's owner said there were 447 tickets sold and 63 crew members aboard, but the exact number of passengers was not known as some may have purchased their tickets onboard and children under the age of 5 are not required to have tickets. Some reports said at least 20 people from another ship owned by the same company may have boarded the ferry. The head of the Paros Health Center, Dimitris Stavrakis, said ``there a number of young children among the dead.'' A British Navy helicopter in rescue operations touched down at Paros airport and was seen unloading four bodies, including that of an infant. Some survivors taken to other locations, including the nearby island of Antiparos, also said they had not been registered by rescue authorities. It was not known how many foreigners were aboard, but they reportedly included passengers from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and the United States. Coast guard officials were baffled as to why the 345-foot, 4,407-ton Express Samina hit the Portes islet, a large rocky outcrop which is marked on maritime charts and has a navigation light. ``You have to be blind not to see it,'' Sirigos said. ``It is inexplicable how the ship collided with a well-known rock that carries a light visible from a distance of seven miles.'' The accident was even more surprising for a vessel such as the Express Samina, one of more than a dozen ferries that daily sail to Paros and other resorts. The ship's captain Vassilis Yannakis, his lieutenant, Anastasios Psychoyos, and three crew members were arrested. A supreme court prosecutor also summoned two senior officials from the ferry's operator, Minoan Flying Dolphins, to give testimony. The captain of another ferry, Theoharis Tsoukalas, said he made the same run almost every day and could not remember ``any other ship ever hitting there.'' Greek and British warships on maneuvers in the area scoured the area as life rafts and vests washed ashore. Rescue efforts were hampered by a fresh gale with winds blowing up to 46 mph. British helicopters rescued at least 12 people, including two Britons, clinging to rocks in the swelling seas and took them aboard the HMS Invincible for treatment. They were suffering from cold, shock and minor cuts and bruises. Sirigos said 443 people from the ship had been accounted for at the island's health center. He appealed for any survivors staying at hotels or private homes to register at the health center. The ferry makes regularly scheduled runs from the Athens port of Piraeus to the island of Samos with a final stop at the tiny Lipsi islands near the Turkish coast. It was about to make a stop on Paros, 100 miles southeast of Athens, when it hit the reef. Sirigos said the coast guard was also investigating why it took the crew nearly 20 minutes to inform the coast guard that the ship was sinking."

The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs the air traffic system, predicts that by 2010 the number of airline passengers will rise 59 percent, to 1 billion. About 70 percent of that increase will occur at the country's 28 largest airports.    The story of how the nation's air travel system reached its current crisis can be traced back to one of the Government's most successful economic initiatives -- airline deregulation -- and to one of its longest and most expensive bureaucratic blunders: the F.A.A.'s ill-fated attempts to develop a new air traffic control system.

One reason AT&T may want to issue a new stock to track the long-distance unit is that its shares have languished recently. AT&T hit a new 52-week low during trading yesterday and closed at $31.8125, down 31.25 cents. Management is eager to bolster the stock price and believes that issuing a tracking stock might accomplish that if the shrinking consumer long-distance unit was separate. [Page C14.]    E-Signature Bill Is Signed Into Law  President Clinton signed legislation giving legal weight to electronic signatures. At a ceremony in Philadelphia, the president used both the traditional felt-tip pen signature and the more high-technology method of inserting a signature card into a computer. [C3.]    Oracle's President Steps Down  Oracle, the world's second-largest software publisher, said that Raymond Lane, its president and chief opperating officer, had abruptly resigned. Mr. Lane, at Oracle for eight years, had held the post of president since 1996. [C3]    Doctors Seek Antitrust Exemption  Elated with a victory in the House, doctors opened a campaign to persuade the Senate to give them an exemption from antitrust laws so they could bargain collectively with insurance companies over fees and other issues. But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said he would stand in their way. [A1.]    Personal Spending and Income Rise  Consumer spending rose by 0.2 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported, matching expectations. Americans' incomes, which include wages, interest and government benefits, rose 0.4 percent in May, slightly more than expected. [C3.]    2nd-Quarter Slump for Underwriters  The amount raised in the United States by investment banks in stock and bond offerings -- $451 billion -- was down 24 percent from the second quarter of 1999. Fees for underwriting new issues sank about 20 percent from $3.29 billion in the period a year earlier. [C14.]    $765 Million Investment in Italtel  Cisco Systems and the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice agreed to acquire 80 percent of Telecom Italia's computer network equipment unit, Italtel, for $765 million. The two investors hope that by forging an alliance with Cisco and by making the company independent from its Italian parent, it will become more competitive. The investors said they hope to sell shares of the new company to the public soon. [C4.]    Russia Exerts Control Over Gazprom  Russia's government strengthened its influence over Gazprom, the natural gas giant. Shareholders voted in a new board, tipping the balance to favor the government, which controls 38.4 percent of the company. The vote greatly reduced the influence of Gazprom's chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, who had wielded tremendous power. [C2.]    Japan Rescues a Department Store  Japan's Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency charged with overseeing reform in the banking system, said the government would spend 97 billion yen, or $924 million, of taxpayer money to help rescue Sogo, a highly indebted department store. [C2.]    U.S. Markets to Close Early  The stock market and other financial markets in the United States will close at 1 p.m. Monday and be closed on Tuesday in observance of the Fourth of July. Most overseas markets, however, will be open both days. United States markets will reopen on Wednesday.  "

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) agency in the East Timor capital, Dili, said the latest clashes occurred at the refugee camp of Betun, which had been taken over by pro-Jakarta East Timorese militias the previous night. ``The 20 casualties reported have been killed...we have no information so far about the wounded. We don't know whether they are Indonesian citizens or East Timorese,"" UNHCR operations manager for East Timor Bernard Kerblat told reporters. Betun is a stronghold for the militias which razed East Timor after it voted in August, 1999, to end Indonesia's military rule and who fear returning to their homeland, now under U.N. rule. The camp is just south of the West Timor border town of Atambua, where militias butchered three foreign UNHCR workers on Wednesday and mutilated their bodies. FUNERAL MAY HAVE BEEN TRIGGER About 1,000 people attended the funeral in Betun of a militia leader whose murder earlier this week is believed to have triggered Wednesday's violence. ``The funeral was quite tense because the mob, mostly in trucks and motorcycles, roamed the town first, forcing shops to close and residents to stay inside,"" an army intelligence officer said in Atambua. But he denied there had been any clashes. Kerblat said no aid workers were among the latest victims but gave no further information. The United Nations pulled more than 240 workers and dependents out of West Timor after Wednesday's slayings. Indonesia's cabinet spent most of the day on the issue but came up with nothing new to appease international anger over the militias and the murders. ``Indonesia will take wise, fair and realistic steps to seek a permanent solution,"" top security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said afterwards, adding investigations were continuing. President Abdurrahman Wahid did not attend the meeting. He is in New York for a special U.N. summit, where he faced angry world leaders over Wednesday's murders in Atambua. The killings overshadowed the start of the U.N. summit in New York, where a minute's silence was held for the three men from the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Croatia and Ethiopia. At least six West Timorese residents also died in Wednesday's bloodshed and scores of houses were torched. REFUGEES ON THEIR OWN Atambua, about 2,000 km (1,200) miles east of Jakarta, was tense and deserted on Friday with almost no traffic and most residents shut up in their houses, fearing further trouble. The handful of people on the streets were too afraid to speak to visiting journalists, who were also turned away by hotels afraid their presence would bring trouble from the militias. The U.N. withdrawal leaves more than 120,000 East Timorese living in refugee camps in West Timor without any outside help. They were among more than 300,000 people the militias forced across the border from their homes in East Timor in a rampage that followed the territory's independence vote. Indonesian newspapers on Friday condemned the brutality as a national disgrace. The Jakarta Post demanded the military disband the militias it created in a failed bid to swing last year's East Timor vote. ``The Indonesian military, being the chief sponsor of the militias must be made to rein in its proxy soldiers, disarm them and arrest their leaders who have perpetrated the campaign of terror,"" it said in an editorial. And it urged the government to bring the army officers and militias behind last year's bloodshed to trial. ``Surely the government must now realise the shame and disgrace which the Atambua killings have brought on the entire nation is simply too high a price to pay to shield the dozens of murderous generals, colonels, lieutenants and militia leaders from having to appear in court,"" it said. U.S. President Bill Clinton, in New York for the U.N. summit, raised the killings at a Security Council debate on peacekeeping. ``I ask the Indonesian authorities to bring those responsible to justice, to disarm and disband the militias and to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of those continuing to work on humanitarian goals there,"" Clinton said. Authorities have arrested 15 people over Wednesday's murders.

What is Telnet and what can it do? I have Windows 98. Can I use Telnet?    A.  Although it is not used as much as it once was because of the Web, Telnet can still be a good way to connect to other computers from your own machine. It is a text-based system that dates to the 1970's, and some users who are used to point-and-click browsing may find Telnet a bit arcane. If one doesn't mind the old-fashioned interface of typed commands and numbered choices, however, it is a speedy way to connect to systems like online library catalogs and electronic bulletin boards.

The ruling frees Andersen Consulting, with 65,000 employees, from its parent company, which now consists entirely of Arthur Andersen, a tax and auditing firm with 77,000 employees. In exchange, Andersen Consulting will have to give up its name and pay Arthur Andersen $1 billion.

By midmorning Monday, election officials had still not released any official numbers from Sunday's elections, nor had they resumed work suspended the night of the vote. An estimated 74 percent of the country's 7.6 million voters cast ballots for president, parliament and local officials. However, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia party claimed its candidate, 56-year-old Kostunica, had won the presidency, saying its poll watchers reported that he had an absolute majority, defeating Milosevic and three other contenders. ``Votes can be rigged when there is a slim difference between two groups, but when the difference is this big there is no way anyone can falsify the results,'' said Vladan Batic of the opposition alliance. No one in Milosevic's Socialist Party was willing to go on the record, but a senior official requesting anonymity told The Associated Press that the party's ``top people were debating all night ... We don't exactly know what we'll do.'' If no candidate ends up with an absolute majority, a runoff will be held Oct. 8. However, Milosevic was showing no signs of conceding defeat, and Western governments held late night consultations to determine how to respond. The European Union on Monday issued a statement criticizing Milosevic for intimidating voters and manipulating the presidential ballot, declaring that any effort by the Yugoslav leader to declare victory would be ``fraudulent.'' In Vienna, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the chairwoman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in a statement, ``All available information points to a clear lead by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia's Vojislav Kostunica in the first round.'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Monday said ``all the reliable evidence'' shows Milosevic had lost and urged the president to step aside. ``Be honest with your people, don't cheat them, get out of the way and let Serbia get out of the prison into which you have turned it,'' he told a Labor Party conference in London, referring to Yugoslavia's main province. Early in the vote-counting, White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said questions about irregularities brought into question ``the integrity of the whole process.'' Hours later, as reports came out that the opposition -- which the United States backs -- was in the lead, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher in Washington took a softer tone, warning simply that ``the world is watching.'' Believing that there can be no stability in the Balkans as long as Milosevic remains in power, the United States has invested millions in an attempt to organize the traditionally fractured Serbian opposition and defeat Milosevic. Milosevic spokesman Nikola Sainovic, however, claimed that with 20 percent of the votes counted, Milosevic was leading by 44 percent while Kostunica had 41 percent. Kostunica's group, an alliance of 18 parties, claimed returns from 51 percent of 10,000 polling stations showed him leading with 53 percent to 36 percent for Milosevic. The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, which ran its own unsuccessful presidential candidate, said Kostunica was leading Milosevic by 53.5 percent to 37.9 percent with 20 percent of the votes counted. Confident of victory by an opposition that seemed hopelessly fragmented only months ago, huge crowds streamed into the streets of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await official results. Helmeted riot police carrying shields and armed with tear gas cordoned off the group but later withdrew as the mood became more festive than confrontational. Similar gatherings were reported in Nis, Novi Sad, Cacak and several other towns in Serbia. There were no immediate reports of clashes, and the crowds dispersed early Monday. Despite the public euphoria, opposition leaders said they were concerned that Milosevic would try to claim victory -- or ensure a place in the runoff. ``Milosevic has to seriously understand the judgment of history, and he shouldn't gamble any longer,'' said Kostunica's campaign manager, Zoran Djindjic. Montenegro, the smaller republic that along with Serbia forms present-day Yugoslavia, said it would hold an independence referendum if Milosevic wins. If he loses, the European Union has promised Yugoslavia massive aid. Kostunica had been leading in opinion polls -- despite a campaign marred by a crackdown against opposition supporters. The Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a private group including human rights workers, lawyers and other volunteers, reported a turnout of 74.6 percent in Serbia. In Montenegro -- where the pro-Western government boycotted the vote -- the turnout was 24 percent, the opposition said. The center also reported major voting irregularities, including officials kicking opposition representatives out of polling stations or not allowing them to inspect voters' lists, voting boxes and ballots. The government's electoral commission said the vote passed without irregularities, ``despite Western propaganda.''"

ETA, in a communique published in the radical separatist newspaper Gara, said it bombed a Basque discotheque earlier this month because it considered the nightclub a centre of drug trafficking. ETA accused police of turning a blind eye to the illegal drug trade that it said ``hurts Basque youth and goes against the process of liberating the Basque Country.'' The communique was released just a day after the killing of a town councillor in a Barcelona suburb, the latest attack blamed on the guerrillas. ETA did not immediately claim responsibility for Thursday's assassination -- it rarely does until weeks later. But with Friday's communique, ETA has now admitted to 12 of the 13 killings tied to ETA this year since it called off its 14-month-long ceasefire last December. The guerrillas have been blamed for about 800 deaths in their 32-year fight for an independent state in northern Spain and southern France."
