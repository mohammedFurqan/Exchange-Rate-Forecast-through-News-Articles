The most important consequence was that Washington and Tokyo narrowly avoided the outbreak of a nasty trade war. Beyond that, the latest trade dispute is likely to be remembered for yielding only modest changes. President Clinton settled for an agreement that requires far less change in Japanese business practices than his Administration had vowed to achieve. Doubts were already arising withing the Japanese Government over whether the ""victory"" in the trade talks claimed by some officials would prove all that secure. The economic debate over just how protectionist Japan is continues despite the settlement of the auto trade dispute.

When House and Senate budget panels approved plans last week to balance the budget in seven years, the main sticking point was tax cuts -- the House wants $350 billion in cuts, the Senate none. They'll have to hash that out if, as expected, the bills pass this week. But then would come the messy part: figuring out specific cuts, not just simple numbers. How bad will the pain be? It's a numbers game. Some estimates put it at 7 percent or more from overall spending. But since Social Security and the military are off limits, cuts in things like education and the environment could be more like 30 percent. That's pain. COMMUNICATIONS  MCI Joins Murdoch's Team  Rupert Murdoch is on a roll. He just got the F.C.C. off his back on the thorny issue of foreign ownership of American TV stations. Then last week MCI said it would invest up to $2 billion in his News Corporation. The new partners' talk was full of grand global plans, of ""synergies"" -- and these two companies do indeed have a history of rattling all sorts of cages. But analysts saw a coup for Mr. Murdoch, questioning those vaunted synergies. After all, even if MCI eventually owns 13.5 percent of the company, the deal gives it no true voting power. And on the news, MCI's stock fell and the News Corporation's rose. So what's in it for MCI? Clearly, a possibility of fulfilling global dreams that go beyond long distance.  REAL ESTATE  What Went Bankrupt?  It really comes down to two questions: 1) Come on, how could Rockefeller Center possibly be bankrupt? 2) Oh, does it really matter? To tackle No. 2 first, it was best summed up by a candy-store worker, right in the belly of the Midtown beast, who responded to a query about last week's Chapter 11 filing this way: ""Truthfully, sir, I have no idea what you're talking about."" As for No. 1, let's see: The family took out a huge mortgage. A Japanese company bought 80 percent of the center, paying too much. Rents fell when they were supposed to rise. And somehow, with all sorts of overlapping companies called Rockefeller Group, Rockefeller Center Properties, RCP Associates, things just stopped adding up. Is that clear now? WORK FORCE  Women Pay Their Way  Not long ago, if a woman had a job, it was often for little extras -- not the meat of a family budget. Well, in case you hadn't noticed, that world is long gone. If any doubts persisted, they were dispelled by a survey released last week that showed that more than half of employed women provided at least half of their household income. The study ""challenges the persistent notion that women's earnings are supplemental,"" said Arlene Johnson of the Families and Work Institute, co-sponsor of the survey. Not that all women want to be breadwinners -- 31 percent said that if money were abundant, they'd be tending to their families, while just 21 percent of men stated that preference. And some women, of course, have no choice -- the men aren't around. MARKETS  Emerging Is as Emerging Does  It was a noble idea, fairly oozing with pioneer spirit. Three years ago the American Stock Exchange decided to give a break to some little companies that didn't quite fit the mold but that, it hoped, had boundless futures. Last week the Amex ended the experiment, called the Emerging Company Marketplace, saying no new companies would be added. Not only did some of the companies fail to emerge, but nearly a quarter of them are now worthless. The tales behind the companies range from the blatant (one's largest shareholder was a convicted arsonist) to the bizarre (another's chairman had been sued by the S.E.C., but had since had a sex-change operation). But the lesson seemed to be that there is, after all, a reason for an exchange to have rigorous rules for membership. Or simply this: Emerge first, then apply.  ANNUAL REPORTS  The Pepsi Investor Next Door  Pity the designers of annual reports. They're duty-bound to put heavy machinery or cereal boxes on the covers -- but don't want to make them so dull-looking that stockholders will quickly toss them. Why, they must wonder occasionally, can't they put some glamorous model on the cover? No, what a silly idea, they surely say, as they switch off their daydreams and try to think good thoughts about tractors. But apparently someone at Pepsi had that very daydream -- and forgot to wake up. And so it is that Pepsi's just-released annual report could easily be mistaken for Glamour or Vogue -- there's Cindy Crawford gazing seductively out at you -- without a soda can in sight. The cover line: ""A typical investor looks us over."" Sure, Pepsi, sure.  RIVALRIES  From Cold War to Cola War  Who says there are no superpower rivalries left? Even with the cold war over, Coke and Pepsi are still engaged in their mythic battle for the gullets of the masses. And even if Pepsi scored one for having the sexiest annual report, Coke caught the Presidential eye in Russia last week. Mr. Clinton, picking an American investment to publicize by bestowing a visit, chose a Coke plant near Moscow. There was a reasonable political explanation: Coke owns its Russian plant, while Pepsi's is a joint venture. But could it be because Coke has contributed more to Democrats lately? Or maybe Mr. Clinton, weary of vodka, craved a soda -- and figured the Coke plant was the nearest place to get a free one. It was, after all, right on the way to the airport. TRANSPORTATION  You Could Always Walk  In a single century, a historical speck, we've gotten used to the odd notion that if we want to be 30 miles away in half an hour, we should be able to do it -- no matter what damage is done to the environment. Now, as the world struggles to retain that luxury, someone had the bright idea of mandating a certain number of electric cars by 1998 -- a down payment on a pristine new world of travel. But is it possible? Practical hurdles still loom, of course -- but there's more: now comes a study saying that emissions from mining and smelting the lead needed for batteries might cause their own nasty threats to public health. But what of the argument that at least pollution would be shifted away from cities? Not so, said one toxicologist; ""lead particles can move long distances."" SOUVENIRS  23! 45! 23! Oh, Never Mind  Does Michael Jordan realize he is tampering with some basic elements of our economic system? A basketball uniform is merely a piece of cloth, but with a star's number on it, it becomes a glowing -- and pricey -- symbol of all that's glamorous. So when he picked No. 45 for his comeback, a huge industry instantly took shape -- caps, T-shirts, banners, you name it. So when he abandoned that number last week for his old 23, he demolished the value of all that stuff. It was as if Calvin Klein decided to change his name to, say, Oliver North. All those people strutting around town in their Calvin underwear would feel, well, a bit cheated. No wonder the N.B.A. fined Jordan's team for the switch; Jordan upset a delicate balance of capitalism."

Another list synopsizes the 123 letters that have made it into print -- including the one bashing Pete Rose, another defending Italian Fascists against charges of anti-Semitism, a third making his argument against the need to floss daily. On a third list, he tracks the success of others whose great passion is writing letters to editors."

It was finally time to reveal all that I had so jealously guarded to the two people who represented the continuity of life in my family: my two sons.

Investors often look for the group with the best record in domestic equities, and for good reason. Diversified funds that buy domestic stocks are the cornerstone of long-term portfolios, and their returns are much more variable than those of bond and money market funds.   To find out which fund group does best, analysts at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago funds research company, reviewed the domestic stock lineups of all the fund companies large enough to qualify as fund supermarkets. They started with the 20 largest in assets and then removed five -- Federated, Janus, Kemper, Prudential and Scudder -- because of limited product offerings."

The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.72, up from 6.61 percent on Thursday and 6.53 percent at the beginning of the week.   Some analysts said the rumor might have served as an excuse for investors to sell in a market that has run too far, too fast on anticipation that the economy will continue to slow. No one saw the trading as a sign of a major new direction in the market.  [ Page 36. ] The stock market turned sour, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 34.58 points to 4,423.99, as traders saw further evidence of an economic slowdown but without the prospects of a cut in interest rates that would help lift sagging corporate earnings. The traders were so troubled by the outlook that they ignored surprisingly good news on the inflation front. For the week the Dow was down 20.4 points.  [ 37. ] Share prices plunged in Tokyo to the lowest level in nearly three years, amid discouragement over the economic outlook and the Government's rescue plan for the banking industry. The Nikkei fell 398.12 points, or 2.6 percent, to 15,044.18, its lowest close since Aug. 19, 1992. The latest development to pull down stocks was the release of the central bank's quarterly survey of Japanese business sentiment, which found that businesses had become more optimistic, despite the strong yen. That seemed to depress the market, analysts said, because it would deter the central bank from cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy.  [ 34. ] The dollar dropped sharply on a rumor that large Japanese investors were selling United States securities. It recovered much of the loss as traders concluded the rumor was groundless.  [ 42. ] Producer Prices Flat, With No Sign of Inflation  Inflation at the producer level disappeared again in May, reflecting the slowing economy, as price declines for food and energy products offset increases for other types of finished goods, Government figures showed.  [ 36. ] Tokyo Rejects Iran Embargo  The Japanese Government has told Washington it will refuse to join the embargo on trade with Iran, undercutting the Administration's effort to isolate Teheran economically for its sponsorship of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons.  [ 1. ] Lotus's Employees Cautioned  Lotus Development has directed employees not to buy or sell shares in the company until the board has announced its position on I.B.M.'s takeover offer.  [ 35. ] Microsoft Damns the Torpedoes  Despite a Justice Department investigation, Microsoft said it had no intention of altering its plans for entering the computer on-line services business in August.  [ 35. ]   A Rockefeller Center Roadblock  A Federal bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by Rockefeller Center Properties, the real estate investment trust that holds a $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center, to wrest control of the property from its bankrupt owners.  [ 46. ] ITT Completes Sale of Units  ITT said it had agreed to sell the remaining portions of its ITT Financial subsidiary for about $5.5 billion, completing a process it announced in September.  [ 35. ] Steinway Agent Raided in Japan  Raiders from Japan's Fair Trade Commission confiscated documents at the Tokyo offices of the local sales agent of Steinway & Sons, on suspicion that the agent had prevented rivals from importing pianos made by the New York company.  [ 34. ] Books From Rock and Roll  Brian Roylance and his Genesis Publications are turning from facsimiles of classic novels and historic documents to rock and roll, preparing to sell limited editions of books by George Harrison and Eric Clapton and about the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix. The books sell for hundreds of dollars each.  [ 11. ]"

Wells Rich, a unit of the BDDP Group, said on April 12 that David R. Sklaver, president of Wells Rich Greene BDDP Advertising, and Tom Fagan, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Wells Rich, had used the $500,000 to invest in ""a new production company facility"" and in turn ""personally received stock in that company.""

A company is prudent, tucks a few billion away for a rainy day and what does it get? Well, just look. Chrysler, recalling past woes, socked $7 billion away, but then Kirk Kerkorian, already Chrysler's biggest shareholder with 10 percent of its stock, said he and Lee Iacocca wanted to buy the whole thing -- in a huge $22.8 billion deal. Not only that, but he wants to reach in and use $5.5 billion of that company nest egg as part of the down payment. If he's just trying to get the share price up, he succeeded, as the stock rose $9.50 in a day. And if he really wants to own it, he's betting big that Chrysler won't need that money. If he's right, he may get more billions; how wonderful for him. But if he's wrong? Few people care if a multibillionaire loses a billion, but it's not just Mr. Kerkorian's gamble. If Chrysler dances on the precipice again, lots of innocent bystanders will pay.  AIRLINES  Continental Scraps Its Diet  Purists may see it as justice for using that mangled spelling, but the demise of Continental Lite last week was more the failure of an idea that some say was doomed from the start. Not that low-fare ""airlines within airlines"" can never work -- United's doing fine with its West Coast shuttle. But Continental's attempt to go lo-cal -- sorry, low-cal -- just never worked. Too many planes were added too quickly, resulting in lots of repairs -- and lots of canceled flights. So the airline, after losing $140 million on the experiment, scrapped it. The logos on 100 planes will be painted over, the first-class seats brought back -- and no more peanuts, or ""peanuts fares."" So, like the waistline of an erratic dieter, fares go up, fares go down. Someday maybe the airlines will get it right.  MARKETING  Happy Birthday Dear Blunder  Do you suppose that Ford Motor, 10 years after offering the Edsel to a resoundingly ungrateful public, celebrated that fiasco's anniversary? Not likely. But, hey, this is the 90's -- everything's upside down. So it was that Coke, far from being red-faced a decade after the ""new Coke"" follies, last week actually celebrated the anniversary of that too-sweet marketing blunder. Maybe, as Pepsi unsweetly suggested, Coke was just ""trying to put the right spin"" on the inevitable anniversary stories. But then again, as Coke's chairman, Roberto Goizueta, pointed out, the company's market value has grown from $9 billion to $75 billion in that decade. New Coke -- which Mr. Goizueta, by the way, decided to introduce -- has not exactly hurt.

Mr. Trump, a tireless collector of ""trophies,"" bought the Plaza in 1988 -- with borrowed money -- and then borrowed even more on it to help him buy Eastern Airlines, among other things. This house of loans tottered in 1992, with Citibank and other banks winding up the true owners -- and Mr. Trump a 51 percent owner in name only. The banks wanted out, and last week buyers were found -- a Saudi prince (the same one who put big money in Citicorp a few years back) and a Singapore company. The price: $325 million (Mr. Trump had paid $400 million). Eloise, at last report, was cowering in a closet. CURRENCY  A Little Dollar That Wouldn't  You'd think that if everyone wanted to stop the dollar from falling in value against the yen, something could be done. But forces greater than mere governments are clearly at work here, for even though both Washington and Tokyo want to even things out, the dollar stays weak -- it now buys just 83 yen, compared with 100 in January. Just last week Japan -- its goods becoming awfully costly on world markets -- offered an emergency rescue plan, including a cut in its discount rate to an unheard-of 1 percent. It also moved to promote imports and cut regulations to whittle away at its trade deficit -- seen as the main culprit. To no avail. Exchange rates barely budged, and Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. Back to the drawing boards. LEGALITIES  His Appeal Was Not Insane  At the 1993 sentencing hearing, the judge in the Crazy Eddie case said his goal from the start had been to redress the wrongs resulting from ""the fraudulent activities of this defendant"" -- Eddie Antar, that is. Irate as he may have been at one of the largest stock frauds ever, that's not the way a judge should talk. At least that's what a Federal appeals panel ruled last week as it overturned Mr. Antar's stock fraud and racketeering convictions, saying the judge had shown prejudice. Mr. Antar may now face a new trial on charges that he inflated the price of Crazy Eddie stock in the 80's. THE ECONOMY  Inflation Made at the Fed  It really becomes a chicken-and-egg problem: Which came first -- Federal Reserve interest-rate increases or inflation? Yes, the Fed kept saying it was lifting rates to keep inflation nice and cool. But a funny thing turned up in the price figures last week. Yes, inflation was still in check -- producer prices were up just 0.1 percent, consumer prices just 0.2 percent. But where did a big part of that 0.2 percent come from? Directly from the Fed -- its rate increases have driven up automobile finance charges by a third in the past year. And -- surprise! -- that drove transportation costs up far faster than the overall rate.  RESTAURANTS  The Day the Smoke Cleared  ""Excruciating and bothersome"" -- one can easily imagine such words being uttered by a nonsmoker who felt an enjoyable meal had been ruined by someone else's cigarette smoke. But last week it was a smoker voicing that sentiment, as a strict New York law went into effect that bars smoking in most city restaurants. It's ""part of the whole Big Brother thing,"" said another smoker. Restaurant owners are worried -- and, in some cases, poorer. One spent $40,000 for renovations to comply with the law. But is it all fair? Smokers, of course, can smoke on the sidewalk. Then again, nonsmokers could always eat on the sidewalk.  TAXES  No Discount on Boardwalk, Yet  Parker Brothers is having a high old time celebrating Monopoly's 60th anniversary. Here's the latest: After calculating that that pesky $75 ""luxury tax"" would now, in New Jersey, be $2,746.27, it proceeded to catch today's tax-cut fever. At a ceremony in New York tomorrow -- tax day, of course -- Parker is scrapping the luxury tax for the whole anniversary year. Now if the I.R.S. would just let you pass ""Go"" a few extra times . . ."

Yeltsin has decreed a halt to all combat in the breakaway region of Chechnya, beginning Friday, while dozens of Western leaders are in Moscow for V-E Day.   The four-month-old war, which many critics in Russia and abroad have called needlessly brutal and prolonged, has practically leveled the regional capital of Grozny, and several other Chechen cities and towns. President Clinton, although at first hesitant to condemn the Russian military action in Chechnya, almost decided not to participate in the ceremonies in Moscow marking the Allied victory in Europe in May because he did not want to seem supportive of the Russian action."

Prudential Securities' projected cost for the debacle involving sales of limited partnerships has grown to more than $1.4 billion, executives at the firm said yesterday, far more than the $1.1 billion the firm expected to pay as recently as July.

As of last Friday, court records show, the firm had made offers to settle tens of thousands of claims to the compensation fund for almost $750 million. Nearly 80,000 investors have already accepted offers of settlement from the fund, the records show."

Last year the Big Three auto companies -- Chrysler, the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation -- reported combined profits of more than $14 billion, a record high. Though sales prospects have slipped somewhat recently, most forecasters are still expecting a good year, with total vehicle sales of more than 15 million cars and light trucks."

Thanks, but I'd Rather Be Hit By a Car","  When The Times asked readers about their bad bosses, by E-mail and snail mail the stories of wrongdoing rolled in: phone-smashing bosses, Jabba-the-Hut bosses, even fire-'em-in-their-hospital-beds bosses. Here, stories from some of our outraged correspondents.   There are some things they never teach you in law school. During his first Christmas season after graduation, Ralph Hummel, a lawyer in Huntington, L.I., got an unusual assignment from his boss. It wasn't a chance to work on a big case. It was a chance for Mr. Hummel to use his own car to carry the boss's Christmas tree. Shades of Scrooge and Cratchit dancing in his head, Mr. Hummel asked why. The boss's reply: ""Well, you wouldn't want the tree to scratch my Mercedes, would you?""   At the time, getting hit by a car didn't seem like a great idea. But in retrospect, Barbara Zapson says maybe it all worked out for the best. The accident, which caused a hairline fracture of her spine, happened one July after Ms. Zapson, a New Yorker, had been working for years as an executive assistant in a large company.   ""My boss never called, never sent flowers or even a card,"" she writes. But on the third day after the accident, a Friday, he called to ask if she'd be in on Monday. He already knew, of course, that the doctors said Ms. Zapson needed six weeks of bed rest. But the boss said he couldn't do without her. For eight days she worked out of her home. And when she returned to the office, it was with a promise from the boss that his chauffeur would pick her up and drive her home to spare her the rigors of mass transit.    When she came to the office, the boss told her he had good news and bad news. The bad news was that she had used up all her sick leave and now owed him five days. Next, he said that it was no longer convenient for her to use the chauffeur. The good news was that if she gave up her vacation in August, he wouldn't dock her salary.    Ms. Zapson promptly quit. The boss followed her into the street, begging her to come back, telling her he'd give her anything she wanted. She asked to work 9 to 5. ""Done,"" he said. She asked him to pay for cabs for the next four weeks. ""Done,"" he said. When she asked for her vacation, he said, ""Impossible."" Ms. Zapson said goodbye.   Her P.S.: ""For the past three years, I'm happily enjoying the best job and best boss I've ever had!""   Bosses with tempers? P.H. says, ""I actually had a boss at a German bank who once had it written in his contract that he could smash only a certain number of phones per month. What that number was I never found out. Other than that, he wasn't such a bad fellow.""   F.J.D. has a number of fond memories of his boss. One of them concerns a salesman who fell from a ladder while decorating his house for the holidays. From his hospital bed, the injured man read F.J.D. a short note from the boss, informing the poor fellow he was being dismissed. That, of course, was the bad news. The good news was the boss's chirpy closer: ""Get well soon.""   ""It is always an unwelcome surprise to wake up one day and find that you are working for Jabba the Hut,"" is the way Don Mennie, of Mendham, N.J., begins his account of woe. Stretching the limits of his physical endurance, he was commuting 160 miles a day to a technical writing job. On a snowy Friday in March, Mr. Mennie called ahead to say his arrival for the weekly staff meeting might be delayed. When he arrived 15 minutes late, the boss was in a snit.    ""I was called on the carpet and accused of every imaginable misdeed. My work output was insulted, and I was put on a humiliating 'probation,' which was supposed to run three months while I 'improved my computer skills.' It lasted only about a week."" Despite praise from others within the company, Mr. Mennie was told to resign or be terminated.   During his last days with the company, Mr. Mennie discovered that the boss had recruited an old crony, desperate and unemployed, to take his job, and the sham of probation was designed to insure that there were no gaps in the work flow while the deal was made.   Mr. Mennie concludes with these observations: ""Forget snipers in the post office. Don't get excited about nerve gas in the subways. For most people, this scenario is what workplace terrorism is really all about today.""   Not all bad bosses are found in the corporate office. One New York woman, M. L. Maiscott, says, ""My worst boss was a mother superior I had when I was in the convent many years ago."" The mother superior was paranoid, and after complaints from the parents in the school where Ms. Maiscott taught, the mother superior was reassigned.   And not all bad-boss stories have unhappy endings. ""Since I left the religious life the same day she went to her new post,"" Ms. Maiscott writes, ""I heard only later about the fireworks set off from the convent roof by the nuns who, cheering, watched her car drive off.""    With a nod toward ""A Visit From St. Nicholas"" comes this memorial to bad bosses from a poet who prefers anonymity.:   ""Good morning,"" she started, ""You all look so happy!   I don't want to waste time, so I'll just make it snappy.   With Hay points and re-orgs I have you confused,   So you can't fight my policy changes,"" she schmoozed.   ""You'll get sick no longer, 'cause that's just a ruse.   If your kid's in the hospital, it's vacation you'll use.   Your benefits, too, will be cut, I might add.   The good times are over, and that makes me glad.""   ""Forget about service, or doing what you should.   I think everything's fine if the numbers look good!   Reputation on paper is vital to me;   The actual product's just fodder, you see.   Well, now that I've solved the morale problems here,""   It's time to move on, that's perfectly clear.""   Then, as she waved goodbye and threw us a rose,   She said, ""I love you all!"" and our salaries froze!   She went off in search of her next job with glee,    Always ahead of the fallout is she.   With overtime banned, it was time we went home,   Defeated, downtrodden and numb to the bone.   The ride to the lobby was as quiet as before,   Just one day at work, nothing less, nothing more.   And we heard her exclaim, and so matter of fact,   ""This place might be ruined, but my ego's intact."" Late to Work? Let Us Know!    You were helping an old woman cross the street, eh?

It's a Big Net Earner,"THE Small Business Administration is one of many excellent programs under attack by the new Republican Congress. Some, like Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who is a Presidential contender, want to abolish it. But the logic for eliminating one of the most cost-effective programs in United States history is hard to find.  Where else can you get such a huge return on investment with almost no risk? For every dollar that the S.B.A.'s core lending plan, the 504 program, costs taxpayers, $200 is generated in private capital to finance new businesses and create jobs -- 350,000 of them since the program started in 1981. Meanwhile, 90 percent of S.B.A. loans stay current. The default rate is 1 percent."

The companies, which own utilities in more than one state, contend that the 1935 law, called the Public Utility Holding Company Act, has left them at a legal disadvantage as the rest of the utility industry prepares for a more competitive future."

The proposal by the California Public Utilities Commission would allow long-distance providers and cable television operators to compete with Pacific Bell and GTE for a $6 billion market.   Several states -- including New York, Michigan and Illinois -- have allowed new competitors into their local markets. But the regional Bell operating companies retain key marketing advantages over their new rivals; for example, they can force customers to change telephone numbers to switch to a competing carrier. Such loopholes would be largely scrapped under California's plan."

The agency issued proposed guidelines for patenting software embodied in computer hardware or disks. The agency has traditionally equated software with mathematical algorithms and other thought processes that cannot be patented.   Last summer and fall, however, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that several spurned software inventors deserved patents after all because their programming was an integral part of computer hardware."

The agency had called the meeting to assess what it said was new evidence that implants caused dire and incurable connective tissue diseases like lupus and scleroderma.   Dr. Sergent said he arrived at the session in Bethesda, Md., prepared to conclude that the implants posed a danger to women's health. ""My belief was that there must be something to it,"" he said. But he was surprised to find that there were no scientific data, like broad studies of population groups linking the implants to the diseases. All he heard were anecdotes -- case histories that in themselves proved nothing, though they could suggest hypotheses that could be tested by science."

Gear Inc., the athletic apparel and footwear company, said yesterday that it had terminated a merger agreement with Ryka Inc., a Massachusetts-based marketer of women's athletic shoes. L.A. Gear, based in Santa Monica, Calif., attributed the deal's collapse to Ryka's recent financial results for 1994 and its short-term outlook. L.A. Gear reached its agreement to acquire Ryka in January, but in early April, Ryka sought to renegotiate the merger terms so it could receive short-term financing to help it meet a severe cash shortage. At the time, Ryka, which was founded by Sheri Poe, said that if it could not revise its deal with L.A. Gear, the merger agreement could be terminated."

Of course not. Seventeen experts will get out calculators and show, with mathematical certainty, 17 different evaluations -- which just might be linked to those experts' politics. And so it was when the House passed its tax cuts last week -- triumphantly waving the Contract With America. Republicans pointed proudly to cuts that bulged to 4.4 percent for the middle class and trickled down to 2.9 percent for the wealthy, while Democrats complained that the wealthy would get an outsized share of the cuts. Yes, both were probably right. But more to the point: the Senate is likely to have different ideas, and a Clinton veto looms if it doesn't. In any case, can the nation really afford a tax cut now? In a poll, 55 percent of Americans said no. ENTERTAINMENT  Mr. Bronfman Goes Hollywood  The lure of Hollywood is powerful, and laden with risk. Sony found that out, losing billions on Columbia Pictures. And Matsushita found it out in its stormy ownership of MCA. But Edgar Bronfman Jr. of Seagram wants to try his hand anyway, agreeing last week to buy 80 percent of MCA from Matsushita. The deal involves some big reshuffling of corporate money -- Seagram's getting the cash by selling most of its Du Pont stake for $8.8 billion -- as well as marking a big shift by Seagram, from drinks to entertainment. And it will undoubtedly involve some big reshuffling in Hollywood, for MCA is likely to lose Lew Wasserman, its 82-year-old chairman, and it's unlikely that Steven Spielberg would keep providing the studio with his golden touch.  ADVERTISING  Where There's Smoke . . .  Cigarette ads on television are illegal, of course -- have been for two decades. It couldn't be clearer. Or could it? If a sports arena advertises cigarettes to fans, and the camera lingers on those ads, does that constitute television advertising? The Justice Department says it does -- though arenas and stadiums are loaded with such ads -- and last week it settled its first lawsuit to close that loophole, as Madison Square Garden agreed to keep the offending ads out of camera range. The Garden called the deal a ""formality,"" since it had removed tobacco signs in November. But the agreement sends a clear signal to other sports sites. Just days later came word that the Marlboro sign at Shea Stadium would be moved to be less visible to cameras. TRANSPORTATION  Taxing Interstate Tickets  Taxes. Everywhere you go, taxes. And now, if where you go is across state lines by public transportation -- yes, another tax. It used to be that states didn't tax interstate tickets -- the Supreme Court apparently barred that in 1948. But last week the Court said no, that was different -- New York wanted then to tax a bus company's gross receipts. Now it says the ticket price itself is fair game as long as the trip originates in the state -- that way there's no danger of taxing a company twice for the same ticket. But the question is whether states, no matter how starved for cash, would want to take the political heat for levying what would undoubtedly be an unpopular tax. For passengers, not transportation companies, would be hit hardest.  COMMUNICATIONS  Whatever You Say, Mr. McCaw  Craig McCaw had a lot of money burning a hole in his pocket after selling his company to AT&T, and he knows a lot about wireless communications. Nextel, once a high flier in that very field, was badly in need of an investor. So last week, in a marriage that both surely hope was made in technology heaven, Mr. McCaw said he and his family would invest $300 million now -- and perhaps $1.1 billion over six years -- in the struggling company. The deal: Nextel would scrap its effort to build a nationwide cellular network -- ""been there,"" said Mr. McCaw, ""done that"" -- and focus on private dispatch networks, like those for truck or taxi fleets. Nextel's stock sold for a quarter of what it did in the fall before jumping on this news; for $1 billion, it would probably have gone into the diaper business. BANKING  Adding Up Chase's Parts  In banking, bigger is better, right? Consumer banking, corporate business, global lending -- adding up to a strong, diverse business. That's what giants like Chase Manhattan believe, and Chase is doing fine at it -- its profits growing steadily. But some investors like things simple and easy to size up. If something looks muddled, they want to break it into bite-size pieces -- parts, they bet, worth more than the whole. That's clearly what's happening at Chase. Last week a money manager named Michael Price -- known for pushing to wring all the value he can out of companies -- said he'd bought 6.1 percent of Chase, and the stock shot up 10 percent.  THE ECONOMY  Too Hard a Landing? What gives? The markets like signs that the economy's slowing to a nice even pace, and most of the week the Dow industrials bumped to new highs for that very reason. But when word came Friday that the unemployment rate had reversed course and risen to 5.5 percent -- a sure sign of slowing -- stocks retreated, with the Dow ending up off 12 after being off 36 earlier. Could things be slowing too much? Manufacturing lost a lot of jobs, and total payroll jobs rose just 203,000. ""We can kiss the soft landing goodbye,"" said one economist. But the Administration was more upbeat -- it needs that soft landing badly -- as Labor Secretary Reich saw the economy in a steady ""glide pattern.""  AIR POLLUTION  Smog? Cars Have It for Dinner  Forget ""zero emission"" vehicles, the lab-coat name for electric cars. The latest answer to foul air is a ""negative emission"" car. No, there's no Mobius strip of a tailpipe, twisted in on itself and spewing exhaust into some Star Trek-style parallel universe. Well, not exactly. Last week Engelhard, which developed catalytic converters in the 70's, came up with a way for cars to, essentially, devour any smog in their path. A new catalyst would break down existing smog, or ozone, into breathable oxygen -- but would do nothing for the car's own exhaust. Sound far-fetched? The stock market didn't think so, as Engelhard stock jumped 30 percent in a day, and futures prices for platinum -- a key part of the process -- hit a four-year high. An unanswered question: after it eats all Los Angeles smog, will it eat Los Angeles too?  GEOGRAPHY  Take a Left at the Berlin Wall  Be realistic. With national boundaries sometimes seeming to shift by the day, with countries born and countries dying, no one could possibly keep up. You could easily forget that a faraway place called the Soviet Union had, well, gone through some changes. So Dow Jones should certainly not be faulted for featuring, on its just-released '94 annual report, a globe with these words: Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."

Its cover showed a strikingly cool model in a black beaded dress with a single cover line: ""Enter the Era of Elegance.""   It was a dramatic entrance by Ms. Tilberis, the former editor in chief of British Vogue, into the high-stakes world of American fashion, a land of smoke and mirrors where image is often worth its weight in reality. Her mission was to turn around the moribund 125-year-old Harper's Bazaar, once the doyenne of American fashion magazines, which was in its eighth year of a downward spiral in advertising pages."

This year's bull market, the strongest surge since late 1990, has been powered by lower interest rates and rising corporate profits. It has already added more than twice as much to the wealth of America's households as all the money families painstakingly salted away in savings last year.   So now that signs of an economic slowdown are multiplying, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is acknowledging the possibility of a brief downturn this summer, and anxiety is starting to well up, shouldn't all that freshly minted wealth help make the economy safe from recession?   Maybe, but don't count on it. When it comes to the fortune of someone like William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, or the outlook for specific companies, the stock market is a powerful force. But when it comes to determining the course of the overall economy, it is still just a bit player."

By October 1991, however, the securities in the partnership had been ravaged by losses in rapid-fire trading, and Ms. Manion-Fleming was left with just $24,000. No problem, said the investment adviser, International Market Strategies; give us five years, and we'll win back your principal. She did; they aren't. In January, she and other partnership investors filed a joint complaint to get their money back from the brokerage firm that did the trades.   THE BROKER: Consolidated Financial Investments Inc. of St. Louis, which executed many of the trades described in the complaint before the National Association of Securities Dealers. Alan Stiffelman, a Consolidated officer, said his firm is an innocent that just followed the instructions of a money manager not affiliated with Consolidated.   THE STATUS: The N.A.S.D. has yet to assign a hearing date. The plaintiffs' lawyer is considering suing the investment adviser, who is not an N.A.S.D. member, separately.   THE LESSON: Don't believe financial advisers who promise you can never lose more than a certain percentage of your money. Such a claim is only meaningful when there's a bond to back them up. And if their trading causes huge losses, don't believe any promise that they'll make it all up to you in further trading. Get that claim in writing, then ship it off to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to your state securities regulators so they can determine if the promise amounted to fraud.   TO hear Alan Stiffelman tell the story, it's a case of devious investors looking to rip off a brokerage firm after the market turned against them. All his firm did, he said, was execute trades ordered by International Marketing Strategies, manager of the investment partnership the investors had joined.   ""This is the slimiest thing I've ever seen,"" said Mr. Stiffelman, branch manager of Consolidated Financial Investments Inc. ""These people are completely in outer space,"" he said of a group of eight customers who filed a claim against him and his firm.    Mr. Stiffelman is ranting over the arbitration complaint, filed in January, against him and Consolidated and against Cutter & Company, another brokerage firm in St. Louis.  Gary Ross, a former employee of both Consolidated and Cutter and a principal in St. Louis-based I.M.S., was also named. Mr. Stiffelman says the customers knew exactly what was going on -- he sent detailed statements to them as well as to I.M.S. -- and that they didn't complain at the start, when the accounts were making money.   Only when the accounts began losing money, he said, did the investors squawk. He said he did not know the particulars of their I.M.S. agreement but acknowledged there had been heavy trading in the accounts.   Sharon Manion-Fleming, one of the plaintiffs, was a 23-year-old widow pursuing her bachelor of arts degree at Maryville University in Chesterfield, Mo., when she became an I.M.S. customer in 1990.   The $169,000 she invested with I.M.S. came from an insurance settlement after her husband's death in a car accident in 1988. I.M.S., which used Consolidated as a broker for her trades, said she would get income about equal to that of the John Hancock bond fund she had been in, Ms. Manion-Fleming recalled. The stocks, Treasury bills and options in her account would be traded within the structure of an investment partnership managed by I.M.S.   ""They said it was virtually risk-free,"" she said of the strategy outlined by I.M.S. ""I couldn't afford to lose more than 10 percent of my money, and they guaranteed in writing that no more than 10 percent of the principal could ever be lost.""   Gary Hamby, who, along with Mr. Ross, was a principal of I.M.S. at the time, has no telephone listing at the home address given in his regulatory record. Mr. Ross did not return telephone calls to his home. The St. Louis telephone number on file with the S.E.C. for I.M.S. is no longer in service. Even the accountants who compiled I.M.S.'s financial statements are bewildered: ""I can't find them now,"" said Jay Logsdon of Maher, Sabino & Associates in St. Louis. ""They left me holding the bag"" on some bills, too, he said.   In January 1992, just two months after the complaint says Mr. Hamby told the plaintiffs their accounts were virtually drained, Mr. Ross was hired as a broker at Consolidated, where he remained until February 1993, according to regulatory records. Before Consolidated, Mr. Ross had been a broker at Cutter & Company of Chesterfield, Mo., for about a year and a half. Cutter also did trades for customers of I.M.S., according to the complaint.   Ms. Manion-Fleming said that after I.M.S. had lost all but $24,000 of her money, its officers ""put together an agreement in which they promised to rebuild our accounts over a five-year period."" Believing she would be made whole and receive monthly payments of $1,400 for 5 years, she signed a document giving I.M.S. five years to recoup her principal, in part by investing in zero-coupon bonds. ""At the time, not knowing any better, it seemed like it would work,"" she said.   No such luck. After months went by with no payments, Ms. Manion-Fleming and the other investors hired Investors Arbitration Services, in Woodland Hills, Calif., to file their arbitration complaint. I.A.S., which advertises its investor-friendly assistance in securities arbitration in local and national media, filed the claim with the N.A.S.D. but then ""was stalling on our case and not putting much effort into it,"" she said, adding that telephone calls to the company would often go unreturned.   In February, the investors transferred the case to a St. Louis lawyer. Word from Carol Dubow, president of I.A.S.: ""It surprises me"" that any I.A.S. customer would complain of not having calls returned.   Ms. Manion-Fleming said their lawyer is now trying to retrieve at least part of the group's $25,000 retainer to I.A.S. -- her portion: $4,000.  But she isn't holding her breath for that, or any other restitution, after learning too many investment lessons the hard way.   Are you involved in a dispute between a broker and an investor?

That initial offer caused protests by VEB,  a shareholders organization, and by Jaap Kroonenberg, a real estate broker who owns a 33 percent stake in Orco. They said the price was less than Orco was worth. ABN Amro said it had raised its bid because Orco's interest income and proceeds from its bond portfolio had risen.

That means the sun may soon set on the potted palms at Chase Manhattan Plaza near Wall Street -- and on the careers of thousands of the bankers whose offices they adorn.   Yesterday, Chase said it had hired Tandon Capital Associates, which has helped half a dozen banks cut spending and eliminate 15 to 25 percent of their jobs. Chase said it hoped to exceed its previously announced goal of reducing annual expenses by $400 million a year, 9 percent of its total.    Tandon Capital, a seven-member firm headed by Chandrika K. Tandon, a former consultant at McKinsey & Company, specializes in getting bank employees to recommend ways that their jobs can be streamlined and frills can be cut. These ideas have ranged from reducing the paperwork needed to open accounts to eliminating company-provided plants and the jobs of the people who water them.    Most of the costs eliminated, however, tend to be salaries. Last year, for example, the Tandon firm helped the Fleet Financial Group of Providence, R.I., develop a plan to eliminate 25 percent of its 20,000 jobs.    And yesterday, the Republic New York Corporation, the parent of Republic National Bank and Republic Bank for Savings, said that over the last four months, Tandon ran a cost-cutting campaign that would lead it to lay off 850 people, representing 15 percent of its work force.   Chase, a sprawling international banking company with 35,000 employees, is far more complex than the regional banking companies that Tandon has worked with in the past. Nonetheless, the firm's method is expected to be the same. Ms. Tandon will occupy an office near that of Chase's chairman, Thomas G. Labrecque, and she will lead several dozen top executives in seven-day-a-week, 16-hour-a-day cost-cutting marathons.    ""We want to be as efficient a company as there is in this business,"" said Arjun Mathrani, the chief financial officer at Chase. He said the bank had chosen Tandon because of its bold, intensive approach. ""We wanted to do this in a way that is highly concentrated so it doesn't extend over a long period of time,"" he added.   Chase is starting to organize its executives into teams, which will measure the costs of its existing businesses and then recommend improvements. All employees will be asked for efficiency ideas. By the end of this year, bank executives will select the ideas to be used, with all of the savings achieved by March 1997.   Mr. Mathrani declined to specify how many jobs would be eliminated or how much money would be saved, as Tandon's method is to push bank employees to think of the maximum possible cutbacks.   ""I have no idea how this will play out, but there will be some head-count reduction, no doubt about it,"" he said.   Chase has been trying to cut its costs for more than a year, but the pressure increased last month when the activist investor Michael F. Price bought 6.1 percent of Chase's stock and called on it to make radical changes. Mr. Mathrani said, however, that Chase began speaking to Tandon in January.    Republic, by contrast, already has a reputation of being one of the leanest banks in the country. Nonetheless, it was driven to cut deeper because of new, more efficient, competitors.    ""We recognized that we were not able to mach the low delivery costs of the Charles Schwabs and Fidelitys of the world,"" said Walter H. Weiner, chairman of Republic.   He said the bank, which has never had such a wave of layoffs, would offer severance pay that was much greater than the industry norm. For example, employees with more than 20 years at the bank will be paid for five years, in declining amounts, if they do not find other work.   The severance package and other costs of the campaign will cause Republic to take a $120 million pretax charge against earnings in the second quarter. The program is expected to eventually cut $75 million a year from pretax expenses.   At Republic, Tandon asked employees for suggestions on what processes could be streamlined or eliminated. Of the bank's 5,500 employees, 70 percent submitted ideas. The 21,000 suggestions were pared to 3,000 proposals for the bank's top management, and 2,000 were approved.   As a result of the process, the company will deliver management information on computer screens, rather than paper printouts. And it will cut the number of bankers who must approve certain loans from five to three.   All Republic employees had to describe their work functions in blocks of 5 percent of their time. As various functions were dropped, assignments were rearranged so that entire positions could be eliminated.   Republic rejected some of the suggestions, like raising the deductibles on insurance policies, as too risky. And it chose not to consider moving operations outside New York City.   Unlike Fleet, Republic decided to keep its corporate coffee service.  ""We would be sending people into the neighborhood to get coffee,"" Mr. Weiner said. ""And when they came back carrying coffee cups, they would spill it all over our carpets.""   But the company will no longer pay anyone to water its plants.   ""We think that it takes very little time for people to water their own plants,"" Mr. Weiner said."

The domestic film industry generated more than $5.4 billion in ticket sales last year, while licensing income from merchandising tie-ins to films and animated characters surpassed $17 billion, according to Karen B. Raugust of The Licensing Letter. ""The Bridges of madison County,"" by Robert James Waller, is a hugely successful book, with more than six million copies sold, and has been on the best-seller list for almost three years. Perhaps inevitably, the book and the film version have generated a not-so-small cottage industry of their own. TY AHMAN-TAYLOR COST: $14.95 PRINTED: 6 million in the U.S.  MARKETED BY: Warner Brooks 1 -- THE MOVIE BASED ON THE BOOK The movie has taken in more than $36.4 million, with an average of 3,420 per screen, which is more than either ""Casper"" or ""Braveheart."" Caryn James, in a review for The New York Times, said the film ""benefits from several choices that preserve the book's essential appeal - its dreamy surface and pedestrian moral - while minimizing its syrupy qualities."" Plans are under way for videotape release later in the year. COST: $8 a ticket in New York TO DATE: $36.4 million MARKETED BY: Warner Bros. Films 2 -- THE BOOK BASED ON THE MOVIE BASED ON THE BOOK This book features photographs taken by Ken Regan during the film's production and tells the film's story in pictures with snippets of large-type text. Like the movie, this book is broken down into four one-day segments. COST: $22.95 PRINTED: 80,000 MARKETED BY: Warner Books 3 -- THE BOOK BASED ON THE CAMERA IN THE MOVIE At several points in the film, Clint Eastwood, playing a photographer, snaps pictures of bridges and other scenery. Given that the on-screen cameras he used actually had film, and the film was actually developed, and was in focus, which is not the easiest task while directing and acting, a merchandising opportunity was set into motion. The book features photos as they were taken with snippets of text. It is mostly blank pages and is intended as a journal. COST: $11.95 PRINTED: 70,000 MARKETED BY: Warner Books 4 -- THE COMPACT DISK FROM THE MOVIE The disk features a song composed by Clint Eastwood in addition to several jazz standards that are heard on a transistor radio in the film. The Eastwood song, ""Doe Eyes,"" is heard several times in the film. COST: $15.95 NUMBERED PURCHASED: More than 250,000 since May 20 MARKETED BY: Warner Bros. records 5 -- THE PERFUME LINKED TO THE MOVIE The perfume is but one of the several ancillary products linked to the film. Warner Bros. has licenced tote bags, polo shirts and other apparel, a cookbook and picture frames with the Bridges imprint While the film is not the size-large merchandising blitz that accompanied ""Batman Forever,"" with its numerous commercial tie-ins, the initial book and film have also increased visitors to Madison County in Iowa.

The computer giant made a very out-of-character hostile bid to acquire the Lotus Development Company for $3.3 billion. Lotus had received previous buyout overtures, but I.B.M. cleared the table with its offer, pretty much announcing that despite its staid image, it too can play hard ball in a competitive world. I.B.M., you may recall, used to be the top seller of personal computers, but no more. Lotus was tops in the spreadsheet market, but no more. But Lotus is No. 1 with Lotus Notes, its networking software, and that's what has brought I.B.M. to the door. First place, I.B.M. figures, is the only place to be. Wall Street  Happy Days Are Here Again Hostile takeovers. Kind of gives you the warm and fuzzies about the grand old '80's. It turns out that some investors aren't just settling for that warm glow, but are trying to grab all they can get, or at least get away with. The S.E.C. says it is investigating as many insider trading cases now as it did since the 1980's. As one offical put it, ""It's a growth industry."" It got bigger last week. Lotus stock jumped 89 percent on Monday after I.B.M. announced its bid. The thing is, some of the people who owned the stock, or its options, had just bought on the Friday before. Very insightful. Or very illegal, depending on the quality of your lawyer. Wasn't there something else that made the 1980's so grand? Oh, yes. Many of the insider traders were caught. Brewing More Than a Deal Over Beer The Belgian brewer Interbrew agreed last week to buy the Canadian brewing company, John Labatt, for $2.9 billion. Labatt had been fighting a hostile offer from the Onex Corporation since last month and had talked to several brewing companies about making a friendly offer. Interbrew got the nod. But the deal is for more than just beer. Although Labatt is Canada's second-largest brewer after the Molson Companies, it has interests in the Sports Network and the Discovery Channel and has stakes in the Toronto Blue Jays, Toronto Argonauts and the Skydome stadium in Toronto. Canadian law will force Interbrew to sell the cable channels, but no word yet on what happens to the sports assets. The Brussels Blue Jays does have a nice ring. New York Racing Through the Economy We've heard of economic development zones to spur the economy. We've heard of tax breaks to lure big employers. But can driving faster drive the economy? That's what Gov. George E. Pataki of New York said on Tuesday when he voted to raise the speed limit to 65-miles-per-hour on 1,100 miles of the state's highways. He said the new speed limit, which goes into effect Aug. 1, will help improve the economy and tourism by moving people and goods along more quickly. He presumably meant around the state, not out of it. So, step on it. As a way to generate revenue, it sure beats raising taxes. Unless, of course, it has absolutely no effect. The Workplace It Keeps Going, and Going ...  Los Angeles County estimates that the O.J. Simpson trial has cost the county $4,986,167 so far, and it's still going like the Energizer Bunny. That's nothing. An outfit in Chicago reported last week that the trial has cost the United States economy $27.6 billion in lost productivity. The Cambridge Human Resource Group figured that we all spend about five minutes of each work day talking about the trial. The outplacement and career management company arrived at its figure by plugging that five minutes into the gross domestic product. The company did not do the corresponding math of how much we cost our employers by talking about our kids, the NBA playoffs, or even about our cranky bosses, who just love to attach dollar signs to all the time we spend goofing off. The Economy  Recession? Big Deal O.K., who let that cold breeze in here? Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, put a bit of a chill on the markets when he told bankers in Seattle on Wednesday that the economy may indeed slip into a recession, but if so, it would be brief. The markets took that to mean that the Fed has no intention of lowering interest rates anytime soon, and pushed both stocks and bonds lower. The Dow industrials spent the rest of the week shedding about 60 points and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped from about 6.50 percent to 6.72 percent. Traders continue to be worried that the slowing economy will squeeze corporte earnings, which will just get worse without a rate cut. Anytime Mr. Greenspan wants to close that window, it would be fine with Wall Street. Entertainment A Divorce Before the Marriage Michael Ovitz is not going to run MCA for its new owner, the Seagram Company, in what must be the biggest surprise to come out of Hollywood since ""The Crying Game."" Surprise plot twists are a mainstay of Holloywood, but few people predicted this one. Hollywood insiders had said that the talks to lure Mr. Ovitz, chairman of the Creative Artists Agency, had gone on for weeks, but fell apart over the issue of money and independence. Usually, if you have a lot of one, you have the other, but Seagram balked at giving away too much of both. No word yet of who will eventually run MCA. The chairman of Seagram, Edgar Bronfman Jr., says he's going to spend time to learn MCA's business before making his next move. Why does that sound so groundbreaking? Employment Get a Job, Pretty Please Low unemployment has its good points, but many areas of the South have managed to find the negatives. Unemployment is so low in many urban areas around the Southeast that some restaurants, hotels and grocery stores cannot find enough workers to fill low-wage jobs. It's easy to figure out what happens then. Employers get needy and those low wages suddenly get higher. Some employers have had to raise wages from 20 to 25 percent and still can't find enough workers. In a bizarre twist, the Opryland Hotel in Nashville has brought in about 300 workers from Puerto Rico and bought a former Quality Inn motel for them to live in. Sometimes, supply and demand work together in very strange ways. Air-Sea Rescue No, He Couldn't Call for Pizza When Capt. Scott O'Grady came out of the Bosnian woods Thursday morning, the downed pilot was gripping his pistol. Holding the gun probably made him feel better, but what saved him was a 28-ounce piece of equipment called the PRC-112, his air-survival radio. He used it to send a signal that told everyone he was still around and used it to direct his rescue. It did everything but cook him dinner. So how do you get one? You can't. It is made by Motorola at its Scottsdale, Ariz., operation exclusively for the military. These radios have been around since the early 1980's and pilots carried them during the Gulf War. A bit bigger than a cellular phone, it operates on a lithium battery and fits nicely into the pocket of a flight suit. In an understatement, a spokesman for Motorola said the folks in Scottsdale were very proud of their role. Maybe the captain will give them a call."

A Skadden partner played a role in advising Gov. Thomas R. Carper, a Democrat, to remove a Supreme Court judge who had ruled against one of the firm's clients, the New York financier Ronald O. Perelman. Moreover, several current and former members of the firm have close ties with the Governor or are serving in his administration.

It offered no further explanation."

At least 200,000 of Haiti's 3.5 million registered voters were still waiting today to cast their ballots for parliamentary, mayoral and municipal council seats, but election officials were unable to say when that would happen. Officials acknowledged that some polling stations were still without ballots and other voting materials that should have been delivered last week."

But Morgan Stanley & Company knows the route all too well. The fanciest firm in finance, Morgan Stanley is embroiled in a messy lawsuit that boils down to one simple question: Who is to blame when state investment funds embrace risk and lose big -- the brokers who became rich on the state business or the state itself. The case, to be decided shortly by the State Supreme Court, has implications for Orange County, Calif., and other municipal finance calamities.   The case here began in 1983, when Kathryn M. Lester, a young secretary-turned-trader, was put in charge of West Virginia's $2.2 billion municipal investment fund. Supervising her were a flock of politically connected bosses, several of whom ended up discredited or in jail. Her formal training was in home economics, but with a mind for numbers and a stomach for aggressive trades, Ms. Lester quickly turned the sleepy fund into the most successful in the nation. She made billion-dollar bets and earned millions for her state, displaying a ""Working Girl"" savvy in her wheelings and dealings."

But the slings and arrows of outrageous Republicans proved too painful, and last week the President hummed a radically new tune. O.K., balance it, he said, but do it in 10 years, not 7. His formula: save on Medicare, but not as drastically as the Republicans want; cut taxes for the middle class, not the wealthy; cut welfare, but protect children. But the question remains: Will any of the grand formulas being tossed out in the current political frenzy actually stick for 7 or 10 long years? As one lawmaker put it: if you don't like the President's stance on a given issue, just ""wait a few weeks."" AUTOS  Fiery Voice at the U.A.W.  When Stephen Yokich first picketed G.M., he was in a stroller. He was, after all, just 22 months old; his mother, a G.M. worker, was pushing. That was in the late 30's, a hot time for union battles. Cut to the 90's: automation, Japanese cars, an economy manically reinventing itself, fading memories of union power. United Auto Workers membership has slumped from 1.5 million in 1979 to perhaps 800,000 today. Mr. Yokich, now 59, wants to change that -- and he just might. Last week he was elected U.A.W. president, and hopes are high that he can bring vigor -- and members -- to the struggling union. He's got a fiery resume -- he was, for one, behind last fall's strike in Flint, Mich., which rippled through plants nationwide. But he's also known as a realist, one who can cooperate with management when the handwriting's on the assembly line. SOFT DRINKS  A Cola With Snob Appeal  It's a time-honored marketing tactic: put some bows and ribbons on it, call it ""premium"" or ""luxury,"" and double the price. Look at ""gold"" cards, which quack pretty much like humbler pieces of plastic. Look at Lexuses, which look a lot like Camrys with gold earrings. And now comes -- take a deep breath -- ""Royal Crown Draft Premium Cola."" It's ""rich and smooth,"" the company says, ""with a long-lasting head."" It comes in beer-style bottles. ""We're inventing a whole new category,"" Royal Crown's president said. And, yes, a whole new price: up to $4.99 a six-pack. Actually, given the huffing and puffing of the great ""cola wars,"" it's a wonder no one has thought up the ""premium"" angle before.  DRUGS  The Menopause Market  Menopause has clearly arrived as a hot topic. Why? Because all those baby boomers are hitting the relevant age, of course; out of sight, out of mind. And, yes, it's a hot business topic too, as drug makers hover hungrily at the gates to this life passage. So when news came last week -- from The New England Journal of Medicine, of course -- that estrogen therapy lifts the breast-cancer risk by at least 30 percent, drug makers watched carefully. Many experts say the cancer risk is more than offset by estrogen's protection against osteoporosis and heart disease -- a view sure to be embraced by American Home Products, which last year sold nearly $1 billion worth of Premarin, the leading estrogen. It gets complicated, though, for Merck is nearing the market -- a market that will bulge in a few years -- with a drug that treats osteoporosis without hormones. For women caught in this vise, this means the added assault of marketers confusing them even more.  MEN AT WORK  Father? What's a Father?  At the risk of sounding like a greeting card: What is a father? (This being His Day, you were naturally wondering this, weren't you?) Don't get soppy or philosophical, though; we're talking statistics, just statistics -- offered by Catalyst, a research group aimed at helping women in business. Does Dad bring home the bacon to two children and stay-at-home, slipper-bearing Mom? A mere 3.1 percent of families fit this cuddly mold in 1993. Fully 10 percent of American husbands are ""designated homemakers"" (no relation, presumably, to designated hitters), up from 2 percent in 1986. And among households with working parents, those headed by single fathers are increasing fastest. Still, Child magazine, which tracked ""father-friendly"" companies in 1992, stopped the next year because so few qualified -- or even cared. O.K., back to the football game (or whatever season it is). CYBERSPACE  Between Consenting Computers  On the Senate floor last week, Jim Exon of Nebraska waved a blue binder with a red label reading ""Caution."" Mr. Exon was shocked to find this ""disgusting material"" on the Internet, and he and most of the rest of the Senate don't want your children to see it. (Don't ask how many senators sneaked a peek.) So they did what lawmakers tend to do -- voted to impose fines and prison terms on those who distribute ""filthy"" material over computer networks. A worthy sentiment, surely -- and the lopsided 84-16 vote reflects a distinct fear of being seen as ""pro-filth"" -- but the whole free-speech issue lurks awfully close by. Cyberspace has created an odd new mix of public and private, and private communication between adults has always been sacred territory. Even Orrin Hatch, that pillar of conservatism, denounced the measure, saying, ""It's a political exercise, and I'm against it."" THE MILITARY  Let Them Eat Missiles  Starting in the early 80's -- you remember, when we didn't worry about spending money we didn't have -- this nation spent more than $35 billion on a ""Star Wars"" missile defense, with little to show for it. So you'd think those Republicans hell-bent on balancing the Federal checkbook would apply their austerity here, too -- especially with the cold war over. But no -- even while slashing everywhere else, the House last week added $628 million to the anti-missile allotment. The rationale: the cold war's end means greater risks of missiles from rogue nations, and thus more need for that fabled ""missile shield."" If, that is, it works. POSTAL SERVICE  Moving New York's Mail  Good news, New Yorkers: those 17 catalogues and 14 credit-card offers that are jammed daily into your mailbox are arriving a bit faster this year. (Oh, yes, the real mail is, too -- when you can find it amid the junk.) The Postal Service said last week that New York no longer languishes at the bottom of the nation's big-city mailbag in on-time delivery -- with 83 percent of mail arriving punctually, up from 62 percent last year. Westchester is another matter, though -- the county's mail service ranks second from the bottom nationally, with only San Juan, P.R., below it.  MERGERS  I.B.M.-Lotus: Teamwork?  So I.B.M. buys Lotus. What does it get for its $3.5 billion? Clearly, what it hopes to create, with Lotus's Notes software, is a team powerful enough to play in Microsoft's league. But that will be a disjointed team indeed if, as promised, Lotus remains a private enclave within Giant Blue. Louis Gerstner, I.B.M. chairman, is all for a big, solid front. But with separate sales forces and software teams, ""there is simply no way,"" one business professor said, that I.B.M. can ""make this deal pay off."" So the surprising independence granted Lotus managers may soon be in name only. . . . Microsoft, meanwhile, got some good news. An antitrust deal it cut with the Justice Department had been tossed out in court, but a Federal appeals court reinstated it -- and took the judge who'd rejected it off the case."

The company, which already makes 59 percent of its home game machines outside Japan, will contract with factories in other Asian countries and plans to move production there by the end of next year, a Sega spokeswoman, Misao Hibi, said on Thursday.          She said the Japanese yen's rise of about 15 percent against many other currencies this year had made production in Japan more expensive relative to other countries. Last month, Sega introduced its newest machine, the Saturn, in  the United States. Sega, Japan's largest maker of arcade games and its second-largest home computer game maker behind the Nintendo Company, said it also planned to try to move production of arcade games overseas.   "
