The rule, issued last December, applies to employees of companies that operate dining rooms at a loss in order to offer free or cheap meals to their staff. The I.R.S. says that employees can be taxed on the difference between what, if anything, they pay for the meals and what they would have to pay in order for the dining room to break even. The only exceptions apply to dining rooms that are open to all employees, not just executives."

The Roosevelts lived in the neighborhood, and much of society's cream flocked to the Academy of Music, which stood nearby as the center of the city's theatrical district.   The square was also the midpoint of the Ladies' Mile, a stretch of fashionable stores and memorable buildings. In later years, it became a focal point of civil unrest when anarchists, Socialists and Communists used it for mass demonstrations. Still later, in the late 1970's, the square became an open-air drug market."

Alibrandi, the chairman and chief executive of the Whittaker Corporation. ''And if it can go wrong, it will. And at the worst possible time.''   These are lessons Mr. Alibrandi understands well. For about 18 months, he has been trying to put Whittaker on a new course after the loss of its lucrative hospital management contract with Saudi Arabia. Its major thrust now is the creation of a $1 billion chain of health maintenance organizations by 1990. All it has to show so far, however, is a handful of such operations, a set of blueprints for more, the prospect of up to five years of losses, and a lot of skeptics.   Its goal is highly ambitious, at best, competitors and Wall Street analysts say. Whittaker has plenty of company as it jumps into the race to build the first nationwide chain of H.M.O.'s, and, as a newcomer, it will be struggling for market share against such giants as the Cigna Corporation, U.S. Health Care Systems and Maxicare Health Plans Inc."

City Called Key to Control    Diplomats had said earlier that the rebel movement, known as the National Resistance Army, needed to take control of Jinja, 50 miles east of Kampala, to restore essential services that were disrupted during the fighting in Kampala and by fleeing Government troops.  [ Some troops fled to the Murchison Falls game park, where they were reported to be slaughtering rare wild animals for food just as Idi Amin's men did seven years ago, according to reports reaching the capital quoted by Reuters.

In a recent autobiography, Mr. Waldheim discussed only his early military service with the German forces on the Soviet front in 1941, passing over his subsequent World War II activities in the Balkans with a German Army group that conducted brutal campaigns against Yugoslav partisans and their civilian supporters.   Since information about the Balkan phase of his military service first became public earlier this month, Mr. Waldheim has said that his duties were those of a German-Italian interpreter on the staff of the commander of Army Group E, Gen. Alexander Lohr. The general was tried in Belgrade as a war criminal in 1947 and was executed."

''People who pay estimated taxes are people who have fairly substantial amounts of income not covered by withholding,'' Roderic P. Young of the Internal Revenue Service said."

That was cause enough for the laser-lit festivities, accompanied by the 113-piece Houston Symphony Orchestra in its ultramodern music hall here, that Compaq threw Thursday for its employees, dealers and dozens of Wall Street analysts.   What many of the analysts said they found more telling for Compaq, as it continues to jockey with the giant International Business Machines Corporation for buyers of personal computers, is the firm grip on costs the company has maintained during its explosive growth. Inventories Pared    In a year in which Compaq's sales jumped 53 percent, to $503 million, the company actually pared inventories of circuit boards, microprocessor chips and other parts by $9 million, to $76 million, from the 1984 year-end total. This translates into greater earnings because it frees money that otherwise would be tied up in parts sitting in warehouses."

The numbing cold swept on the prairie wind through canyons of high-rise offices and stores has become less formidable now that Winnipegers can cross Portage and Main through an underground shopping mall sprawling beneath Canada's most notorious street corner.   But the hyperbole is not undeserved, for Winnipeg sometimes has been ranked behind Fairbanks, Alaska, as the coldest city in North America, with only 116 frost-free days each year.   ''There is no city in the world larger and colder than Winnipeg,'' said James G. Carr, director of community relations at the University of Winnipeg, with the perverse pride that Winnipegers exhibit toward their climate.

Most I.R.A. money has gone into certificates of deposit, but the present one-year C.D. yield of about 8 percent has sent many investors in search of higher-yield options. For a growing number, the search is ending with publicly registered limited partnerships, which are riskier than C.D.'s but could produce double-digit compound yields.   ''Many investors equate limited partnerships with tax shelters,'' said Charles Lefkowitz, president of Financial Blueprints Inc., a financial planning firm based in Florham Park, N.J. ''But some limited partnerships are suitable for I.R.A. investors, because they're structured to generate current income.'' William Turchyn Jr., senior vice president and national director of direct investments for E.F. Hutton & Company, said, ''About 25 percent of the money we raise for limited partnerships now winds up in I.R.A.'s.'' In fact, partnerships with a minimum investment of $2,000 or less probably are aimed at I.R.A. investors."

Public goods are goods and services that the entire community benefits from but which no single consumer or consuming country will necessarily pay for. By international economic public goods, Mr. Kindleberger meant open markets in times of glut, supplies in times of acute shortage, steady flows of capital to developing countries, international money, coordination of economic policy and last-resort lending in times of financial crisis.   The implication is that without a nation strong enough and responsible enough to play the role of leader, the international system is in peril, despite the exhilaration of the moment."

Prices for stocks and bonds were down from Friday. And with no sign that the five leading industrialized nations that make up the group were planning to push the dollar down much further, currencies and financial futures traded in narrow ranges, except for the British pound, which dropped sharply against other currencies as the price for North Sea oil fell to less than $20 a barrel.   Market participants described the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain as a ''non-event'' endorsing a status quo position on exchange rates and interest rates. Although it had been, in the words of one futures dealer, ''transparently improbable'' that the meeting would lead to a coordinated attack on interest rates, securities prices rose at the end of last week in the hope that Japanese and French calls for such a step would be heeded."

''We shall keep the door to peace open and enable Palestinians to assume responsibilities as they wish to,'' he said in an interview at his home.   The Israeli leader's comments came a week after King Hussein of Jordan ended efforts to work out a joint strategy with the Palestine Liberation Organization for Middle East peace talks.   In the interview, Mr. Peres outlined steps that Israel would take, or was considering, to enhance the ability of the 1.3 million Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to more easily express their political views and to play a more active role in administering their affairs. The Peres Government has previously advanced such an approach, with relatively few specifics, under the name of ''devolution.''"

Financing for some major capital projects for sewers, roads and school buildings has been postponed since the start of the year. And local government officials report that restrictions on cooperative ventures with private businesses are complicating efforts to attract new businesses and stimulate local economies.   Although the House bill to overhaul the nation's tax system is not law, it has already forced changes because provisions covering sales of bonds whose interest is not subject to Federal income tax would be applied retroactively to Jan. 1, 1986.   Lobbying has already begun in the Senate Finance Committee to change that date and other aspects of the House bill. But if the Senate accepts the House version, local governments that disregard the House's restrictions -and the investors who buy their tax-exempt bonds - could find that interest on the bonds is taxable beginning from the date of issuance."

In the old days, couples who wished to part had to prove that one of them had ''sinned,'' and usually the sinner paid.   But no-fault divorce, which was designed to eliminate much of the acrimony and sham testimony that once took place in court, changed the rules. The divorce process no longer focuses on ''who did what'' so much as ''who gets what.'' Virtually every state, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, has adopted some form of equitable distribution law. These statutes are based on the premise that marriage is an economic partnership, and that property acquired during a marriage should be divided in a way that recognizes the contributions of both parties - homemaking services, for example, as well as monetary support."

Oil has become a commodity like any other, and the price changes of recent weeks are part of a pattern of volatility that will characterize the market in the future.   With the advantage of hindsight, we can see rather clearly how the seeds of OPEC's destruction were planted years ago. OPEC managers (and most of the rest of us) seriously underestimated the speed with which the industrial economies could adapt through investment in more energy-efficient dwellings, cars and industrial machinery. And few predicted the increased flow of non-OPEC oil from a price-induced drilling boom. As a result, the cartel overshot badly in setting crude prices, particularly in the months following the Iranian revolution, in late 1978 and 1979.   It was downhill from there, with a reduction in the total market and a drastic cut in OPEC's share. OPEC's production is now around 18 million barrels a day, and it needs to be cut another 2 million or so to match weakening demand. A decade ago, capacity totaled more than 30 million barrels a day. Today, even with the ravages of the Iran-Iraq war and the rundown of capacity in places like Kuwait, OPEC countries still could produce 40 percent to 50 percent more than they do now."

The contemplated action, using conventional weapons, would be intended to tip the nuclear balance in favor of the United States and induce the Soviet Union to end the conflict on terms favorable to American forces, according to the Navy.   In the past, some senior Navy officials have declined to commit themselves publicly to such a strategy. In an interview in November, the Secretary of the Navy, John F. Lehman Jr., said it was ''not necessarily'' United States strategy to attack Soviet strategic submarines in a nonnuclear war.& Policy Has Critics Some critics have said that Navy attacks using conventional weapons against Soviet submarines carrying long-range nuclear missiles would put pressure on the Soviet Union to use nuclear weapons in response and would increase the risk that a conventional conflict would turn into a nuclear war."

In at least three lawsuits, Arthur Andersen & Company, the nation's largest accounting firm, is charged by investors and creditors with having given Mr. DeLorean's company unqualified audit approval despite clues that something was amiss. The plaintiffs claim that Andersen knew, or should have known, about what they contend was fraud at DeLorean Motors. And, they say, the Chicago-based firm should have disclosed the information to them.   The plaintiffs allege that some of their money was diverted through a Swiss bank account maintained in the name of GPD Services Inc., a Panamanian company with a Geneva address, to Mr. DeLorean's personal account in the United States. Andersen, they say, had ample reason to suspect financial irregularities in Delorean Motor's transactions with GPD, and should have further pursued the circumstances of GPD's contract with the car company - even, perhaps, auditing the books of GPD, which was not Andersen's client. Andersen counters that the investors gripes come from their losses in a risky area and that it was under no obligation to delve into GPD's records."

''The President is here,'' Mr. Duvalier said in the colorful Creole language of Haiti, ''strong, firm as a monkey's tail.'' The phrase is a common Creole expression.   The erroneous information that the President, 34 years old, had fled came after a week of tumultuous anti-Government demonstrations in half a dozen cities and towns in this country, the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. On Thursday, State Department officials said they had decided to take steps to block about $7 million in direct aid to Haiti because of human rights abuses."

But that rally has not reduced the anxiety of traders and investors, who must decide whether the rally will continue.   Now that bond yields have plunged decisively into single-digit territory, analysts are brushing the dust off financial records of the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's to remind themselves of ''normal'' market conditions. What they find is that long-term bond yields are at their lowest levels since April 1978, but remain high compared with earlier years."

The powerful combination of falling interest rates and declining oil prices gave a big lift to equities in most major stock markets in the last three months.   To be sure, market performance was uneven because of varying domestic economic circumstances. The weaker dollar, in particular, was a mixed blessing, lowering inflation for some countries, but hurting their exporters. Thus, the Western European bourses, which led last year's charge, are starting to wane to some degree, while the United States market is moving ahead at a faster rate.   But over all the first quarter of this year topped the strong performance of the last quarter of 1985. The Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index rose 17.5 percent during the three months, compared with a 13 percent increase in the preceding three-month period."

''Readings on economic growth in the weeks ahead will continue lackluster,'' said Donald H. Straszheim, cheif economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, adding that short-term rates may decline as the Federal Reserve ''leans toward easing.'' This week, many analysts expect Government reports to show a decline in February's housing starts from the high January level and a small increase in personal income.   In the latest issue of Weekly Economic and Financial Commentary, the Merrill Lynch official said that ''plunging oil prices will eventually help the U.S. economy a great deal but the decline's bad effects are showing up first.'' Once oil companies digest the bad effects and consumers begin to benefit from lower energy prices and increased financial wealth, the economy will rebound, inflationary pressures will rise and bond yields will increase modestly, said Mr. Straszheim."

The economy, they feared, would slip into recession again in 1986, finally tiring after more than three years of solid growth.   But the feisty stock market and plunging interest rates have changed all that. Economists all over are expecting another respectable - albeit not sizzling -performance this year. (See graphics display on Page 4.) Exploding stock values have added more than $1 trillion to the nation's wealth over the last 18 months, experts say, giving consumers added confidence and new buying power. But business leaders fear that increased competition at home and abroad could make this a tough year. To flesh out the details, industry by industry, The New York Times asked its own specialists to look ahead for 1986. Here are their reports."

In a report made public today, the organization, Americas Watch, also accused the armed forces of trying to ''derail'' President Belisario Betancur's efforts to negotiate a peace agreement with an array of rebel groups after almost four decades of political violence in Colombia.   Americas Watch said some kidnappings and killings of civilian noncombatants had been carried out by leftist guerrillas, but it blamed the armed forces for ''the great majority of violent abuses of human rights.''   ''Despite Betancur's good intentions, the army and police continue to violate human rights with impunity,'' the report said. It also said that, with large areas of Colombia under military control, paramilitary death squads operated freely and were responsible for 1,455 assassinations between early 1982 and August 1985. Some 540 people are listed as ''disappeared.''"

But Mr. Marini's vigor in pursuing the case led defense lawyers to concede Thursday that it was premature to predict what he would seek when he finishes his plea next week.

If the polls are to be believed, however, the recent sharp improvement in France's economy has come too late to save the Socialists from defeat. On the other hand, the progress would encourage a new right-wing government to press ahead with its electoral commitment to roll back France's centuries-old tradition of state control over the economy.   Until now, many economists feared that the opposition party's pledge to ease price and exchange controls, reduce restrictions on worker dismissals, cut taxes and denationalize state-owned companies would result in a wider trade deficit, more inflation and higher unemployment.   But the sharp drop in oil prices lessens many of these risks by slowing inflation, improving France's trade accounts and giving a welcome fillip to economic growth."

The crisis was brought to a head by the resignation last Thursday of Gerard Gourgue, the only one of five original full members of the ruling junta who was widely recognized as a longtime opponent of the Duvalier dictatorship.   The shake-up took place in the context of almost continuous work stoppages, strikes and protests. Over the last few weeks, ordinary Haitians, for the first time in years, have gained an awareness of their power to affect events. They have pressed demands both for higher wages and for a thorough purge of officials associated with the dictatorship who continued to occupy many positions of influence."

The coming talks, which will also deal with intercontinental weapons and space weapons, are the first since the Geneva summit meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev in November.

Along with intelligence reports, orders to his generals and telegrams urging him to take strong action, Mr. Marcos's desk was stuffed with requests for favors, promotions and loans, a prayer and a prediction by a member of a religious cult that Mr. Marcos would be the vehicle for the second coming of Christ.   The documents offer a glimpse of events from within Malacanang Palace as the world outside crumbled around it during the crucial days in mid-February leading to a military revolt that drove Mr. Marcos from office.   The contents of his desk include strategy suggestions for influencing President Reagan, a draft proclamation of a state of emergency that was not put into effect, and election tally sheets with notations that appear to indicate Mr. Marcos's involvement in vote manipulation."

Though it would never admit it, that is essentially what the fast-food industry is doing with its slick merchandising of products dunked in fat and laced with salt. While it may be unrealistic to expect fast-food restaurants to adopt a completely healthful menu, is it too much to ask that they label product ingredients so that consumers can at least make informed choices about what they eat?   Actually, current Federal regulations call for ingredient labeling of packaged foods, but there is some question whether this applies to fast-food restaurants. Last month, the Agriculture Department rejected a petition filed by several consumer health groups to extend labeling requirements to meat and poultry products served in fast-food restaurants, contending that the practice would be expensive, cumbersome and unnecessary. A similar petition is now pending before the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for most fast-food products besides meat and poultry."

The company, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, regularly used to run up losses proportionate to its size as the world's third-largest, non-American multinational company.   But now, E.N.I. seems to be curing itself. In one of the sharpest turnarounds in business history, E.N.I. reported a profit of about $474 million for 1985, based on year-end exchange rates, compared with losses of about $871 million in 1983 and about $34 million in 1984. The transformation of E.N.I.'s balance sheet is the result of a program, begun in 1983, under which Italy's Socialist Government decided to run E.N.I. like a private company, but without relinquishing its ownership.   Like all of Italy's state holding companies, E.N.I. is a political creature. While its good health is crucial to the Italian economy because it provides more than half of the nation's oil and gas supplies, the company's recent success also demonstrates the extent to which management techniques copied from the private sector can improve the performance of a state enterprise that must pursue goals set in political forums rather than the marketplace."

But while the decision spread concern among environmentalists and state officials, its import is unclear even for New Jersey, the state most directly affected. This is because the Court did not specify whether the pre-emptive effect of the Federal Superfund law continued after key provisions of that measure expired in September and because of disputes about how much money today's decision requires New Jersey to refund."

Rockefeller, a young partner in a produce business in Cleveland, ventured into the oil business in 1863, the industry was in the midst of a disastrous glut, with wildly fluctuating prices and wholesale bankruptcies. Mr. Rockefeller saw opportunity in the chaos, and by 1882 he had established the Standard Oil Trust, the leviathan that eventually gave birth to the modern Exxon Corporation.   The environment of collapsing oil prices is certainly more complicated now than it was in the industry's infancy. But when oil analysts look at Exxon's future, they invariably look backward as well as forward. What they see is an almost impregnable giant that has been able to take advantage of opportunities offered by bad markets as well as good ones.   So while Exxon is facing many of the same short-term problems as the rest of the industry, analysts say that its enormous cash flow and light debt load could provide a historic opportunity for the world's largest oil company to become that much larger."

At $3.35 an hour, the minimum wage is still at the same level it was in January 1981. In that same time, the cost of living has risen by 26 percent, so that a full-time, year-round minimum wage worker currently earns income equivalent to only 76 percent of the poverty level for a family of three."

Exploding stock values have added more than $1 trillion to the nation's wealth over the last 18 months, experts say, giving consumers added confidence and new buying power.

In one case, a labor union magazine was closed because the Government said it did not have enough censors to read and check its contents.

But it was not until November, when interest rates made houses more affordable, that they found a buyer for the four-bedroom house they had owned for 22 years.   The Casmers then approached J. Roger Glunt, a Pittsburgh-area builder who specializes in single-family homes selling for $100,000 to $150,000 and whose business, he said, is now the best it has been in five years. Besides customers, he says he has banks pouring in the door. ''They're flooding us with rate sheets saying, 'Hey! We've got money!' ''   Next, the Casmers went to one of these lenders, Mellon Bank, which had knocked its rates for 15-year and 30-year conventional mortgages below 10 percent at the start of the year, sooner than most other lenders. ''We are probably doing in the vicinity of $20 million a month in western Pennsylvania,'' said Gary Frauenhotz, executive vice president in charge of mortgage banking. ''That compares with $3 million to $4 million a month a year ago.'' The bank granted the Casmers a 9 1/2 percent, 30-year loan. As Pittsburgh goes, so goes the nation."

A conservative Republican, Mr. Conable gets along well with the Reagan Administration and is likely to be of greater help with the Baker plan to increase the lending role of the multinational development agency.   Producer prices plunged 1.6 percent in February, the biggest drop ever, mainly because lower oil prices are trickling through the economy. Gasoline prices, for example, dropped 11 percent, and home heating oil dropped 26 percent.

''We just couldn't raise that kind of money, at least not from the private banking sector alone,'' said a senior officer of an international bank who attended the meeting, which was held in New York Tuesday. Viewpoint of the Bankers    For bankers, however, withholding large amounts of new loans from Mexico may be more easily said than done. United States bankers who work in Mexico City said in January that their institutions were already so heavily lent out to Mexico that they would have no choice but to extend billions of dollars in fresh credits."

Shcharansky has moved supporters of another dissident, the physicist Andrei D. Sakharov, to speculate on whether he might also be freed.   But in view of his reported role in producing the first Soviet hydrogen bomb, the Nobel Peace Prize winner's prospects for being freed from internal exile in the Russian city of Gorky appear, at best, uncertain.   The Soviet position, restated by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in an interview Feb. 4 with the French Communist newspaper L'Humanite, is that Dr. Sakharov - convicted in 1980 of engaging in illegal activities after years of publicly criticizing Soviet policy - would not be given permission to travel because ''he remains the bearer of particularly important state secrets,'' an apparent allusion to Dr. Sakharov's work on the hydrogen bomb after World War II.   Interviews with several people who played similar roles in the United States nuclear weapons program indicated that Dr. Sakharov could cast light on projects talked of, planned or under way when he was cut off from the Soviet nuclear weapons program."

The core of a message that key Administration officials said would be sent to Congress says, ''The American people believe in human rights and oppose tyranny in whatever form, whether of the left or the right.''   This new approach differs in emphasis from the one enunciated by Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former delegate to the United Nations. That policy held that ''traditional authoritarian'' regimes were ''less repressive,'' more susceptible to change and better for American interests than Marxist rulers. Left Called Greater Threat    Mr. Reagan's statement still calls leftist dictatorships the greater and ''unique'' threat to world peace. But his intention is take advantage of his recent role in helping to remove right-wing dictators in the Philippines and Haiti and to blunt charges that he has a double standard on human rights."

And earlier, it was Ted Turner who converted a foundering Atlanta TV station into the nation's first ''superstation'' by beaming its programs via satellite to cable networks around the country.   Now the 47-year-old Georgian has plunged into the most daring venture of all: the purchase of the MGM/ UA Entertainment Company for $1.5 billion. It is Mr. Turner's first foray into Hollywood, his first purchase of a piece of the show business establishment. And though Mr. Turner defends the acquisition staunchly - and he may yet prove to be right - many on Wall Street are deeply skeptical about the price he paid and the prospect for profits."

At the same time Mr. Reagan sent a message to Ferdinand E. Marcos in Hawaii, praising his ''difficult and courageous decision'' to step down after 20 years as Philippine President, according to the officials.   Meanwhile, representatives of the new Philippine Government and some members of Congress said they would take steps to try to strip Mr. Marcos of millions of dollars of assets in this country that might have been gained illegally.  [ Page A15. ]  The White House said Mr. Marcos might remain in Hawaii for a long stay. The 68-year-old former President and about two dozen associates, including his personal physician, landed at Hickam Air Force Base today aboard a United States military plane from Guam."

Analysts said the surge in bond prices in late afternoon was fueled by a prediction by the First Boston Corporation's economist, Albert M.

The long Treasury bond - the 9 1/4 percent 30-year issue due in 2016 -fell to 7.77 percent. 'Inflation Is Dead'    ''For the bond market's money, inflation is dead and decomposing,'' said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

Similarly, the sharp drop in bond yields and the rise in bond prices have delighted many local governments and corporations that are now able to refinance outstanding bonds sold when interest rates were much higher. This allows the issuers to reduce interest expenses.   But most individuals who buy bonds tend to be long-term investors, and for them the redemption of high-coupon issues presents the problem of re-investing their money in new, lower-yielding bonds. Their situation is similar to that faced by holders of money market funds and certificates of deposit who no longer can enjoy the lofty returns once offered by these instruments."

Mr. Martin and the other three Reagan appointees overruled Mr. Volcker's objections to the recent discount rate cut, and the Fed chairman was sharply criticized by one of the new members, Martha R. Seger, who said he was moving too slowly on lowering interest rates. Mr. Volcker is used to being at odds with the Administration, but dissension from the Fed board is another matter and was seen by some as a signal that he should resign.

There are probably more similarities than differences among the different categories of tax professionals and no hard-and-fast rules about who is best equipped to do what.

But the specialist right for one person may not have the expertise needed by another, so it is useful to understand the distinctions among the different categories of tax advisers."

As prices for crude oil for immediate delivery have fallen from slightly over $30 a barrel in the third week of November to more than $25 a week ago and $20.59 yesterday, it has helped to reduce yields on Treasury securities. A drop in oil prices increases the chances of lower rates in the future, traders and investors assume, because it points toward lower inflation and could make the Federal Reserve more inclined to follow a generous monetary policy.   Although lower oil prices have been a catalyst for lower interest rates in recent months, many economists have warned that the bond market might overestimate the deflationary effect of lower prices."

During a recent interview in Washington, Mr. Shultz said he considered that the huge American trade deficit with Japan was a result of a combination of factors - the high dollar, the United States rate of expansion relative to the rest of the world, and ''only partly'' to Japanese restrictions on the inflow of goods, but ''more basically to an imbalance between gross savings and gross investment'' in Japan.

Even before the Federal Reserve Board cut the interest rate it charges financial institutions on March 7 by half a percentage point, to 7 percent, and banks cut their prime rate half a point, to 9 percent, yields in the bond market had been moving down in anticipation of the Fed's action. On Thursday, the yield for the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue fell to 7.59 percent, the lowest level in about nine years.   One result, according to IDD Information Services Inc., a financial services concern, is that by the close of the quarter today, companies will have raised about $63 billion -three times the amount raised in the domestic capital markets during the same period last year. And, of course, more money was raised overseas."

As a commendable first step, the Reagan Administration has proposed the sale of a portion of the $245 billion portfolio of outstanding Government loans, such as those to students and small-business men.   The political attractiveness of privatization is not hard to fathom. Traditional deficit cutting forces lawmakers to antagonize powerful blocks of voters or to raise taxes - both unpleasant political choices. Privatization, on the other hand, provides a way to reduce the deficit by giving voters a private source of supply for some of the goods and services now provided by the Government."

Marcos of the Philippines has drawn virtually unanimous approval and very little criticism in Washington. As the decision was formulated, it was apparently not the subject of any serious disagreement within the Administration, and it has received bipartisan support in Congress, where Democrats as well as Republicans have been praising the Administration's handling of the crisis.   The opposition has been generated mostly in the expatriate Filipino community, where some people have argued that Mr. Marcos should not be rewarded with sanctuary for abusing his position in Manila.   Mr. Marcos, his family and an entourage of associates were flown from the Presidential palace by helicopter to Clark Air Base, and from there to Guam and Hawaii, after crowds of Filipinos and military units rallied to demand his removal. The surge of protests followed an election Feb. 7 marked by fraud and violence, in which many Filipinos believed Corazon C. Aquino had been cheated out of victory by Marcos forces."

In the clashes around the Gulf of Sidra, the analysts said, the Navy used ''standoff'' tactics, with pilots staying away from their targets and firing guided missiles at military installations. They also depended more on electronics to pinpoint these targets than the Navy had in the past.   The tactics had been developed in the wake of criticism of the performance of Navy fighter planes in Lebanon in 1983 from people within and outside Navy aviation, including Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, himself a reserve aviator.   In Lebanon, Navy aircraft flew to their targets and dove to drop bombs on enemy forces near civilian areas.

''Turin is not a magic city,'' insisted the Rev. Franco Peradotta, the vicar general of the diocese and a 58-year-old priest with an easy smile and a practical turn of mind. ''I have never seen a possession by the Devil.''"

Congress enacted RICO in 1970 to fight organized crime and to protect legitimate businesses from invasions by organized crime. Today, however, legitimate businesses are more intimidated by RICO than by gangsters - they face claims totaling hundreds of millions of dollars stemming from RICO charges. The charge of ''racketeering'' (which encompasses a wide variety of criminal activities, including securities fraud) is now attached routinely to civil suits by unscrupulous plaintiffs solely to intimidate innocent companies.   Many of the problems stem from an aspect of the law that was virtually unnoticed in 1970: the private right of action, which allows individuals to bring suit under RICO for a variety of offenses, such as the provision of illegal goods and services or fraud."

Continuing his weeklong campaign for his $100 million aid package in a meeting with House Republican leaders, Mr. Reagan said a great many people were deceived about Communist subversion and hinted that such was true of some in Congress.   The assertion came as some members of Congress complained that the Administration was losing votes for the aid because of the shrillness of its campaign and the suggestion by some that Congressional opponents were unpatriotic.   Mr. Reagan, asked at the start of the meeting if Democrats were facing a choice between supporting him or the Communists, replied:   ''It's what the choice comes down to, whether it is knowingly or not.

But at least one other major military contractor, the General Electric Company, has faced such charges, and was temporarily barred from Pentagon work in early 1985. G.E. pleaded guilty to 108 counts of falsifying time cards, and was fined $1.04 million, the maximum allowable. G.E. was also ordered to pay back the $800,000 that was falsely billed.   In scores of interviews outside factory gates, inside their homes and over the telephone since last Friday, many General Dynamics workers said that supervisors at the General Dynamics plants here sometimes incorrectly billed employee hours to the Federal Government.

In mid-February, for example, MCA Inc., the parent company of Universal Pictures, bought television station WOR in New Jersey for $387 million. The 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation last year purchased six television stations in major cities. And both Columbia Pictures Industries and MCA recently bought theaters.   Owning the final outlets for programs is not a new business for the movie makers. Their grip was so strong in the late 1940's that the Government separated the functions in a series of antitrust orders. Many of the big movie makers were forced to split their theater and production activies, and are still subject to those orders unless they win special permission from the courts."

''The real issue is the impact of the price cuts on the growth rates in the industrial world and on interest rates,'' said Christine Bindert, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. who has worked as an economic adviser for several Latin American governments.   To be sure, developing nations -just like the United States and other industrialized countries - cannot know just how much they will benefit from falling oil prices until they see how far the price decline goes and how long it lasts.   Nonetheless, economists estimate that the decline in prices should add between one-half of 1 percent and 1 percent to the growth rate of the economies of industrialized nations this year. That should in turn increase demand for Latin American, African and Asian manufactured goods and commodities."

A Nicaraguan official in Washington said he had no information from his Government about the presence of Mr. Rivera's group but added that if it had entered the country illegally and was traveling with armed men, it would ''have to suffer the consequences.''   Although the Miskito spokesman said the delegation had not gone into Nicaragua to engage in combat, the Nicaraguan official, Manuel Cordero, deputy chief of the Nicaraguan Embassy, pointed out that one of the American Indians on the trip, Russell Means, had declared in Costa Rica on Nov. 10 that he hoped to recruit 90 to 100 ''warriors from North America'' to fight the Sandinistas."

Since then several others have emerged, all as a result of advances in biological research that have made it possible to find, reproduce and study human genes, the blueprints for all living things, as well as modify them to produce substances different from any that have developed naturally.   Genetic engineering, as this process is known, is based mainly on advances that have taken place over the last 10 years. Already more than 200 biotechnology companies in the nation are seeking to exploit the new capabilities. And a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences estimated that this new industry had already created 5,000 to 10,000 new jobs. Additional employment is likely to develop in fermentation technology, the segment of the industry devoted to actual production of large quantities of novel or previously rare substances."

But Arab officials have expressed dismay that the well-equipped Iraqi military has been so far ineffective in expelling the Iranian invaders, and they say they fear the continued presence of Iranians on Arab soil could instigate incidents of sabotage by Islamic fundamentalists in their countries.

The decline, which began in February 1985, has already cut the dollar 40 to 50 percent against the pound, the German mark, the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. Yet, Reagan Administration officials argue that even more time is needed for the market effects to take hold - especially since the bulk of the drop occurred only since last September's meeting of finance ministers in New York that set a coordinated intervention policy.   ''I think that the month-to-month trade deficit will be headed down by the end of 1986, partially as a result of the dollar's decline, and we definitely should see improvement in 1987,'' Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige told a Congressional hearing yesterday."

In the four months since she decided to run for office, Mrs. Aquino, a genuinely reluctant candidate, has moved from being a symbol around which the nation could unite to being a leader.

Several traders said that, if Mr. Heyman was planning to do something, he would have to do it by tomorrow morning, when advance trading will begin in bonds that Carbide is expected to issue in a few weeks.   The bonds are tailored to limit sales of company operations if anyone takes over the company. GAF has devised a plan to defuse the bond provisions, but its plan would be much harder to carry out once professionals began trading in the bonds because they would become widely disseminated.

It was not clear whether approval for the flights has come only from the Salvadoran Air Force or also from the Government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte.   Officially, both Government and military officials continue to deny assisting the Nicaraguan anti-Government guerrillas, who are known locally as contras."

''Most senators never expected this to pass the House,'' said Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey. But pass the House it did, in the last week of the Congressional session, the result of an extraordinary alliance between President Reagan and the House Democratic leadership.   Now this highly controversial measure, one that would affect almost every taxpayer in America, individuals and companies alike, is in the lap of the Senate, and the senators have begun to squirm. Hardly any of them believes that the proposals advanced by President Reagan last spring and the bill approved by the House have much merit. But the prevailing view is that the politics of the day virtually assure that the Senate will approve a measure along those lines and that the bill will become law before the end of the year."

An announcement over the weekend that Robert Hersant had purchased the principal Lyons newspaper, Le Progres, has caused a sensation in French political circles, where it was seen as a calculated attempt to embarrass President Francois Mitterrand's Socialists during the campaign for the March 17 elections.   In what was seen as a deliberate display of contempt for the Socialists' efforts to limit his holdings, Mr. Hersant did not consult the Commission for the Openness and Pluralism of the Press, a body set up by the Government to review compliance with the 1984 law restricting press ownership.   Last year, when Mr. Hersant bought a Reims paper called L'Union, he sought to get around the new law by making the purchase through his son Philippe.

It comes with a high-tech 151-horsepower V-6 engine, a racing style suspension, plush interior and a sticker price close to $20,000. It is not even called a Honda.   The company's new Acura line -which centers on the top-of-the-line V-6 Legend but will also include the smaller four-cylinder Integra - is the strongest indication yet that the Japanese auto makers are determined to push into the highly profitable and growing American market for luxury performance cars. With the Acura, a new 200-horsepower Toyota Supra, Mazda's RX-7 Turbo and Nissan's 300 ZX, the Japanese are going after the market now dominated by such European manufacturers as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Porsche and Saab. The few American entries in this category include the Chevrolet Corvette and Lincoln Mark 7 LSC, although others are under development.   ''The Legend is a legitimate competitor for BMW,'' said Ann C. Knight, an auto industry analyst with Paine Webber Inc. ''The question is whether they can break through the cult-like loyalty to the German products. They probably can't do it on price. The more Mercedes-Benz charges, the more people seem to like it.''"

For fixed-rate mortgages with a 25 percent down payment, the average effective rate declined to 11.34 from 11.45 percent, a slower rate of decline than a month earlier.   Economists say the drop in mortgage rates is a result of rallies in bond markets, decreasing oil prices and a less inflationary environment. In some parts of the country, fixed-rate mortgages are now available at less than 10 percent. As recently as a year ago, interest levels on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were as high as 13 percent."

A group of Carmelite nuns has been living in an unused theater just outside the Auschwitz site in southern Poland since late 1984. But the presence of the convent, which was set up as a place of prayer for all who died in the camp, was apparently not widely known until a fund-raising appeal was begun last year in Europe by a Catholic group in an effort to renovate the building in which 10 nuns now live.   The group, Aid to the Church in Distress, has also been criticized by some Jewish and Catholic leaders for a statement issued in conjunction with the fund-raising drive, in which it raised $150,000 in Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands during Pope John Paul II's visit to these countries last May."

Under the labor act, employers are prohibited from dismissing or otherwise penalizing workers for engaging ''in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.'' The case before the N.L.R.B. focuses on whether employees who file a complaint with a government safety agency without consulting their co-workers have engaged in ''concerted'' activity and are thus protected by the labor act.

Over nine days, with a day off on Sunday, the 5,000 delegates to the 27th party congress sat stoically in their assigned rows in the cavernous Palace of Congresses through some 100 speeches, as well as 31 by foreign Communist leaders.   Each speech was printed in pages of solid type in the party newspaper Pravda and the Government newspaper Izvestia, with ''applause,'' ''prolonged applause'' and sometimes ''tumultuous, prolonged applause'' marked in at appropriate spots.   The only other interruptions at the congress, which ended Thursday, have been for ''votes,'' all unanimous, to adopt the party program, the economic guidelines, resolutions and other reports."

Fidel V. Ramos has taken a step toward the military changes long sought by Reagan Administration critics of the former Marcos Government.   The general, who was field commander of the small force that sparked the nation to oust Ferdinand E. Marcos, sent a message to the troops announcing that he was demoting some of the strongest Marcos supporters among command officers.   Among the first to ascend in the post-Marcos command are some of the field officers who defected with their troops to his side early, when the risk of a pro-Marcos attack seemed greatest.   Signaling the change was the choice of Brig. Gen. Ramon J. Farolan as chief of the air force. This reflected the fact that among the first to change sides were air force pilots who landed by helicopter gunships at the camp of General Ramos and Juan Ponce Enrile, the Marcos official who began the resistance Saturday and has become the new Government's Minister of Defense, his former post."

Tumbling oil prices, joining falling interest rates, have the stock market soaring anew. Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average crashed through the 1,600 barrier. But investors face some short-term perils, says David B. Bostian Jr., who heads a New York economic consulting firm bearing his name. ''Investor enthusiasm may have caused an overbought situation in the markets,'' said Mr. Bostian, ''and there could be several sharp corrections before the markets resume their advance.''   Alan C. Leventen, president of Twenty-First Futures, a New York financial brokerage, agrees there are pitfalls, but he predicts investors will not stumble upon them until late this year or early in 1987. What is the trap? With inflation relatively low now, investor psychology may be ''overly positive,'' says Mr. Leventen. He expects the declining interest rates to stimulate both business and consumer borrowing and to set the stage for higher interest rates and inflation, which will arouse investor concern."

Marcos, but the White House said it was ''far premature'' to cut off aid and close the two United States military bases there.   The growing emotion on Capitol Hill was demonstrated tonight when the Senate agreed to vote Wednesday on a resolution condemning the ''widespread fraud'' in the Philippine voting and requesting President Reagan to convey the Senate's findings to Mr. Marcos. Aid Suspension Is Urged   Another key Congressional figure added his voice to the criticism of the Manila Government when Representative Dante B. Fascell, Democrat of Florida, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote to President Reagan, urging him to suspend all aid to the Philippines. Mr. Fascell maintained that the United States would suffer ''inevitable damage'' if it failed to distance itself from Mr. Marcos.   Mr. Fascell was part of a chorus of voices on Capitol Hill today urging a cutoff of aid to the Marcos Government, a chorus that included Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, who insisted that the United States end its support for the ''corrupt, authoritarian regime'' of Mr. Marcos."

Though prices in most categories of commercial and residential real estate have not fallen sharply, they have eroded from peaks reached in 1984. Many experts say bargains are beginning to emerge, especially in the office market in the financial district.   Among the signs that the Manhattan market has already softened are these:    * Office vacancy rates have moved up sharply since 1983, particularly in the financial district, where a boom in construction and slower growth in demand have left nearly 9 percent of the space empty, according to the Gordon Office Market Report, a publication put out by one of Manhattan's largest real estate brokers. Estimates from other brokers run as high as 13 percent. The same problem is now spreading to the midtown market,"

The result: a complex patchwork of local, often differing, regulations.   But members of Congress and their aides say that sentiment for Federal action, and perhaps reconsideration of the exemption, is growing, as the lawmakers are barraged with complaints about the cost and availability of insurance.   In a series of hearings held here last week, lawmakers recited a litany of troubles from their constituencies - accounts from municipal governments; school boards; gas station owners; day-care centers; operators of roller-skating rinks and ski slopes, and doctors who are either unable to buy insurance or confronted with huge increases in premiums."

The impishness of a free press is to be seen and believed in Manila these days. It is best visualized in the sidewalk hawkers, those ragamuffins and older entrepreneurs who scatter like roaches across the human flow, confronting pedestrians and walking against traffic as they wave and shout about their great handfuls of newspapers, inky with free flowing words, unfettered curiosity and bombast, at two pesos, or 10 cents, an issue."

Although Friday's sharp 1 3/4-point rise in long-term Treasury issues was exaggerated by the expiration of March options to buy bond futures and a flood of buying in the futures market by securities firms, analysts said the upward direction of bond prices was also supported by good investor demand. Including last week's gains of about 2 5/8 points, the new 9 1/4 percent Treasury bond issue due in 2016 has gained more than 6 1/4 points since Feb. 7, and its yield has fallen to 8.70 percent from 9.30 percent.

Mr. Baker believes the lower the dollar, the more help to the trade deficit and thus the budget deficit. Mr. Volcker believes a dollar that is too low will rekindle inflation. Lower interest rates, within the Fed's realm of control, would tend to force the dollar lower, and Mr. Volcker is not partial to that course.

Then came the decline of the empire, the death of the docks and, since 1945, an exodus of 200,000 people.   Now, with a swiftness that has startled many, a new landscape is taking shape to serve an expanding financial empire hard-pressed for space in the mile-square City of London, only two miles away.   Ten million square feet of office, hotel and retail space, including three huge towers, are planned for the Isle of Dogs on a 71-acre site at Canary Wharf at a cost of $2 billion. At least 40,000 people would be employed there."

For the occasional user of data base software, the problem is compounded by spending a month conquering the rudiments of, say, dBase III and then not using it for a while.

Administration officials acknowledged that Washington was caught off guard on Sunday when an Iranian Navy ship forced an American freighter, the President Taylor, to stop in the Gulf of Oman and submit to a search for war materiel for Iraq.   When no such goods were found, the freighter was allowed to proceed to Fujaira, its desination in the United Arab Emirates. Possible Future Course    A possible future course of action, officials said, would be for the United States to declare that the cargoes of American merchant ships were free of war materiel for Iraq and to authorize Navy warships to use force if necessary to keep the Iranians away. This could lead to a confrontation with the Iranians if they pressed their right to board a ship, but Administration officials said they did not believe the Iranians force the issue."

At the time, South Shore looked to many like a bank interested more in charity than in profits. Yet by lending aggressively to the inner city while other banks shunned the idea, South Shore has not only turned the community around, but has made some money, too.   Though small, with $114 million in assets as of Sept. 30, the bank has been hailed by some urban experts as a prime example of a big-city bank that successfully engineered the turnaround of a community's decline. With South Shore's help, builders in the lakefront community about eight miles south of downtown Chicago have returned to their original grace more than 30 percent of South Shore's turn-of-the-century red brick apartment buildings and almost all of the area's homes."

Although they are very pleased to have the United States support, many Israeli officials are increasingly uncomfortable with the idea that they should be the exclusive ''world policemen'' for a rash of terrorism that has affected citizens of many countries, especially the United States. No Longer the Only Target   Senior Israeli officials quickly add that the questions they are raising should not be interpreted as precluding retaliation by Israel alone.   But they say that much of what the world is witnessing is state-sponsored terrorism that can be countered only by state-sponsored economic and diplomatic sanctions, and that Israel is no longer the only target of terrorists - who seem just as ready to kill Americans or West Europeans in the Palestinian cause. Their questions also probably reflect a degree of exhaustion in Israel with bearing the political and military costs of fighting terrorism for so many years. touched on these themes - particularly the failure of other countries to impose sanctions against nations that are known to support terrorist groups - in a strikingly low-key address he delivered today to the Israeli Parliament on the Rome and Vienna attacks."

On the surface, it is the American assertion of its right of passage through international waters in conflict with Libya's territorial claims.   But on a deeper level, it has been a strike against what Washington says is Libya's support of terrorism, and against the image of a United States helpless to deal with a provocative figure such as the Libyan leader, Col.

This is an economic research operation in the shadow of Washington whose thinkers do not study policy options, rarely testify before Congressional committees and seem to mind not at all that their public recognition quotient is virtually zero.   Yet James M. Buchanan, Gordon Tullock and their small band of disciples at the Center for the Study of Public Choice are the fomenters of a quiet revolution in politico-economic thinking. They are not a policy organization, but one that focuses on the political process - ''on structure, on how the rules work and how they can be changed,'' according to Professor Buchanan.   In their writings and seminars, however, they have been the heralds of less: less government, less regulation, less debt through lower deficits. After years of ry scurity, the proponents of public choice have found their place in the sun during the conservative Reagan era. But they believe their growing support goes far beyond partisan politics; they call themselves proponents of powerful ideas whose time has come. They have had some supporters in previous Administrations and insist that their influence would continue even if the next President were a Democrat."

There have been no French troops in Chad since France withdrew its forces from the country 15 months ago."

Sales were virtually flat near $4.7 billion, and the company's basic steel operations showed a loss, so U.S. Steel got a big boost from its Marathon Oil Company subsidiary, analysts said.   They added that the company's results, while better than those at many other steel makers, were still considered modest."

The proposal by the prosecutor, Antonio Marini - that the Bulgarian, Sergei I. Antonov, and two other Bulgarian defendants, who are being tried in absentia, be ''absolved for lack of proof'' - would not amount to full absolution. Their defense attorneys have protested the proposal, demanding a full declaration of innocence.   But the recommendation, made to the jury of two judges and six lay jurors who will get the case after nearly nine months of intense debate, constituted an admission that the evidence against the Bulgarians was ambiguous at best."

First comes the battle of the budget. The Gramm-Rudman law faces a constitutional test before the Supreme Court. But many economists believe that, whatever happens to the law, fiscal policy will soon be tighter. But how much tighter is difficult to say.   The Congressional Budget Office says President Reagan has underestimated military spending and that his budget for the fiscal year 1987 is $15.7 billion over the Gramm-Rudman deficit limit of $144 billion."

The jeers came from students opposed to United States involvement in the Philippines who displayed signs reading ''Respect Philippine Sovereignty'' and ''American Junk - Get Out of Our System.''"

We're going to ask several foreign policy questions and domestic after. I thought maybe, if possible, we'd start with the Philippines and that whole area.   Sir, several Administration officials were quoted as saying that they were disgusted at what they found in Mr. Marcos's luggage when he came to Hawaii. Do you share their surprise about the scale of his overall corruption when he was leader of the Philippines?   A. Well, I'll tell you, I'm not going to comment on that. I think here, now, we're talking about something that is - there are legalities involved. And I think, rather than comment on that, our interest is in continuing our friendship, historic friendship with the Philippines, and I'm going to let the law and justice take its course. And we'll abide by the laws, but also, that will involve not just hearsay and gossip and so forth, but a determination of what's actually happened. I'll wait for that."

Laurel.   Upstairs, in a forlorn office with a barren desk, Foreign Minister Laurel, who is also Vice President and Prime Minister of the new Government, met his first major foreign delegation.   The visitors had come from China to sign a cultural agreement, and Mr. Laurel took the opportunity to outline his priorities for revitalizing the country's foreign policy after years of its subjection to the personalities of the Marcoses. As squabbles within the coalition now in power in Manila concentrate on domestic political issues and the division of appointments, Mr. Laurel is free, commentators say, to create a highly visible role for himself in foreign affairs."

The January performance was the poorest since sales plummeted 3.9 percent in October after auto makers ended a round of financing incentives.   Auto sales showed a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent in January, reflecting a resumption of the financing deals. But sales at department stores dropped a sharp 2 percent, the second monthly decline. Total consumer sales climbed to $117.5 billion, adjusted for seasonal variation."

But the Vatican generally welcomed the outcome of the struggle, in which President Ferdinand E. Marcos was deposed.   ''At the end, the thing was for the best,'' a high Vatican official said. ''Up to this moment, I think everyone in the world has a feeling of relief.''   The only official comment today came from the Pope himself, whose statements on the conflict had been remarkably cautious."

Pepsico, the second-largest soft-drink company after the Coca-Cola Company, said that net income in the latest three months declined to $89.3 million, or $1 a share, from $89.6 million, or 95 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Sales increased to $2.42 billion, from $2.20 billion."

OFFICIAL WARNS LIBYANS,"  A senior State Department official explicitly warned for the first time today that the Administration would consider military action against Libya if the nonmilitary sanctions already imposed by Washington fail to achieve results.   The official, John C. Whitehead, Deputy Secretary of State, said President Reagan ''reserved the right'' to use military force against Libya if Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi ''doesn't change the pattern of his actions.''

We had learned the painful lessons of the 1930's, that there could be no safety in isolation from the rest of the world. Our nation has responsibilities and security interests beyond our borders - in the rest of this hemisphere, in Europe, in the Pacific, in the Middle East and in other regions - that require strong, confident and consistent American leadership.

The company's success in building its cigarette brands, particularly Marlboro, is legendary, and in the mid-1970's it also seemed to have found the marketing keys to the beer industry when it turned the Miller Brewing Company around.   So, when Philip Morris bought the faltering Seven-Up Company in 1978, the consumer giant's marketing prowess was expected to dazzle again, bringing new life to the St. Louis-based soft drink company that was founded in 1929 as the maker of a headache remedy.   But with 7-Up the Philip Morris marketing touch has apparently failed, and the subsidiary is now rumored to be for sale. The lemon-lime segment of the soft-drink business, a segment that 7-Up has always dominated, never appealed to American tastes the way colas do, leaving Philip Morris with what is essentially a niche product. And competition from Coca-Cola's Sprite and most recently from Pepsi-Cola's Slice, a lemon-lime soft drink with fruit juice, has eaten into 7-Up's leadership within that segment."

Those problems include the more than $900 billion in debts owed by developing countries, two-thirds of it to commercial banks; the danger that a slump in world trade would pose to all countries, industrial and developing alike; the record United States trade deficit, which hit $150 billion last year, and the growing American dependency on capital inflow; the threat of a renewed drive in Congress for protectionism, and the disordered and erratic relations between the dollar and other currencies.

The sources said that the Rockefeller Group and advisers to the investors who want to buy the radio and television subsidiary were working last night to resolve the problem."

The talks, which were held on Wednesday and Thursday in Bern, Switzerland, were positive in tone, the officials said.   The meeting represented the first attempt to follow through on a pledge made at the November summit meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, to initiate discussion of ways to prevent the spread of chemical weapons."

Not only are there likely to be major or minor variations among plans from company to company, but there could also be alternatives within each plan that affect treatment and reimbursement.   It is important therefore to read the plan in effect at your company carefully as the first step in taking advantage of the available benefits. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 requires that all workers receive a copy of a summary plan description and of any changes made in the plan over the ensuing years."

Marcos that he had led a guerrilla resistance unit during the Japanese occupation of his country were ''fraudulent'' and ''absurd.''   Throughout his political career, Mr. Marcos, now President of the Philippines, has portrayed himself as a heroic guerrilla leader, and the image has been central to his political appeal.   In almost every speech throughout his current re-election campaign, including at least one this week, Mr. Marcos has referred to his war record and guerrilla experiences in part to show that he is better able than his opponent, Corazon C. Aquino, to handle the present Communist insurgency. Questions Go Unanswered    But documents that had rested out of public view in United States Government archives for 35 years show that repeated Army investigations found no foundation for Mr. Marcos's claims that he led a guerrilla force called Ang Mga Maharlika in military operations against Japanese forces from 1942 to 1944.   Mr. Marcos declined today to respond to six written questions about the United States Government records, which came to light only recently. The questions were submitted to Mr. Marcos's office this morning in Manila."

And, Thomas Buthelezi said, since the anonymous men grabbed him after a party and lacerated his back with whips, he, too, has feared for his life and wishes now to go and live elsewhere.   From afar, such stories of capricious violence might seem inappropriate in this segregated township, designed by the white authorities to be a model residential area for blacks, some of whom, like Mr. Buthelezi, used to live in tawdry shacks in the yards of others.   Here, on open land, 50 miles northeast of Pretoria, there are tidy homes with water in the faucets and power to run a hi-fi, and small, fenced yards, some ablaze with marigolds.   Yet, since this township was founded and people from South Africa's industrial heartland began to settle here in late 1983, the supposed idyll has been broken in a manner suggesting that despite promises of racial change, this country's white rulers still wish to exercise the kind of social engineering that has marked decades of apartheid."

That's what happened to the Harris Corporation of Melbourne, Fla., and its management was saddened, saddened enough to bring in a new vice president from International Business Machines. And he - Raymond J. Oglethorpe - might very well have switched to a new agency except he and his superiors decided to stay with Foote, Cone & Belding of Chicago, feeling they had invested too much in educating the agency on the complexities of their information-technology-communications-oriented company.   In any event it didn't take Mr. Oglethorpe long to diagnose Harris's advertising problems. He first asked for and got the help of some obliging, successful corporate advertisers such as Beatrice, Northwest Mutual Life and Rockwell International, Its plugged-in logo, all-print campaign, with the theme ''For your information our name is Harris,'' had too much copy that was too technical, Mr. Oglethorpe concluded. It was not all that distinctive and concentrated too much on Harris instead of customer benefits."
