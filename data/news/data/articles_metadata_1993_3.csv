But most were told that the 19-day limit would be waived, giving them the opportunity to apply under the old system, which allowed would-be immigrants to remain in the country -- sometimes for years -- while their cases were being decided.

The proposed changes, which were approved on Sunday by the governing party's majority in the lower house, or Chamber of Deputies, would include some limits on campaign contributions and spending, Government control of election officials and the governing party's traditional dominance of the press."

But what is more important for the investor in two-year notes is this: Someone who bought two-year notes in August 1991 got a yield of 6.46 percent on the money invested. Today, there is no Treasury security -- even the 30-year bond -- that has a yield that high."

Behind these conditions is a Congressional belief that some executives are paid too much and that shareholders need a bigger voice on the subject. Naturally, Congress expects that companies will want to keep their tax deductions, and that to do so they will kowtow to the new rules."

Both Malcolm S. Toon, who heads the American side of the joint committee, and his Russian counterpart, Gen. Dmitri A.

Long an unwieldy conglomerate that left investors confused and its stock underperforming, Dial has spent the better part of a decade shedding businesses, including the Greyhound bus line that it used to be named for, and adding shampoos, detergents and other household and personal care products to its current namesake, Dial soap. But now that the company is finally approaching its goal of turning into a pure consumer play, the consumer product sector is falling out of market favor.   Though operating income from Dial soap, Brillo soap pads, Armour meats and several consumer services operations is growing at a healthy clip, the company's stock has been weak this year. Fearing intense price competition as consumers search for bargains in an economy that remains sluggish, many investors are giving a wide berth to brand-name companies. As a result, Dial stock hasn't been able to repeat last year's performance, when it reached a high of $50.625 with the spinoff of its financial and insurance division. Lately, the stock has been bumping around between $38 and $41."

But much of the rise came before the depth of the recession was obvious. Gross national product is expected to contract by about 2 percent this year. Industrial production is in a lengthy decline. The strength of the German mark against other major currencies has hobbled the nation's vast export sector by pushing the price of German goods sold abroad to uncompetitively high levels."

Everyday objects have meaning as well as utility, a point made wittily by the exhibit that opened last week at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York. ""Mechanical Brides: Women and Machines From Home to Office,"" as the exhibit is called, juxtaposes objects used in what is typically regarded as ""women's work"" -- the washing machine, telephone and typewriter -- with images used over the years to sell the objects. It is a painless, fascinating nutshell history of America's romance with consumption, socio-economic changes associated with that romance in the last century and the different experiences of men and women.    In the late 19th century, technological innovations transformed the middle-class household. Women who had labored at -- or supervised -- the production of food, clothing and furniture or housewares became consumers of mass-produced goods. The male-dominated world of commerce learned to sell its products to women, or rather, to the prevailing cultural stereotypes of women, appealing to emotions as well as utility.

A bootleg copy of the closely guarded proposal began to circulate. It shows a plan that is breathtaking in its sweep, complexity and ambition, but murky in its financing.  [ Page 1. ]  President Clinton's health care plan is imposing not just in its intricacy and detail, but also in its political audacity. News Analysis.  [ 1. ]   The appeal of the proposal is obvious to the 37 million Americans who lack health insurance. But Americans who are insured may have a harder time deciding about their own prospects.  [ 1. ]   The proposals could throw into fast forward trends that are already reshaping the fates of doctors, hospitals and insurers.  [ 10. ] The Economy    The Producer Price Index fell 0.6 percent in August, the Government said, in a report showing surprisingly low inflation. Plunging tobacco prices were largely responsible.  [ 37. ] Companies     Paramount and Viacom may announce a merger as early as this weekend, industry executives said. The deal, estimated at $6.2 billion in stock and $1 billion in cash, would be the biggest media marriage since Time wed Warner four years ago.

[ 39. ]   Hundreds of women flooded lawyers with calls after Dow Corning announced a proposed settlement of implant lawsuits.  [ 7. ] Markets    Eager buyers moved back into stocks, erasing most of the week's previous losses. The Dow industrials rose 32.14, to 3,621.63, and gained 12.30 points for the week.  [ 37. ]   Bond prices surged on news of sharply lower producer prices, nearly erasing Thursday's steep losses.  [ 46. ]   Bearish economic news sent prices falling for crude oil, gold and soybeans. Oil fell to a three-year low.  [ 48. ]   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but fell to a 14-week low against the German mark.  [ 48. ] International     Japan's Foreign Minister suggested that numerical targets for reducing Japan's trade surplus might be acceptable in Tokyo. His remarks mirror a groundswell of opinion in favor of an idea that Japan has resisted for months.  [ 37. ]   Canary Wharf administrators agreed with bank lenders on a $1.7 billion financial rescue package for the London complex of office buildings, which fell victim to the British recession and contributed to the collapse of Olympia & York.  [ 37. ]   Representative Bonior retreated from his plan to use the resources of his office, as House majority whip, against the North American Free Trade Agreement.  [ 7. ] Your Money    The Administration's health care plan would provide health coverage to all, but states could not carry out the changes until 1995 at the earliest. In the interim, people who find themselves without insurance have several options.  [ 35. ]   Some financial advisers offer to buy and manage portfolios of no-load no-commission funds -- for a fee.

Moreover, employees are more and more often willing to trade traditional compensation carrots like wages and benefits for flexibility and autonomy, job characteristics likely to allow them to balance their lives at work and at home.   The startling implication, especially for employers who have been depending on a workforce made tractable by fear: Companies that fail to factor in quality-of-employee-life issues when imposing total quality management or ""re-engineering"" or any other of the competiveness-enhancing, productivity-improving schemes now popular may gain little but a view of the receding backs of their best people leaving for friendlier premises."

The 78-year-old, stony-faced Mr. Kanemaru was thronged by hundreds of journalists as he entered the Tokyo District Court in a wheelchair. He then read slowly from a written statement, asserting his innocence to the charges that he evaded nearly $10 million in taxes. He said he had collected the $50 million to achieve his ""dream,"" a realignment of the corrupt Liberal Democratic Party he all but controlled for the past decade."

So they need income to cover expenses and protection from inflation. Equity could provide that protection, but stocks are more volatile than bonds.

A spokesman for the groups said Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories and in refugee camps in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had been asked to mark ""the black day in which the national rights of the Palestinian people are given up"" with strikes and protest marches."

Instead of pinning our hopes on government help that may never come, or that may dry up as soon as the political winds change, we African-Americans should use our own money as seed money to grow businesses in black urban America. By patronizing black businesses, hiring black employees and otherwise using black dollars for blacks' betterment, African-Americans will aid themselves and also take part in the grand American immigrant tradition of group help."

They liked what they found. And now, even though lumber prices have settled down, many contractors have embraced this ""engineered"" structural wood as a good alternative to the long-span rafters, beams and joists formerly available only from Mother Nature's towering timber.   Engineered lumber, pieced together from veneers of shorter logs or wood strands culled from scrawny young ""weed"" trees like aspen or yellow poplar, can yield beams as long as 80 feet with the help of advanced adhesives and ultrasonic equipment that can measure the strength of small sections of wood. Although more expensive than natural wood, engineered lumber tends to be stronger and lighter. And with fewer tall old trees around these days, more and more contractors may soon have no choice but to adopt manufactured timber."

Barely a third of them now have health benefits, and though many are young and healthy, the work they do puts them at the mercy of the microbial free-for-all that is the immature immune system. Colds and flus are endemic, as are back problems from hefting and carting young children all day. Under the Clinton plan, workers would get benefits from their employers, who would probably qualify for an expense cap of from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll. Self-employed family day-care providers would buy their own insurance but qualify for the 100 percent health insurance tax deduction. Making health care a fact of workers' lives would almost certainly improve quality by reducing turnover.    But child care is a peculiar economic institution. Technically, it is a small business, but one lacking many of the market options of other small businesses.

From their base at the company's research and development campus here, some 30 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, Owens-Corning's asbestos litigation managers have pared the number of outside defense firms they use to just 7, from 60 in 1988. That gives the company increased leverage in price negotiations because each firm now has a bigger share of the business and more incentive to do what Owens wants to keep it."

Washington is taking a gentler attitude toward Germany, urging it to cut its budget deficit and give its powerful central bank more leeway to lower interest rates so other rate cuts will follow throughout Western Europe.

They are equipped with small arms, automatic weapons, crude homemade bombs and walkie-talkies.

They have gravitated around Assiut, Minya, Dairut and the surrounding villages, where some of the worst violence has occurred."

The worst damage, and more than half of the confirmed deaths, occurred on Okushiri, a small island of fishermen and vacationers in the Sea of Japan off the southwestern coast of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost territory. Television images of the island's low-lying village showed scenes of utter devastation, with houses and Buddhist temples splintered in the mud, boats thrown far inland, and roofs of some homes floating out to sea."

Changes in Investments    In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee today, Mr. Greenspan said the central bank was jettisoning the money supply approach because changes in the way Americans invest their money meant it could no longer predict how much economic growth would be produced by a certain amount of growth in the money supply."

His alternatives were to ask people to buy health insurance on their own, a turkey sans wings, or to institute a national health plan, which surely would have snapped back into reality anyone who thought anti-Communism was dead. The ""employer mandate,"" as the plan is known in its current form, simply makes the current voluntary system a mandatory one, bringing into the fold employers who, for whatever reason, decline to pay for ""fringe"" benefits like health care.    No one can say how many policy mutations will occur before the Administration delivers a proposal next month, much less how nibbling by Congress will reconfigure it. The debate will likely be driven by the anxieties of small-business proprietors, who have learned the value of paying dues to leather-lunged organizations that bear their standard in Washington. Companies of all sizes are helping to float the impression floating over the debate -- which resembles a raucous graduate-school seminar -- is that employers will simply eat the cost of increased benefits and deduct the total from the bottom line.

Given the emotional power of the White House signing ceremony on Sept. 13 and the handshake between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the P.L.O., the subsequent lack of visible movement has caused a letdown among some people on both sides.

Citing the difficulty in keeping track of the changes in cable lineups, Nielsen has announced that it will not provide television ratings on an overnight basis until the cable confusion is resolved.

""What we concluded was more or less known to all sides."" But Professor Awartani is too modest. The report, produced under the auspices of the Institute for Social and Economic Policy at Harvard University, offers a glimmer of light in the gloom of the stalled peace talks.    The willingness of these politically connected experts to talk turkey about the economics of the unborn state may be a harbinger of diplomatic advances to come. At the very least it suggests that Palestine would be better prepared for economic autonomy than most new nations."

Near summer's end, most rivers -- including this one -- are low and fish are few. But over the last year, the art of catching fish with willowy rods and artificial insects fashioned from feathers and thread has captured thousands of new anglers and converts, producing record sales for equipment manufacturers, retailers and organizers of fly-fishing schools and trips. A Movie's Popularity    Many in the industry attribute their good fortune to the popularity of ""A River Runs Through It,"" Robert Redford's recent film version of Norman Maclean's resonant memoir about family and fly-fishing in Montana. Other industry experts point to the impact of advertisers who in recent years have used images of fly-fishing to sell products like cars, beer and boxer shorts. Still others believe that a generation uneasy about hunting has seized on fly-fishing as a way to get back to nature while indulging a primordial urge."

The appeals court, which had reopened the case last year on its own initiative, criticized the Justice Department, calling its prosecution ""careless at the very least."" It also aggressively questioned how Attorney General Janet Reno could have supported the legal position that Mr. Demjanjuk (pronounced dem-ahn-YUKE) should remain banished from the United States while the Federal courts reconsider their earlier order that had stripped him of his American citizenship. A Return to Ohio    The decision today means that Mr. Demjanjuk, a 73-year-old retired auto worker who was extradited to Israel in 1986 to face war-crime charges, will very likely wind up returning to his family in Ohio. He remains in a small prison cell near Tel Aviv for eight more days while the Israeli Government decides what to do with him. American prosecutors asked the court to stay its ruling so it could appeal it. But the court denied the request to await further review and its decision may make it impossible for American officials to block his return."

The tortuous talks in New York that culminated in the signing of the accord on Saturday by the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the military leader who overthrew him in September 1991, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, exposed the fractious nature of Haiti's politics and the skills and limits of its foreign partners."

John M. Shalikashvili, President Clinton's choice to be the top officer of the armed forces, gave strong support today for sending 25,000 American troops to Bosnia to help enforce any peace settlement reached there, but said the overall operation would cost $4 billion in the first year alone.   General Shalikashvili, a Polish-born artillery officer named to succeed Gen. Colin L. Powell as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that a force of 50,000 heavily armed NATO troops would have a good chance of success in such a mission, if the proper command structure was established and the warring factions committed themselves to observe an agreement.  A 'Tragic Association'    The general also said he had been shocked to learn that his father fought in World War II in a Nazi-organized unit commanded by the Waffen SS.

What they would like is a meeting with lots of understanding rather than accords that would corner them into taking tough economic steps.   For months, bureaucrats in Tokyo have been growing edgy over demands by other countries that Japan lift its economy out of recession and boost its imports with a big stimulus package to encourage spending. The United States has even asked Tokyo to commit itself to specific targets for reducing its huge trade surpluses."

Accounts of atrocities that were long suppressed, admissions of responsibility and expressions of condolences finally broke through the decades of evasions.   ""I myself believe it was a war of aggression, a war that was wrong,"" the new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, said in a deceptively simple statement, the first of its kind. It was just part of an outpouring of remembrances of the horrors Japan inflicted on the region in a war that is still the subject of surprisingly ambiguous feelings here."
