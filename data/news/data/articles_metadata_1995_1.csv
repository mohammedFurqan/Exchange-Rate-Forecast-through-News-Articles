PDA's, so the industry likes to insist, will be really useful devices, really, one of these days.   Devices like Newton from Apple Computer and Magic Link from Sony are already useful, in a limited way, right out of the box. They come with software including spreadsheets, contact managers, personal organizers and other handy programs, and the learning curve is not steep. But one problem with all of them has been getting information into and out of the devices. Attempts to develop systems for reading the user's handwriting have provoked a great deal of ridicule."

The overcast skies, the leafless trees, the dirty buildings and the fine dust blowing in from the surrounding plains form a monochrome landscape that accentuates the poverty and struggle in the faces of so many people here. But a familiar color dots this veil of gray -- the red of Coca-Cola.   It is the rare shop or kiosk in the capital here and throughout Romania that does not have a red circle poster with a Coke bottle in the middle, or a red awning, or red umbrellas, or windows lined in red stripes or red plastic cases stacked outside."

Can It Sell It?,"  THIS is the ultimate test for Monsanto. It was no mean feat to genetically alter bacteria so that they produce a cow hormone that increases milk output. And in the face of fierce objections from opponents of biotechnology, it took nearly a decade to win Food and Drug Administration approval to market the hormone. But a year after Monsanto began selling the hormone, it is clear that the biggest challenge of all will be recouping the hundreds of millions of dollars it has invested.    The stakes go far beyond the Monsanto Company and the dairy industry. The hormone -- which is known formally as bovine somatotropin, or BST, and goes by the brand name Posilac -- is the first genetically engineered product to be used to increase food production. And the consensus is that if a deep-pocketed giant like Monsanto cannot make a go of it, Wall Street will shy away from investments in food-industry biotechnology for years to come."

If announced price rises hold up, the price will jump to $600 in March and $675 in May, for a total increase of 37 percent this year.

While it is not unusual to see as isolated feature on women in the business arena, rarely does such a variety of articles on women's business and economic issues appear in a publication. The most intriguing aspect of these reports is that two feature women who have clearly crashed the glass ceiling, one summarizes the challenges women face on board committee assignments and the last outlines the problems of women starting their own businesses or merely surviving on the job market.

Apparently, the answer is yes. The stock of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has leaped 20 percent so far in 1995, rising despite reports of some insider selling late last year and in the face of mediocre performance from many of the stocks that Berkshire Hathaway owns.   Berkshire Hathaway, as every owner of the stock knows, is run by Warren E. Buffett, who does not believe in stock splits. That fact, plus the excellent record Mr. Buffett has compiled, explains why Berkshire Hathaway trades at levels never seen before in this country. The stock closed at $24,550 a share, down $275, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. When Mr. Buffett took over the company 30 years ago, the price was less than $20."

Sea-Land officials said yesterday that they planned to resume shipping on Feb. 22, and thought they would be able to move as much cargo as their ships carried before the earthquake. But that would still be but a fraction of the total shipments in and out of Kobe, and no other shipping company has announced plans to resume service."

Lilly, a pharmaceutical maker, cited rising sales of its Axid ulcer drug, Prozac antidepressant, Humulin insulin medication and Cefaclor antibiotic. Lilly said it expected per-share earnings of $1.26 to $1.32 in the first quarter ending Friday. That compares with an average estimate of $1.14 a share by 20 brokers surveyed by the First Call Corporation. In last year's first quarter, Lilly posted earnings from continuing operations of $1.04 a share, reduced by 14 cents to account for a recall of an oral antibiotic. In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Lilly shares closed up $3.125 at $76.75."

For many investors, this political hunting party may signal a time to bag some big game -- or to duck for cover.   Of course, the average person may pay more attention to the moral and economic aspects of the F.D.A. dispute than to its meaning for stocks. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has denounced the F.D.A. as the ""leading job-killer in America,"" for instance, while the agency's supporters have conjured up the specter of babies deformed by drugs like thalidomide under deregulation.

B.A.T. bought American Tobacco last month from American Brands Inc. and merged it with Brown & Williamson, based in Louisville, Ky. Brown & Williamson said yesterday that it had laid off about 1,230 full-time sales employees, of which 150 would be offered part-time positions. The company plans to eliminate another 450 research and administrative support jobs by phasing out American Tobacco operations in Chester, Va., and Stamford, Conn. Some of those employees will be offered new positions, the company said."

Because the shares of the two affiliate companies -- Bankers Life Holding and CCP Insurance -- have been depressed along with many other insurance stocks, analysts saw the move as way for Conseco to buy cheaply shares that could help improve its faltering earnings and perhaps be sold at a profit some day. Conseco, a insurance holding company, knows the operations of the two companies inside out, as it reorganized them in the early 1990's and continues to provide much of their management."

A big concern is that the economies and currencies of emerging-market countries like Mexico will be under pressure this year if investors decide to take their money to countries where the risks of losses are lower. Analysts say the current weakness of currencies in developed countries like Canada and Spain was also sending investors into more stable and stronger alternatives, in this case the yen and the mark."

Fine Wine on the Block.,"  LOOKING for an insouciant little Bordeaux with a supple body -- something, perhaps, with an unadorned bouquet, a hint of humus on the tongue and a finish of ripe pear with overtones of persimmon, plum and clover? Until recently, the only place New Yorkers could hope to buy such a bottle (with or without that elusive persimmon overtone) was ye olde friendlie neighborhood spirits shoppe. For after the end of Prohibition the State Legislature endowed liquor retailers with a monopoly on the wine trade, much the way 16th century monarchs parceled out monopolies in spices.   But in 1993 New York retailers specializing in upscale wines hammered out a deal with New York's two international art auction houses, which run wine exchanges in Europe and have long been lobbying Albany for a piece of the local action. Now anyone can auction wines if they can find an established retailer to serve as a partner. Indeed, New York City is on the verge of becoming the wine auction capital of America, rivaling the markets in Chicago and California in both variety and dollar volume."

Yeltsin, and the Administration called the war in Chechnya an impediment in Russian-American relations.   The White House aides cited the Chechen war as the main reason that Mr. Clinton wanted to put off the meeting, which was to have coincided with Russian ceremonies celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. But they said a second important reason was the President's reluctance to embark on yet another round of World War II commemorations abroad when he believes it would be more fitting to celebrate V-E Day at home."

In many cases, how many hours you drive may not be as important a contributing factor as how much sleep you had the night before or the quality of that sleep. The National Transportation Safety Board's report, which your story cites, includes an estimate of the incidence of truck driver-fatigue that is not substantiated by the research. In fact, in the materials accompanying its report, the board acknowledged that ""little data are available to estimate the incidence of fatigue in the less serious heavy truck accidents."" Unfortunately, this important qualifying statement was ignored in the rush to sensationalize the fatigue issue. THOMAS J.

But as they have been adapted to control computers, they have grown larger and increasingly complex: function keys often represent at least four different commands, depending on whether some combination of the shift, control or alt keys are pressed along with them.   The required contortions are thought to be one cause of the repetitive strain injuries to the arms and hands of people who spend long hours working at computers. Various remedies have been offered, including new keyboards that have different key configurations or are even split in two to ease arm and wrist strain. But now some former research scientists from Russia believe they have put their finger on the problem. Their solution: add foot controls to the computer interface."

As most students of information science know, the windows and pull-down menus first commercialized in Apple Computer's Lisa and Macintosh machines and later in Microsoft's Windows software were invented at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The companion mouse was conceived just up the road at SRI International, in Menlo Park, at roughly the same time.   To be sure, the software's desktop metaphor, with its file folders, documents and icons representing their paper equivalents, was a vast improvement over the command-line interface of earlier computer software. But using it has never been as intuitive as its proponents claimed, or there would be no need for ""Windows for Dummies"" and countless other help books. And the desktop metaphor becomes much less adequate when users venture off the desktop, onto a local area network or the Internet."

The first two are truly frightening ones, conjuring images of Social Security slashed in half, crippling taxes, a decimated national defense. But ""amendment"" -- what a breath of fresh air that one brings. ""A change for the better,"" Webster's defines it, ""a correction of errors."" No wonder the House wants to tack such a soothing word onto the other two, as it did officially last week, passing the amendment by a hefty margin. (Next it goes to the Senate, where it's close, and to the states, where it'll take years.) President Clinton, in that endless State of the Union speech -- at 81 minutes, the longest ever -- did manage to challenge his foes on this one, saying, Yes, by all means balance it, but tell people how you'll do it. All one could hear, though, was talk of amending, not that brutal balancing. 1995's Tax-Cut Star You'd think Christine Whitman's middle name was ""Tax Cut,"" not ""Todd."" It's been her battle cry from the start, and last week the Governor proudly declared that she'd reach her goal of a 30 percent cut in New Jersey's income tax by next January, a year earlier than she'd promised. Never mind that critics say she's just shifting the burden to local property taxes -- her message was clear: local governments are on their own. ""Property taxes,"" she said, ""reflect local spending decisions."" And the Republicans in Washington are clearly fans, for they chose her to beat up on President Clinton after his State of the Union speech -- only the day after her tax speech. Mr. Greenspan Is Watching You could never accuse the Federal Reserve of not being ""vigilant."" For the past year, it has kept on raising interest rates, each time sounding dire alarms about a too-bubbly economy, even as inflation snuggled in firmly below 3 percent. So when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, actually used the word last week -- saying, in Senate testimony, that various inflation signals are forcing the Fed to stay ""vigilant"" -- you could bet he was at it again. And Friday's report of a strong final quarter of 1994 could add fuel to his fire, even amid signals of a slowing economy. So when the Fed meets this Tuesday, no one should be surprised if it tightens the screws further. Let's just hope it doesn't make the patient scream, ""Recession!"" Super Ads? Well, Super Money    This is it. The Big Day. Anyone who has the strength to sit through that watching-paint-dry exercise called the Super Bowl will at last see the real show: the ads. What message, after all, could be so compelling that an advertiser would spend $1 million -- yes, $1 million -- to address those partying hordes for 30 fleeting seconds? The advertising, one executive said, has become ""a show in and of itself."" Why, even Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards (who lost big in November's Super Bowl) will be out there, pitching Doritos. Can this possibly pay? Look at Nike. It's in for 90 seconds. That's $3 million. Suppose it makes $10 on each pair of shoes. Are 300,000 inspired fans going to rush out and buy Nikes? Chrysler Doesn't Want It to End Can the auto boom keep rolling forever? Of course not. People will finally get rid of the old clunkers and won't buy as many new cars -- especially at those prices. It's been nice for Detroit, though, and Chrysler would love to have it last a bit longer. But last week it voiced its worry that if the Federal Reserve raises rates again, it could tip the balance and bring back the bad old days. But face it: things are already slowing down. Ford just shut a few assembly plants temporarily, and discounts, rebates and price wars are sneaking back into Detroit's vocabulary. INTERNATIONAL Hunting Terrorists' Cash With Republicans in the spotlight, President Clinton, naturally, wants to take some decisive actions. That may have been on his mind last week when he ordered a freeze on the American assets of Mideast terrorist groups. On the surface, it makes sense. Like most things, terror isn't free -- so it's logical to ""follow the money"" (as the Watergate folks used to say). Trouble is, there probably isn't much terrorist money in American banks, at least not that the Treasury will find. Can you imagine walking into your bank and saying, ""Hi. I'm with Amalgamated Terrorists. What's the minimum for free checking?"" Said one Treasury official: ""I don't anticipate seizing any large sums."" It Isn't About Mexico ""It is not just about Mexico,"" Alan Greenspan said last week, stressing the global impact that Mexico's crisis could have and urging the Senate to approve $40 billion in loan guarantees. And that global scale was underscored when the I.M.F. tentatively approved a $7.8 billion loan to Mexico, the group's biggest ever. And as Washington ponders those guarantees, one point became clear: there will be no linkage with any border crackdown on illegal immigrants. Mexican officials adamantly denied that this would be part of any deal, and American officials backed right away from the idea. Health Care XXIX: The Merger Yes, health care companies have seen the frugal future and have been preparing for it -- merging, merging, merging to cut costs. But last week this craze really hit the big time as Glaxo offered $14 billion for Wellcome. If these British companies join forces, they'll create the world's largest drug maker, even leaping past giant Merck. (Glaxo gets a big chunk of its sales from Zantac, its ulcer treatment, while Wellcome's stand-bys are Zovirax, for herpes, and AZT.) The deal would also be up there with the biggest mergers ever -- and half the level of the biggest, the $30 billion Nabisco merger. If, that is, it happens. Wellcome tried to say no, thanks, later in the week, but that might be tough, since its biggest shareholder -- with a 39.5 percent stake -- is all for it. COMPANIES Soft Drinks: Now There Are 3 Speaking of balancing the budget, here's an idea: since no one needs soft drinks, Americans could just take the staggering sum they spend on them -- $49 billion yearly, fully a third of the global soda market -- and send it to the Treasury. What a dent that would make! No, sadly, soft drinks are right up there with Social Security as American icons. And speaking of soft drinks, a third giant was born last week in that huge industry as Dr Pepper/Seven-Up agreed to be acquired by Cadbury Schweppes (Canada Dry, Crush, etc.) for $1.7 billion. The combined company would have 17 percent of the American market, nearly in a league with Coca-Cola (41 percent) and Pepsi (32 percent). And at $33 a share for Dr Pepper, that's quite a run-up from $15, which was the price when the stock was first offered to the public just two years ago. Spectrum: Out of Its Misery? In one short year, Spectrum Information Technologies went from being an obscure data-transmission company to being the talk of the technology town. For a brief spell, that talk was aglow with promise, for the mighty John Sculley had signed on -- it couldn't get better than that. But soon the talk turned sour, for an S.E.C. inquiry materialized, Mr. Sculley beat a hasty retreat, woe piled on woe. And last week came perhaps the final straw, as Spectrum and three of its four operating subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Don't Forget the Oranges Pretty soon you'll be able to live on orange juice -- it'll be loaded with so much good stuff that you'll be the picture of nutritional perfection if you consume nothing else all day. Just think: not long ago, orange juice was nothing but juice from oranges. How primitive! Marketers have since come to their senses, throwing in vitamins here, calcium there, to make you feel truly virtuous when you drink it. And last week Tropicana took the Battle of the Oranges to new heights, introducing juices fortified with vitamins A, C and E, calcium, and even fiber. Everything but a CD player and an alarm system. Finding That Cloudy Lining It's called the expectations game. You expect sleet, it's partly sunny, you're ecstatic; you expect a sparkling sky, a few clouds appear, you're in a funk. Compaq Computer is flying so high it just surged past Apple and I.B.M. in personal computer sales worldwide, and last week it came out with some sparkling numbers -- quarterly earnings up 61 percent. On this news, its stock proceeded to plunge $5, or 12 percent -- and slid even more the rest of the week, to end at $35.625. What happened? Analysts, it seems, expected 94 cents a share, so the reported 90 cents -- mighty as it was -- somehow became bad news. But it could well be broader than that -- market psychology has ""turned on technology stocks,"" said one analyst, and that means that any whiff of gloom can send them down."

The egalitarian vision at Kiwi worked wonders for customer service, as pilots helped to clean up the planes and flight attendants bought flowers for the planes' bathrooms.

Birdcage liner. Fish wrap. That kind of thing.   But Judge Don Gladstone of the Municipal Court in Sparks, Nev., could earn a place in the antimedia hall of fame with a recent ruling. He made a formal determination that the local paper in Sparks qualified as ""garbage, rubbish or waste"" under the law.   It seems that a Mr. Donald Glock, a resident of Sparks, which is on the outskirts of Reno, had made it clear that he did not want The Daily Sparks Tribune left on his driveway, either by the neighborhood 12-year-old newspaper carrier or anyone else. The 7,000-circulation paper, like many other publications, sometimes gives out free copies to attract subscribers.   This promotional tactic definitely did not work with Mr. Glock. He filed a criminal complaint. According to legal documents, ""Mr. Glock received three (3) unsolicited newspapers on his driveway between May 2, 1994 and Nov. 17, 1994.""   The City Attorney pursued the case under section 7.08.040 of the Sparks municipal code, which declares it unlawful to ""deposit, or cause to be deposited, any garbage, rubbish or waste"" within the city limits.   After a trial, Judge Gladstone found the paper guilty and fined it $1,000 plus $100 in costs.   Randy C. Frisch, president of the Sparks Tribune Publishing Company, the newspaper's parent, filed an appeal in January arguing First Amendment protection to distribute newspapers. The Nevada Press Association has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Sparks Tribune.    Publishers in several states have resisted littering laws that aimed to free homeowners from the annoyance of unwanted newspaper deliveries. But in the Sparks case, the constitutional battle seems to be quite personal.   Mr. Frisch said Judge Gladstone was biased.   Why? ""Because I have spent six years writing editorials about how incompetent the judge is,"" Mr. Frisch explained.   Judge Gladstone said he decided each case on its legal merits and would not respond to Mr. Frisch. But he hinted that the publisher simply resented his independence. ""I work for the City of Sparks,"" Judge Gladstone said. ""I do not work for a newspaper or any other group.""    Despite the heat of the dispute, however, Mr. Frisch insisted that he was not insulted by the legal interpretation that his newspaper could be described as garbage.    ""You have to have respect for the interpreter before you can be insulted,"" he said."

There was no official confirmation of the killing, but he would be the highest-ranking officer to be slain by militants since a military-backed coup set off an Islamic revolt there three years ago.   Islamic militants have also taken responsibility for blowing up three vital bridges in and around Algiers and killing at least 11 well-known figures in the arts and civil affairs in the last week. Among them were the director of the national theater; a composer of rai, an Arab music with a fast beat; and a leader of the feminist movement.   So far the oil industry, crucial to the country's flagging economy, has been spared. But diplomats and experts on Algerian affairs say the security situation seems to be spinning out of control, raising the prospect of an all-out guerrilla war involving big armed clashes across the country, including the capital.   European governments -- particularly that of France, which as Algeria's former colonial ruler has a large population of North Africans -- are expressing nervousness and confusion over the rapid deterioration in security. France's President, Francois Mitterrand, urged the Government this month to negotiate with the help of European mediators, but the Algerian leadership rebuffed that notion as outside interference in its affairs.   Diplomats say the ouster of Algeria's military-dominated Government could profoundly undermine the Governments of neighboring Morocco and Tunisia, leaving Europe to face a phalanx of Islamic states just across the Mediterranean modeled politically after Iran.    Europeans also fear the possibility of an influx of frightened middle-class North African migrants averse to the idea of living under Islamic rule.   Underlining those worries, Algerian militants carried out a virtually unparalleled raid on a border post in neighboring Tunisia last week, killing seven guards. The Armed Islamic Group, one of the most violent of the Algerian factions, took responsibility for that attack today.   In tracts distributed in Algiers, the group said the cross-border raid was a ""warning"" to Tunisia's staunchly secular Government to ""stop helping the enemies of Islam.""   The violent revolt in Algeria began in early 1992, after a military-backed Government seized power and canceled a final round of elections that the Islamic movement seemed sure of winning. The new leadership banned the Islamic political movement and imposed severe limits on civil freedoms like public gatherings and writings critical of the Government.   Since then, clashes between secularists and Islamic militants have taken at least 30,000 lives, with security officers, Government officials, foreigners and, now, secular cultural figures among the main targets.   But the death toll last week, which began to surface in Algerian newspaper reports only today, represents a striking acceleration of the attacks.    French and Algerian analysts said the number killed last week exceeded 500 people, including militants, soldiers, urban civilians and Berbers in the mountainous Kabyl region in the north, where opposition to the fundamentalist campaign is strong.   The latest spate of large-scale attacks in the capital began with a suicide bombing on Jan. 30 near a police headquarters downtown that killed 42 people and wounded 256, mostly innocent civilians and pedestrians.   Often it takes several days to piece together events in Algeria. Few foreign journalists operate there because of the threat to their safety, and the Algerian Government often withholds information on rebel attacks and military operations.   The senior military officer reported killed on Sunday was Col. Mrawi Jilali, a ranking army intelligence officer responsible for issuing reports to the public and news organizations. According to several Algerian officials, he was one of the closest aides to the intelligence division's chief, Gen. Tewfik Madani, whose movements are a closely guarded secret.   The killing suggested that the fundamentalists are refining their sources of information and their infiltration of circles of the country's top leadership. Opposition figures said Colonel Jilali was under surveillance for three days before the shooting in the Kouba district, on the edge of the capital.   In December, Islamic militants took their war to France, hijacking an Air France jetliner from Algiers to Marseilles and killing three passengers before French commandos stormed the plane and killed the hijackers.    For the French Government, the most alarming aspect of the hijacking may be that intelligence officials now suspect that Iran helped instigate it .   In an article this week in the French weekly Paris Match, a former journalist and novelist, Gerard de Villiers, reports that French intelligence officials are saying that Iran has linked up with Islamic militants in Algeria ""on an operational level,"" lending advice and support.   Mr. de Villiers quotes French anti-terrorist intelligence officials as saying that early in December, weeks before the Christmas Eve hijacking began, Iran's minister of secret and intelligence services, Ali Fallahian, met with representatives of the Islamic Armed Group, the Palestinian organization Hamas and the Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon known as the Party of God. All three groups are militantly Islamic in their orientation and receive advice and financial backing from Iran.   Mr. de Villiers wrote that French intelligence agents were tipped off about the meeting, which took place in Tripoli, Lebanon, by Syrian counterparts who watch Lebanon carefully.    Until recently, French intelligence believed that Algerian militants received some training in Iran and in the Sudan and some financial support. But the meeting in Lebanon appears to have taken relations to a higher level.   Last month, France's confusion over what to do about Algeria was evident. President Mitterrand's call for talks between militants and the army to end the conflict broke with a French policy of supporting the Algerian Government in its effort to eradicate militants. Mr. Mitterrand was immediately contradicted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who said the war was an internal Algerian affair.   Nonetheless, the attacks on vital targets in Algiers have shaken confidence among French officials that the Algerian military can still control the situation in the country of 30 million, where unemployment runs close to 40 percent. The economic misery helps the militants' drive to recruit volunteers to overthrow the Government.   Among the three vital bridges blown up in and around the capital in the last two days was one linking a neighborhood where the army headquarters and main armed forces hospital are located.   Any lingering hopes that the Government might renew a bid for negotiations with jailed leaders of the Islamic opposition have faded somewhat with reports in a London-based daily that the movement's leader, Abassi Madani, who was moved from house arrest to a military jail this month, has undergone an operation to remove a serious cancerous growth from his gums or jaw. The Algerian Government has not confirmed the report, which appeared in the Arabic-language paper Asharq Al Awsat.   Mr. Madani was moved from house arrest to a military jail earlier this month. It is not clear under what conditions he has been held following the surgery."

In recent years, banks, securities firms and even county governments have suffered billions of dollars in losses all attributed to bad judgment -- or misfeasance - by one employee. Nicholas W. Leeson -- A 28-year-old trader from the Singapore office of Barings, has been accused of making trades that have led to at least $950 million in losses, causing the collapse of the venerable British investment bank.   Mr. Leeson used futures contracts to bet heavily that the Japanese stock market would stay level. When the earthquake in Kobe caused the market to tumble instead, Mr. Leeson tried doubling up his bets, only to sustain further losses. Mr. Leeson disappeared last week, and is now being sought by authorities. Victor Gomez -- Another trader felled by the overseas markets. In January, when Chemical Bank announced that it had suffered $70 million in losses in trading Mexican pesos, the bank blamed a trader, which people close to the bank identified as Mr. Gomez, a vice president in its foreign exchange group. The bank said the trader had loaded up on more pesos than he was authorized to purchase. Those holdings suffered staggering losses after the sudden devaluation of the peso on Dec. 20 and its subsequent further fall.  Robert L. Citron -- As the treasurer of Orange County, Mr. Citron won plenty of fans for his aggressive and daring financial style that produced hefty profits for the county investment pool. But the fund was borrowing heavily to speculate on interest rates staying low or declining. As the rates rose last year, Mr. Citron's trading strategy collapsed in disaster. Losses reached into the billions, and Orange County filed for bankruptcy.    Now, Mr. Citron is out of a job. But the fault for the catastrophe does not lie with him, he has said. After 24 years of trading billions of dollars in the county fund, Mr. Citron said he was an unsophisticated investor. The fault, he said, lay with his brokers at Merrill Lynch & Company.  Joseph Jett -- The former chief Government bond trader at Kidder Peabody & Company was celebrated by the firm for his profit-making ability. Then, in April 1994, Kidder made a stunning announcement: Mr. Jett's profits were all a fraud. The firm said that, by using an accounting loophole, Mr. Jett manufactured phony bond trading profits totaling $350 million. In truth, Mr. Jett's real trading had lost $100 million, the firm said. The phantom profits not only improved the performance of Mr. Jett's Government trading desk, but brought him a $9 million bonus in 1993. Mr. Jett has denied any wrongdoing.   Earlier this year, Mr. Jett was notified that the enforcement staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission had recommended civil charges against him. Kidder, Peabody, which at the time was a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, has since been sold to the Paine Webber Group.  Paul W. Mozer -- The former head of the Government trading desk at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Mozer had the reputation of being the most aggressive trader in the business. In 1991, when the Government imposed rules limiting the amount of securities that a single dealer could purchase in a Treasury auction, Mr. Mozer elected to side step the rules. Using the names of Salomon customers who had not authorized any purchases, he submitted false bids in a number of Treasury auctions. Using the other names allowed Mr. Mozer to purchase far more of the Treasury securities than he was allowed.   The scheme was disclosed by the firm in August 1991, and Mr. Mozer was dismissed. Salomon's senior management, including John H. Gutfreund, then the chairman, was forced to resign. The firm ultimately paid a $290 million fine. Mr. Mozer was sentenced to four months in prison and was banned from the industry for life.  Howard A. Rubin -- The former head of mortgage securities trading at Merrill Lynch , Mr. Rubin was accused by the firm of causing a $377 million loss in 1987. The firm said that Mr. Rubin failed to disclose that he had taken a $500 million position in a risky form of mortgage-backed securities called ""principal only,"" while selling the corresponding ""interest only"" to Merrill clients. The firm said that they had instructed Mr. Rubin not to take such positions, and only learned of it when the losses were mounting.   In 1990, the S.E.C. suspended Mr. Rubin from the industry for nine months. Merrill Lynch responded to the crisis by establishing a risk management group that reports directly to the firm's senior management, rather than through the trading managers. KURT EICHENWALD"

After that it was quality circles. Today, the hottest trend sweeping Corporate America is re-engineering. Ever since Michael Hammer and James Champy wrote their 1993 book, ""Re-engineering the Corporation,"" thousands of companies have rushed to jump on the bandwagon. At business schools, too, re-engineering is all the rage. Academic pundits ceaselessly chant the new mantra, professing to show companies the way to attain greater heights of productivity and customer satisfaction.  But while most academics just preach the virtues of re-engineering, Thomas P. Gerrity, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, has been practicing it. Since taking over the deanship in 1990, Mr. Gerrity, a former professor and entrepreneur, has managed to push through the most far-reaching curriculum changes of any top business school in the country."

A weaker-than-expected employment report yesterday was the clearest sign yet that the Fed had done its job in keeping inflation subdued. The rally showed that investors are willing to lock into longer maturities if they are confident that the economy has cooled and that lower rates lie ahead.A flurry of buying sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to its lowest level since Sept. 8. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. Other maturities also rallied strongly.    The price of the 30-year bond jumped 1 9/32 percentage points, to 9817/32 , for a yield of 7.62 percent, down from 7.74 percent on Thursday. For bondholders, it meant that for every $1,000 invested, they made $12.81.    The Labor Department reported yesterday that the nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent last month from 5.4 percent in December as the economy created the fewest jobs in nearly a year. Only 136,000 jobs were added to the payrolls outside of the farm sector, the smallest number since the 101,000 gain in January 1994.    The report, analysts said, provided compelling evidence that the economy was finally beginning to lose momentum, dragged down by the cumulative weight of the Fed's seven increases in short-term rates since a year ago.     Analysts and traders said they saw less need for the Fed, which raised rates on Wednesday by 50 basis points, to move again. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.    ""We all recognize they're going to step back a little bit,"" Richard Schlanger, who helps manage $1.5 billion of bonds at Pioneering Management in Boston, told Bloomberg Business News.    Indeed, the spread between the yield of the 2-year note and that of the 30-year bond was 48 basis points yesterday, up from 38 basis points Thursday. A widening spread indicates that the market does not expect another Fed rate increase for some time.    The weakness of the employment report caught some investors by surprise, causing some large market participants to cover short positions.    Short-covering occurs when traders buy back borrowed securities they had previously sold short in the hopes of profiting from lower prices. But if prices begin to rise, instead of fall, short-sellers needs to cover their positions by buying back securities to limit their losses.    While the employment report cheered a battered bond market, economists noted that the data also disclosed some signs of inflation, which could halt the rally, or limit follow-through buying in the next session.    Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, noted that the report showed substantial increases in the workweek and in hourly earnings. ""So, if you combined the hourly earnings with the lengthened workweek, and the additional number of people working,"" he said, ""you'll find a big increase in personal income for the month."" Such data suggest then, he said, that the economy is still very strong.    Analysts also noted that the market faces a difficult task of absorbing a heavy supply of new securities next week. The Treasury is selling $40 billion of new 3-year, 10-year and 30-year debt securities as part of its quarterly borrowing needs, on top of the $27.6 billion in bills that it sells regularly each week.    ""Next week's refunding will be more difficult to sell,"" Mr. Sherman said, ""because investors would be buying securities after a very substantial rally. And history shows that is not a good time to buy, especially if there are no changes in the fundamentals of the market. You still have several months before the last tightening by the Fed takes effect.""    In when-issued trading, the 3-year note to be sold on Tuesday was being offered at a price to yield 7.34 percent, while the 10-year note to be sold on Wednesday was offered at a price to yield 7.50 percent. The 30-year bond, the final leg of the refunding on Thursday, was offered at a price to yield 7.58 percent.    Robin Mesch, chief analyst for Thomson Research in Boston, saw yesterday as a good opportunity for a bear market rally. ""I think the market has been overdone all week long,"" she said."

Yeltsin prepares to go before a joint meeting of Parliament on Thursday to ask the country ""to believe in him again,"" as one newspaper put it, there are muted but growing concerns about his health.

Instead, our party has often argued dogmatically that cuts in the capital gains tax, for example, benefit only the wealthy, who can afford to play the stock markets. This approach ignores the singular economic fact that only by increasing and tapping the savings of the broad majority of Americans -- middle-income working families -- can we hope to finance a genuinely productive and globally competitive economy.  Households earning between $25,000 and $105,000 account for fully two-thirds of total family income in America. This is where the money is, so it must also be the primary source of our nation's seed capital. Yet it seems a great struggle for the middle class to save for the long term. We need to provide comprehensible incentives that convince average Americans that capital gains can work for them, too. I have a proposal -- the Middle-Class Savings and Capital Gains Act of 1995 -- that cuts the capital gains tax in a way that benefits everyone, especially the typical working household."

First, a left jab from two professors who released a study in May showing that 25-cent spreads were the norm on the Nasdaq stock trading system, while 12.5-cent spreads were the norm for the big exchanges. (Brokers make their money using spreads, which let them buy and sell at different prices. The larger the spread, the larger the fee.) Then, a right hook from plaintiffs in a wave of class-action lawsuits against the main market makers -- touched off by the professors' study, which Nasdaq said was flawed. And finally, an uppercut from the Justice Department, which said in October that it was investigating the dealers who make Nasdaq markets, the apparent focus being on a suspicion of price fixing. Joseph Jett's Fame as a Phantom    One way or another, it seems, Orlando Joseph Jett was bound to gain fame in 1994. Early in the year, the 36-year-old chief government bond trader at Kidder, Peabody (who goes by his middle name) was declared Employee of the Year -- and was rewarded with a $9 million bonus. But before summer, he was held out as a villain who is said to have exploited glitches in the brokerage firm's accounting systems to take credit for $350 million in phantom profits, or profits that existed only on paper. Kidder's parent, General Electric, quickly reduced previously reported profits by $210 million and then sold off the brokerage firm, all the while pointing to Mr. Jett. Later the New York Stock Exchange said it was punishing Mr. Jett -- he refused to testify before the exchange's enforcement division -- by banishing him from trading securities or working for any employer affiliated with the exchange. This has essentially barred him from Wall Street, which suffers from herd mentality, at least in this regard. (So far Mr. Jett, who has strongly denied any wrongdoing, is a phantom defendant: No charges have been filed in the complex case, which is being investigated by the S.E.C. and the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan and promises more drama this year.) Read at Your Own Risk    It only began creeping into the vernacular in the spring of 1994; by year-end, mention of the word could jangle the nerves of a wide set of investors. (WARNING: The following material is not recommended for readers with high blood pressure.) Derivatives. Derivatives -- financial instruments with values linked to some underlying asset like a bond, stock or index -- stung corporations like Gibson Greetings and Procter & Gamble, mutual funds run by Piper Jaffray and Paine Webber, and municipalities across the country. But nowhere was the failure of investment plans using some derivatives more dramatic than in Orange County, Calif. The county's risky plan, which also included heavy borrowing, led to the biggest municipal bankruptcy ever. Schoolchildren may get a chilling lesson in financial tomfoolery: the county's schools, which were required by state law to put their funds through the county's investment pool, may run out of money to pay salaries. A Lighter Load to the Bank    No need to enlist Brinks trucks to pick up bonuses this year, folks. Your Range Rovers will do. Goldman, Sachs, one of Wall Street's richest investment firms, prided itself on outdoing its rivals in past industry downturns. But not this time: Goldman is struggling to make money as are other firms that rely heavily on bond trading, including Lehman Brothers, Salomon Brothers and Bear, Stearns. They were all blind-sided by rising interest rates last year. Goldman's elite securities traders and investment bankers are seeing their discretionary bonuses chopped by as much as 75 percent. (In good years the bonuses can be several times their annual salaries, which are often in the high six figures, at least.) The firm had its first round of layoffs in years in 1994, and more are expected this year. Goldman's support staff is also seeing smaller bonuses; they are down to 8 percent from 30 percent a year ago. Prudential's Burgeoning Tab    What Prudential executives thought would be put behind them last year for a relatively small price of $330 million is still an albatross -- one that's costing the insurance giant at least twice as much. In the 1980's the company's Prudential Securities unit defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors who joined the limited partnerships it had set up and billed as safe. Small investors lost billions. Claims against the company's $660 million restitution fund are still flowing in: at the middle of last month, the number of filings was higher than ever. More than 56,000 claimants have already received $397 million, while more than 152,000 have filed claims. Filings can be made as late as a year from the postmark date on the forms Prudential began mailing a year ago this month. If the $660 million doesn't cut it, Prudential will have to pony up even more."

Long Live the Economy.  Two of last week's big stories seemed strikingly at odds. Republicans stormed Capitol Hill with the glee of schoolchildren entering a long-padlocked playground, carried to glory on the shoulders of a failed economy. But hard on the heels of that triumphant return came news that that same economy finished the year on a mighty note: the unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent, and more than a quarter million jobs were added in December. On top of that, there was a huge upward revision that made November's rise in payrolls the biggest in seven years. All this brought 1994's payroll expansion to 3.5 million, over a million more than in 1993 and the strongest in a decade. Now it might be logical to expect that such news, a clear inflation threat, would spook the markets. But in the bond market, rates actually fell a bit, and stock prices rose strongly."

Shares of Philip Morris dropped $1.375, to $57.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. On Wednesday, United States District Judge Okla Jones rejected defense requests to have an appeals court review rulings by Judge Jones's predecessor in the New Orleans case, named for the plaintiff, Dianne Castano. One ruling that the cigarette companies are challenging said that liability suits were not barred by the traditional tobacco defense of pre-emption, which says that federally mandated health warning labels bar consumers from making health-impairment claims against tobacco companies. Judge Jones is expected to rule within weeks on a more important plaintiff motion to have the case granted class-action status, which means it would represent millions of smokers who say they are addicted."

But their awareness of the intense interest in this sprawling computer network was heightened in April when two Arizona lawyers received death threats after they posted an ad for their services -- in the wrong place: on thousands of cyberspace ""bulletin boards"" called news groups. Now, on an ""acceptable"" advertising zone called the World Wide Web, everyone -- Adobe, Compuserve and MCI for starters -- is trying to get in on the act. One company has even invented electronic cash. It's meant to be transferable with clicks on a computer screen. Its inventors also say it will protect spenders' privacy. An Empire That's Likely to Strike It Rich    In Hollywood, where breathing is synonymous with hawking a movie deal of one sort or another, one threesome seems poised to succeed with a pop-culture empire like none before. The Disney expatriate Jeffrey Katzenberg, the movie powerhouse Steven Spielberg and the record king David Geffen made plans for a new movie studio last year, in the biggest merger of Hollywood talent since Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith created the United Artists movie empire 75 years ago. The three millionaires one-upped Mr. Chaplin and his cohorts, though, by forming a precedent-setting TV production company with Capital Cities/ABC. The venture will make TV industry history because it will be the first in which a broadcast network shares advertising income and other revenue with an outside producer. Sony Turmoil Could Make a Camera Blink    Every time Sony turned around last year, it lost another big name. Jon Peters, who along with Peter Guber once headed Sony's motion picture studio, ended his 4 1/2-year affiliation with Sony. Mr. Guber -- he became a multimillionaire when Sony bought his and Mr. Peters's company, Guber-Peters Entertainment -- left Sony Pictures, the studio that in the last year or so was drained by flops like ""Last Action Hero,"" to follow his ""dreams."" (With ""Philadelphia"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" to his Sony credit, Mr. Guber plans to set up a company that would create films, TV programs and other entertainment.) And Akio Morita, who co-founded Sony and guided it through 22 years of successes that included the oft-imitated Walkman and a key role in the development of the compact disk, resigned because of health problems. Is Fox in a Pickle or Not?    Can Rupert Murdoch get himself out of this one? The close of a year in which Mr. Murdoch's Fox network outbid CBS for N.F.L. football and lured away affiliated stations from ABC, CBS and NBC saw Fox get a paw of sorts caught in a Federal Communications Commission trap. Fox has been challenged by NBC and the N.A.A.C.P., both of which say its structure violates an F.C.C. policy limiting foreign ownership of TV stations to 25 percent. Fox is owned by the News Corporation, which is based in Australia. Aha! But control of Fox is held by Mr. Murdoch, its chairman, who became an American citizen before his deal for Fox was completed. Fox noted that the F.C.C. already approved the ownership structure -- in 1986. The F.C.C. has been as tight-lipped as a recluse fur trapper about its investigation. Mr. Murdoch has vowed to challenge NBC's licenses. Disney's Small and Eventful World    No one knows this tune better than Walt Disney: It's a world of laughter (all the way to the bank with wildly high proceeds from ""The Lion King""), a world of tears (for its president, Frank Wells, who died in a helicopter crash last year). It's a world of hopes (for buying a television network) and a world of fears (about failing with a historical theme park bordering Civil War battle sites like Bull Run). . . . . Would Someone Put a Leash on Viacom?    In July, Viacom gobbled up Paramount. Two months later, it absorbed Blockbuster Entertainment. Viacom's chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, called his company a ""global media colossus."" No kidding.

Although the United Nations peacekeeping contingent will consist largely of American troops and be led by an American general, there are also questions whether the new international force, operating under a different set of rules, is equal to the challenge it will inherit."
