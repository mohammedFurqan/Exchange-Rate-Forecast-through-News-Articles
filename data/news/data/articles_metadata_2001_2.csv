I've Had It Forever,"THERE are those who will tell you that hiding purchases from your spouse is a bad thing. Until recently, I was fully prepared to be one of those critics.     I was ready to skewer those women who hide their shopping bags behind their couches just as their mothers did. (Get past your parents' pathetic money script, ladies.) I planned to wag my finger at husbands who secretly fritter away hundreds of dollars at monthly poker games. (Come on, boys. We still admire your big muscles and manly wallet even if you lose at poker.) I knew that within many a covert spender lay jumbo-sized vices -- like adultery.    But just as I was climbing on my high horse, I noticed something strange. Everyone is pretty darn cheerful about this supposedly deep, dark disorder.     Ellen Perry, president of Family Office Solutions, a financial consulting practice in Washington, said concealment often signified trouble in a relationship. ''It's all tied up around the base issues: fear, power and jealousy,'' she said. But the conversation lightened considerably when we started giggling about the contortions some women perform to avoid the dreaded ''Is that new?'' question. With every other woman I talked to, the giggles started immediately.     And why not? One friend puts her Saks designer clothes in plastic dry-cleaning bags, both to disguise and to  explain their immaculate newness. She also hides the bill for the joint Visa card, roundly denouncing a lax billing policy when her husband asks why the bill hasn't yet arrived. Another friend hid her collagen injections for more than a year, timing the red, puffy aftereffects to coincide with her husband's business trips.    My sister, Betsy Russell, 50, of Greensboro, Ga., who has camouflaged her purchases for so long that it has become second nature, can catalog entire periods of her life according to the prevailing method of deception. The expensive outfits by St. John, each costing more than a computer, were easy to hide: the secret was to buy every piece in black, the completely husband-proof color. Over the years, Betsy has become expert at disposing of telltale boxes and packaging, but she only recently perfected a new-shoe sleight of hand. She places a just-out-of-the-box designer shoe on each perfectly manicured hand, walks out to her driveway, bends over and scrapes the soles on the gravel.    We know this is silly. And though there should be a convenient pattern here -- that women without their own income are more prone to hide purchases, for example -- it doesn't  seem to exist. Wealthy women, wives who run the family finances and women who earn more than their husbands tend to hide purchases as readily as women on allowances. As Juliet Johnson, 42, a voice-over performer in Short Hills, N.J., who says she is less than frank with her husband about -- gasp! -- her late fees on credit cards, explained: ''It's not because I'm spending joint money. It's because I don't want to be judged on how I'm spending my money.''   IS taking a brief vacation from spousal judgment a sign of marital decay? Or just one of the ways  that women carve out a little privacy from all that togetherness and sharing they do most of the time? There is a friendly, unspoken competition under the surface of most marriages: the Who Is Working Harder Contest. You are both in the harness, pulling for all you are worth. If one of you spends $130 for a body massage and a pedicure, the partner suddenly feels that his or her yoke is uncomfortably tight, the load a little unbearable and your behavior just a touch unfair. Sometimes it is easier to keep those personal indulgences off the ledger.     You may have noticed in this column that there are no men hiding shopping bags, dissembling about the cost of their golf lesson or pretending that their new suit was on sale. There are two reasons. First, many don't do it. In fact, in the 75 families with whom Ms. Perry has worked, not one of the men feels guilty about his purchases. ''If they buy an extravagant boat or a fancy car, they call up all their friends to come see it,'' she said. ''They get a huge amount of joy from it.''    Second, men are underrepresented here because their definition of hiding differs very conveniently from their wives'. Of the dozen men with whom I talked, only one admitted to any spending deceit. But ask a man if he tells his wife about the cost of his night at Hooters, the $250 he lost on golf-course bets or his January investment in Nasdaq stocks, and he'll say no. There is no guilt, no sheepishness and definitely no giggles. What I detect in their tone is reproach, disappointment that I have failed to grasp who they really are: ''Surely you don't think a man like me needs to discuss such trivial expenditures with his wife?''     Actually, they are right. Every female hider said she did not care about her husband's extravagances. And the men? Would they roar if they discovered a hidden lode of new purchases? Not at all. Or so they said. Maybe I'll try it out on my husband with that afternoon at the spa I have been coveting. Nah. Let's just keep that between you and me.  "

Both the state and central governments had guaranteed that they would pay the bills for the huge power plant if the electricity board failed to do so, but are refusing on the ground that the company owes a penalty for a technical failure to meet other contractual terms. The dispute now goes to a conciliation panel, and, if that fails, to arbitration in London. American diplomats have warned that the government's failure to live up to the guarantee could endanger future foreign investment in India.
