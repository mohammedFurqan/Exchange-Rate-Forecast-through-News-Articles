Our computers are connected to the Internet by a cable modem and a Linksys wireless access point. I want to buy a new cordless phone, but I am worried that it may disrupt the network.

The most common wireless networks for home users, 802.11b and g, can sometimes interfere with some cordless telephones because they use the 2.4-gigahertz frequency to broadcast signals from the base station to a computer or handset. Other devices like baby monitors or older microwave ovens can also disrupt a wireless network. Although interference from other electronic products may not block the wireless network signal entirely, it can make the network slow and balky.  "
