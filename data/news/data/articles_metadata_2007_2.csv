I did. But it’s no surprise. The job of photographer and photo editor has become exponentially more difficult this season as all of the teams except Ferrari have ceased to use tobacco sponsorship. Bahrain was the first race of the season at which Ferrari chose to display the name of its tobacco sponsor. It is not only the tobacco companies and the teams – except Ferrari and its sponsor – who have decided to fall in line with legislation that is quickly expanding worldwide against tobacco sponsorship, it is also much of the print media – although not so much television. So it is that many newspapers and magazines no longer use images of cars with tobacco sponsors. Moreover, it is clear to me that Ferrari’s very occasional use of its tobacco sponsor’s name and logo this year is actually going to seriously backfire against Ferrari, its tobacco sponsor and Formula One in general. It has already started."

The London judge, Peter Smith, ruled that Mr. Chiluba, in power from 1991 to 2001, “was uniquely positioned to stop corruption” in government, but that he elected instead to join in it. Zambia’s government sued in London because it alleged that Mr. Chiluba and his associates had bought assets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Mr. Chiluba said in a statement that he did not recognize a British court’s authority in Zambian issues, arguing that the case circumvented Zambia’s justice system. Other African experts said the verdict, the first against a current or former head of state, could set an anticorruption precedent."

The money was transferred from Banco Delta Asia, a small family-owned bank in Macao, in the first step to return the money to the original account holders, the officials said. Under pressure from the United States, the Macao government in September 2005 ordered that about $25 million belonging to either North Korean state agencies or businesses with links to North Korea be frozen in the Macao bank. Diplomats working on putting into effect the agreement reached in February among North Korea, the United States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea hope the transfer will at last revive stalled attempts to get the North to shut its nuclear facilities."

In a statement, the group said that “2007 is stacking up to be similar to and in some instances worse than 2000, a year which until now had the dubious distinction of being the peak year for air-travel delays.” Most airport improvement projects — for runways, terminals, gates and the like — are paid for by the so-called passenger facility charge added to the price of airline tickets. That charge has been capped by Congress at $4.50 since 2000, but the council said Congress should increase the cap."

Cutting those areas of pollution are the main indicators in China’s nationwide plan for a 10 percent reduction in pollution by 2010. Last year, China failed to meet its goal of two percent reductions in each category and instead registered small increases. But Mr. Zhang said improvements had become evident after government programs to install pollution technology on coal-fired power plants, as well as the installation of new wastewater treatment equipment. He acknowledged that other pollutants, including ammonia, continued to rise. And greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide are increasing rapidly."
