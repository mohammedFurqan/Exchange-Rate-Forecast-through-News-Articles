So why would this icon of Graham and Dodd investing, a man stingy with public utterance, who cares nothing for short-term performance, suddenly decide to establish a special link to Wall Street, cultivating a fraternity he has often disdained? And why did Mr. Buffett agree to give Alice D. Schroeder, an analyst little known outside insurance circles and employed by a primarily, ugh, retail brokerage house, unprecedented access to Berkshire -- access that culminated in her issuing a report on the company last week, marking the first time a major Wall Street firm has covered the Omaha conglomerate?
