Cortex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a start-up company focusing on products for treating brain diseases, tried that route at first, but found a better match with a company its own size.    This week Cortex, based in Irvine, Calif., announced a collaborative agreement with Alkermes Inc., a four-year-old company in Cambridge, Mass., that is developing technology to enable drugs to enter the brain more easily. The two companies will co-develop compounds that Cortex is now working on that are believed to counteract the destruction of nerve cells that accompanies strokes. Alkermes will also make a series of investments in Cortex, which could ultimately total as much as $26.5 million."

Mitigating Factors    Luck played a part in which group a company ended up in. It is not Macy's fault that the economy entered a prolonged period of weakness just as the company needed to improve cash flow. But there is also the matter of timing, and of the rising optimism through much of the 1980's.

Banks are much slower to reduce interest they charge on loans and much faster in cutting the interest they offer depositors.  'Grim Picture'    Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday: ""Unfortunately for the consumer, although bank yields are dropping like rocks, borrowing rates still remain stubbornly high. For example, the prime rate has come down two percentage points in the past four months, from 8.50 percent to 6.50 percent, and average certificate of deposit yields have fallen by more than one percentage point, to the 3 percent to 4 percent range.

Yet few managers provide emotional assistance to them because of misconceptions about corporate change and its effects.

The charges are not true. But they brought into sharp focus a serious problem that we do have: We don't use our workers as efficiently as those in other countries and, as a result, our businesses operate at a competitive disadvantage.   Neither quality nor efficiency -- the new benchmarks for success -- can be achieved without a well-educated, well-trained work force. The American education system is geared to producing college graduates but only 30 percent of jobs in this country require a college degree. The United States has not developed systems for producing world-class front-line workers. There will be more serious trouble ahead unless the business community, with help from government, builds a system to nurture and train the vast majority of young Americans who go into the workplace without college degrees so they can get better jobs with better pay."

This week Cortex, based in Irvine, Calif., announced a collaborative agreement with Alkermes Inc., a four-year-old company in Cambridge, Mass., that is developing technology to enable drugs to enter the brain more easily. The two companies will co-develop compounds that Cortex is now working on that are believed to counteract the destruction of nerve cells that accompanies strokes. Alkermes will also make a series of investments in Cortex, which could ultimately total as much as $26.5 million."

Government statistics, after all, show a mild recession and strong national economic fundamentals.   The problem is that many of those statistics are wildly misleading. We are in deeper trouble than we think. The dismal mood so evident in New Hampshire last week -- and which has surfaced elsewhere in the country -- is wholly justified. George Bush comes off looking like a doctor who prescribes placebos for a sick patient. Misleading Statistic No. 1: Unemployment   Unemployment soared to 10.8 percent in the 1982 recession, the worst showing since World War II. In this recession, the current peak is 7.1 percent. The current unemployment number looks relatively good because it mixes two factors -- jobs and the size of the labor force -- and neglects the fact that the labor force has contracted sharply."

Following are excerpts from their interviews and statements:   Dexter F. Baker    Chairman and chief executive, Air Products and Chemicals, an industrial-gas producer in Allentown, Pa., and one of the executives accompanying the President on the trip.   We didn't just go to Japan. The Pacific Basin is very important to America. It's our largest trading relationship, with two-way trade of about $300 billion. We are pretty close to balance or slightly positive with most of the countries. The economies in that part of the world, outside of Australia, are booming. It's a very strategically important part of the American economic scene.   Some market-opening initiatives were achieved. I think it was a very positive trip. This wasn't tokenism on the President's part. I think he performed magnificently. The key thing is that the President has created a really positive environment for American investment and trade to flow to Japan.   I'm convinced they genuinely want to improve the commercial relationships with the U.S. We talked about the tremendous opportunity to work together in dealing with markets opening up in Central and Eastern Europe. Now, American industry has got to get off its duff and start investing in those parts of the world. The President has done his job. The American business community now has to go to work to tranform that to the bottom line and jobs. Fred W. Lyons Jr.    President and chief executive, Marion Merrell Dow Inc., a pharmaceutical company in Kansas City, Mo.   We're a little different from the auto industry. We're very pleased with the relationship we have with the Japanese. We introduced our Seldane antihistamine over there a year and a half ago and we did $100 million of business in 1991.    We go through a similar process in terms of drug registration in any country and the same kinds of marketing challenges. The problems we deal with are not unique to Japan.    We are very strongly in favor of free trade. Wilfred J. Corrigan    Chairman and chief executive, LSI Logic Corporation, a semiconductor manufacturer in Milpitas, Calif:    I can see how they reached the conclusion that they should take predominantly the automobile guys, but I don't approve of it. Either the President should have gone on his own, or, if he was making it into a trade mission, I think there should have been more businesses represented.    The message that gives to Japan is ""Aha! What America is concerned about is automobiles."" As far as the Japanese are concerned the automobile battle is over. It's just a mopping-up operation. Their concern is more on the industries of the future. Electronics is going to be the manufacturing industry of the 21st century.    There should have been significant representation from the computer industry and the semiconductor industry, and I'm sure there's a dozen other strategic industries. The message to give is: ""We're really interested in the strategic-industry balance of trade."" George Hatsopoulos    Chairman and chief executive, Thermo Electron Corporation, a high-technology and industrial-products company in Waltham, Mass.    I think the trip was ill conceived. Looking at the trade deficit as a bilateral problem with Japan is inconsistent with a healthy world economy. They may need a surplus from us in cars if they buy oil from other countries that buy things from us.   We have an overall trade deficit, but the problem is primarily economic policy in the U.S. We do have problems with high-tech products, communications, and certain financial services in Japan. President Bush focused on the wrong industry. Focusing on autos is taking on Japan where they have a good story to tell.   I think the White House knows better. Outside of politics, the only justification for looking at things bilaterally is to put pressure on them to remove invisible barriers.  James S. Davis    Chairman and chief Executive, New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. of Boston.    Japan is our strongest trading partner so it was important for the President to go to maintain good political and personal relations. It's good for chief executives to get to know each other because we are so interdependent. Greater understanding comes from sitting down face to face. We just wanted to remind everybody with our ad thatyou can still compete effectively in foreign markets. I have got to feel that there were other people there who are doing reasonably well. We just didn't hear about it because it's not controversial. Don L. Gevirtz    Chairman and chief executive, the Foothill Group, a financial-services company in Agoura Hills, Calif.   As a Democrat, I think the handling of the Japan trip provides the first glimmer that someone like Bill Clinton could defeat Bush.   Bush is focusing on dying industries rather than focusing on newer entrepreneurial industries that are creating most of the new jobs and many of the new innovations. It was a disastrous trip to Japan in terms of where our emphasis should be.   The major problem we have is that industries like autos have become completely non-competitive and at the same time we have a banking industry that is illiquid and not able to provide credit to smaller companies that are still growing. Reginald Lewis    Chairman and chief executive, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., a food company based in New York.   I don't think it was the wrong thing to do. The trade imbalance with the Japanese can't be ignored. The auto industry wanted his help, and he can't be criticized for trying to give it. The American consumer is now more aware of the impact on the general economy of selecting a Japanese product over the American product. It might encourage them to examine whether there is a real difference rather than a perceived difference.   Some of the strident aspects of the dialogue might be unfortunate. The negatives probably couldn't be avoided because it was a media event. Some of these problems have been with us for a long time and defy easy solution. James Koontz    President and chief executive, Kingsbury Machine Tool Company of Keene, N.H., and chairman of the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences in Ann Arbor, Mich.   I think the trip created recognition that there is a problem. The fact that we focused on the Japanese trade problem may have gotten some of the Japanese transplants to realize that they have to work more with American vendors. Our company has been promised several orders in the near future.   On the other hand, our problems are not really with the Japanese. They are at home. The major companies and unions have to sit down and agree to make our plants more flexible and productive. The whole trip was a bit of an embarrassment. The Japanese are 90 percent right in saying our problems are here. Richard B. Madden    Chairman and chief executive, Potlatch Corporation, a forest-products company in San Francisco:    I believe he should have made the trip. The President and Prime Minister Miyazawa agreed the two nations would reach an agreement by the end of March that would substantially increase access to the Japanese paper market.    I don't know if this would have been achieved in anywhere near that time frame if the President hadn't made the trip. Potlatch is a major exporter of bleached paper board to Japan but we have been trying to break into the fine- coated paper market for some time and have had many difficulties. There are structural barriers."

But Fox's senior executives say the company will not be drastically affected.

In the last year alone, Fox Broadcasting grew by 25 percent and generated $40 million in profits."

H. Macy & Company filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy action, it was just the latest in the series of calamities to hit the nation's retailing industry. Two years of dismal sales and huge accumulations of debt, largely from the leveraged buyouts of the 1980's, have pushed some of the country's largest retailers to the brink. Since the beginning of 1990, Federated Department Stores, Allied Stores, Carter Hawley Hale, Ames and Hills have all filed for Chapter 11. More than 1,000 department-store outlets have been affected -- some closed, others with their staffs and inventories cut and all with the need to scramble.    Fortunately, the problems of the bankrupt chains are not those of the entire industry. Few retailers are as deeply in debt as Macy's and some of the largest chains have had strong sales even in the recession. Though final figures are not yet in -- retailing's fiscal year ends in March -- analysts expect 1991 to be a strong year for Wal-Mart, K-mart, the Gap, the Limited and Dillards.  Emphasis on Upsizing  One-Stop Concept Gets a New Spin    The list of who is doing well illustrates one of the most important lessons for retailers in the 1990's: Low-priced apparel is the seller. As a result, according to Kurt Bernard, president of Bernard's Retail Marketing Report, many department stores will be allocating more space for low-priced and what the industry calls ""bridge"" lines, secondary designer lines that sell for about 40 percent less than the primary apparel lines. The popularity of these lower-priced fashions is shown by the reported $150 million a year in sales of Donna Karan's D.K.N.Y. Bridge Line, Mr. Bernard said."

These new displays are inexpensive and relatively simple to manufacture, and unlike some current displays, they show up well in virtually all lighting conditions. They may eventually be used in everything from large-screen color televisions to auto mirrors to billboards. And they represent a challenge to the current market stranglehold held by the Japanese -- Sharp, Hitachi and Toshiba."

As a result of the Israeli Government decision, which was announced last week but has not yet been put into effect, Palestinian and other Arab delegations declined to come to Washington for the resumption on Tuesday of the American-brokered direct peace talks with Israel.

Lawlessness has overtaken parts of the north, where Kurdish brigands pilfer food stocks, steal vehicles at gunpoint and threaten those who challenge them.

Benefits consultants say some executives view the benefits as a ""gratuity"" rather than a permanent obligation, when they are not detailed in an employment contract. But most employers say they are committed to continuing the programs, albeit often with reduced benefits, despite rapid growth in both medical costs and the numbers of retirees.   Under an accounting rule that takes effect in 1993, corporations with at least 500 employees must calculate future retiree medical obligations and charge off the costs against income -- either all at once, or spread over 20 years. The rule does not require setting aside cash for the future costs."

Yet for Super Bowl XXVI, which CBS broadcast yesterday, no one was surprised that it took the network until Friday to sell the last of the 56 available 30-second spots.   The difference between then and now is a fundamental change in the ability of advertisers to plan ahead. As a result of two years of economic uncertainties, no company wants to make commitments as extravagant as a Super Bowl buy -- at $800,000 to $850,000 for each commercial -- as far as several months in advance. Across a broad range of product categories, like beer, cars, soft drinks, air travel and credit cards, rapidly changing market conditions make flexibility far more highly prized than having an annual media plan locked in by Jan. 1."

""is not winning and will never win."""

No other phrase seems to capture quite so perfectly the essence of Wall Street jargon.

Well, it looks as if Wall Street will get the last laugh. With yields at rock-bottom levels and with stocks soaring into regions that only an astronaut could love, some savvy investors are taking a fresh look at these obscure securities. The reason lies in the neat parlor trick they perform: in a soaring stock market, they act like a stock, but when stocks slump, they act like a bond."

So the computer giant is making it easier for its people to get fired. Under one of the most intricately structured appraisal systems in the nation, 10 percent of Big Blue's vaunted work force will get flunking grades in their annual reviews this year, marking for many the first step toward dismissal. Another 10 percent, deemed by their bosses to be superstars, could earn bonuses of $50,000 or more.    By contrast, Eastman Kodak's Eastman Chemical Company has stopped grading employees. To eliminate a tier of managers and push responsibility down the line, Eastman recently did away with the top jobs in marketing, production and product development. Now, decisions in manufacturing, for instance, and solutions to, say, waste treatment problems, are hammered out in monthly meetings by the heads of the company's three major plants. Because the new team structure makes it difficult to evaluate individual performance, Eastman Chemical is likely to adopt a system of peer review."

It left unresolved a broader question about the applicability of the rackeetering law, known as RICO, to securities fraud cases.

Since one of the main goals of recycling is to reduce the amount of trash, environmentalists say recycling standards should take account of paper products that have been used by consumers and thrown away. In the past, they say, many paper companies have been able to meet Government rules using only scraps from their own mills, a situation that has no effect on trash. Shifting Emphasis    Paper of all kinds is the biggest single component of municipal trash, and many municipalities, including New York, have looked to recycling to reduce the cost of trash disposal. When paper is recycled, it is broken down into its wood fibers, and then ink and other contaminants are removed and the fibers are re-formed into new paper products."

The new fund invested in the obscure and rarely traded bonds issued by Catholic institutions like colleges and hospitals. What could be more adorable?   But the predictable spate of stories didn't attract enough investors to keep body and soul together at Catholic Income. Its assets never totaled much more than $4.3 million, and fees ate up about 5.75 percent of each dollar investors chipped in. Last April, the Catholic Income Trust was quietly buried by Alpine and the estate was divided among its shareholders -- at $9 a share, a dollar less than its initial net asset value, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund service in Chicago."

When the P.B.G.C. realized CF&I's fund money was still flowing only one way -- out -- it decided to move in.   That is precisely how the P.B.G.C., which was created in 1974 by a provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, is meant to work: despite CF&I's problems, the pensions of 4,200 employees and retirees have been preserved."

But economists are now saying that this figure considerably underestimates the real number. They warn that the current unemployment figure, influential in gauging the nation's economic health and determining what policies should be adopted to improve it, provides a false sense of the economy's strength and its potential for rebounding.   The problem: changes in the work force over the last 15 years that are not accounted for in calculating the rate. One such change is the growing number of people on the edge of unemployment, counted as working but facing the hardships and insecurity of the jobless. These people, probably numbering more than three million, include many temporary and freelance workers, older men pushed into lower-paying jobs, consultants and single mothers who cannot work as many hours as they would like."

The change has energized the Big Three's studios, where designers still wince at the memory of a 1983 Fortune magazine cover showing four General Motors models, one indistinguishable from the next. That image sent home the point -- ""signed, sealed and delivered,"" as one designer put it: car styling, a traditional American strength, had become a weakness.   In recent years, even while battling the incursions of foreign car makers and retooling to meet ever-stricter Federal standards, they have kept a wistful eye on design. And in recent months, they have rolled out the fruits of their new visions, designed to distance themselves from the drab decades, to return to the days when the whole car -- not just the vanity plate -- made the statement of who you are. It's hardly a return to the be chromed land yachts of the 1950's, but it is a world of ""cab forward"" design, cat-eye headlights and even plastic cladding around the bottom, an upscale image borrowed from Europe that lends a racy line (as well as protecting the paint job from road debris)."

According to a text provided by South Korean officials, the agreement says that each side will be allowed to inspect ""objects"" on the other's territory ""in order to verify the de-nuclear ization of the Korean Peninsula."" But the procedures and methods for these inspections have yet to be decided by a joint nuclear control committee."

While the Administration and Senate leaders said that passage of the measure was essential to maintaining public faith in the system of Federal deposit insurance, individual senators were worried that support for the measure might lead voters to associate them with exorbitant costs and possible fraud in the rescue of hundreds of failing savings and loans across the nation."

With millions of households hit by unemployment, and the White House and Congress both worried about re-election, a lot of people inside and outside Washington say the Federal Reserve should not wait much longer. Since it usually takes around six months for the stimulative effects of interest rate cuts to show up in the economy, the stimulus of the Fed's aggressive December cut of the discount rate should be noticeable by June. But this downturn is not acting the way economists' models say recessions should behave. And that, some analysts say, is why the economy remains dead in the water some 18 months after the Fed began its long series of easings.  [ Page D1. ]"

But the sign, which cost the soft-drink company more than $3 million, is expected to be fully operational in a couple of weeks, the Coca-Cola Company said.   Since the sign was unveiled during a live television commercial on New Year's Eve, workers have been tinkering with its most unusual feature, a fiber-optics display inside a 42-foot-high bottle of Coke. When that feature works, a giant straw pops up and down as the fiber optics simulate a level of liquid inside the bottle that rises and falls, revealing the bottle's Coke-green color."

Jibril Aminu, who is also the oil minister of Nigeria, said he would ask OPEC's 12 members to reduce production by about 6 percent when they meet on Wednesday in Geneva."

The officials say they are likely to let the negotiations play themselves out until June or a little beyond, the time North Korea and South Korea set Saturday for the first inspections to establish that neither side is developing or deploying nuclear weapons."

The Nikkei index of 225 shares finished up 675.82 points, or 3.24 percent, to end the trading session at 21,534.12. The Nikkei lost 55.52 points on Tuesday."

This is not surprising given the fact that Israel is the central player in the negotiations. Since the Israelis control all the territorial cards in any land-for-peace barter, the current talks for the other players are really about how to get Israel to put one or more of those cards on the table."

His approval rating had plunged just below 20 percent, the lowest since his election in 1989.    Now, after leading the economy to its lowest rate of inflation in more than 20 years and managing to stay pretty much untainted by allegation of corruption against aides, Mr. Menem is riding a wave of support seldom seen in this country."

The 62-year-old president of the Sony Corporation talked for 15 minutes without once mentioning the Walkman, the video camcorder, or any of the other gadgetry that propelled his company to huge profitability and tremendous growth in the 1980's. He made only a cursory mention of his pet technological project, Sony's billion-dollar bet on high-definition television. What he did talk about were Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment -- once better known as Columbia Pictures and CBS Records."

Welch Jr., who earned the nickname Neutron Jack on his reputation for eliminating people while leaving buildings standing, has gone through a conversion and is now preaching corporate pacifism.    ""We cannot afford management styles that suppress and intimidate,"" he said in the company's new 1991 annual report. Instead, he called on his managers to adopt a set of ""soft concepts"" including such warm, fuzzy notions as having ""the self-confidence to empower others and behave in a boundaryless fashion."""

Mr. Major, who became Prime Minister in November 1990 after a Tory rebellion against Margaret Thatcher's leadership, will battle for a mandate of his own in the middle of the longest British recession since the 1930's.

An essential obstacle lay in the struggle over control of the republic's crude oil. Another was the absence of some important people who were supposed to be there. Yet another was the lack of stable policies to govern foreign investments in oil, which Russian officials acknowledged might be difficult to achieve."

No more diesel fumes, just a benign trace or two from the natural-gas generator that runs the air conditioner and heater.   This ahead-of-the-curve idea is outlined in a private placement memorandum now making the rounds among the very wealthy set out West. (The minimum outlay is $25,000, so none but the wealthy need apply.) By privately selling $2 million worth of preferred and common shares, CleanAir Transit hopes to grow enough to sell more shares to the general public in a year or so."

But after a conversation a few weeks back with a patient who happens to be a mortgage broker, she started considering the windfall she would reap from refinancing her mortgage at a time when rates are the lowest they have been since the 1970's.   ""My patient turned me on to it,"" Ms. Doherty said. ""I want to get some work done on the house, and I thought, if I can refinance to get a lower rate and use the money to get this work done, it would be great.""   Over the last month, millions of homeowners across the country have experienced a similar epiphany. Suddenly, talk of refinancings, points and appraisals is everywhere, from offices to cocktail parties to supermarket checkout lines. Busy Time for Lenders    The talk has been accompanied by a record wave of mortgage refinancings, as homeowners seek to trade their higher mortgage rates for loan rates near 8 1/2 percent, saving hundreds or thousands of dollars a month.    Nationally, according to a Mortgage Bankers Association of America survey of 20 large mortgage bankers, the number of refinancing applications has risen fivefold since a year ago and twelvefold since March 1990. About 1.5 million households saved $3 billion in 1991 by refinancing mortgages. About three million are expected to refinance this year and save $6 billion.   Since interest rates hit an 18-year low in early January, banks, savings and loans, mortgage banks and other lenders have been swamped with refinancing applications. And as rates edged up in the last several weeks, the deluge accelerated, with homeowners rushing to lock in rates before they go higher.    ""Right now the interest rates are so low, I don't think we're going to see this again for quite some time,"" said Mark Heydt, who is trying to refinance a mortgage on his second home in Amagansett, N.Y.   Lenders say they cannot answer all their telephone calls, much less process all the requests that are piling up, even though many are working 12-hour days and hiring temporary and permanent workers. Many frustrated homeowners can confirm the delays.   ""People are getting really frustrated,"" said Michael Petree, the chief financial officer of the Finance West Corporation, a mortgage broker in Los Angeles. ""By the time they've read the news and decided to get off the fence, they can get their application started if they are lucky enough to get through to a loan officer at all. Then the document requirements are very strict, and you've got to wait three to four weeks for an appraisal, and you've got to pay for that.""   Other customers are hearing from their lenders -- but hearing bad news: tighter lending regulations make it difficult or impossible for them to qualify, or the declining value of their home requires them to put up more cash as equity if they want a loan at a lower rate.   Interest rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell during much of last year, and dipped in December to their recent lows of a bit above 8 percent after the Federal Reserve acted aggressively to push down rates to try to stimulate the economy. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported Friday that the average rate nationwide on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.68 percent, up from 8.56 percent in the previous week's survey. Yet even if rates are not quite the bargain they were a few weeks ago, they are still very enticing to homeowners paying mortgage interest of 10 percent or more.   ""Activity seems to have hit its peak right about now, and it may go even higher in the next several weeks as more consumers notice that rates are moving up, and they act to get in before rates go even higher,"" said Richard W. Peach, the deputy chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. Substantial Sums at Stake    The refinancing activity generates considerable income for lenders in the short run, but reduces their interest income in the long run and potentially leaves lenders with large portfolios of fixed-rate loans that could turn unprofitable if interest rates move sharply higher and stay there. For homeowners who can lock in rates significantly below their current mortgages, refinancing can be a substantial windfall, even after the advance payments involved.   Mr. Peach said that last year the combination of refinancings and the reductions in the rates used to determine the monthly payments of homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages saved homeowners $10 billion to $15 billion. This year, that combination of factors will yield an additional $12 billion to $18 billion in savings, an amount that could be a powerful stimulus to consumer spending or to savings.   Tony Podesta, a lobbyist who lives in Washington, bought his home in the Woodley Park section in 1987 and has a $475,000 first mortgage at 10.625 percent and a $125,000 second mortgage at 10.5 percent. By refinancing , he said, he should be able to wrap the two mortgages together and end up paying just under $5,000 a month, about the same that he is paying now on his first mortgage alone. His savings: as much as $2,000 a month.    ""I don't know what economic conditions will be in the coming year, and reducing my outflow by a couple of thousand dollars a month takes a weight off my heart,"" Mr. Podesta said. ""But I'm not planning to renovate my house or buy a new car or a washing machine. My basic mood is that this may be a good time to save or invest rather than go out and consume."" Getting Extra Money    Lynne Pampel of Kingston, N.Y., said she was paying 11.3 percent on her $69,000 mortgage but hoped to refinance at about 8.8 percent, saving $148 a month.   ""The money I'm saving will help me live better and in a more comfortable style,"" said Ms. Pampel, a teacher and single parent of two children. ""Right now I'm living in a hand-to-mouth situation. I have to watch every penny I spend. This will help me out a lot.""   John Barrett of Rye Brook, N.Y., said he was refinancing his 10 percent mortgage at 8.25 percent, saving $70,000 over 30 years. He plans to put the money he saves into a tax-free mutual fund for his 7-month-old son, Christopher.   Mr. Heydt took out a $200,000 mortgage two years ago at 10.5 percent. Now he hopes to refinance at 8.75 percent, saving as much as $300 a month over the next 15 years. But five weeks after submitting his application, Mr. Heydt is still waiting for his house to be appraised.   The surge in refinancing has been a welcome reversal for many in the real estate business. Roger J. Park, an appraiser in Corona, Calif., said his business is up 30 percent since October, with 80 percent of the increase accounted for by refinancings.   ""It has been ridiculously busy,"" Mr. Park said. ""There are days when I feel like I'm the only appraiser in the world.""   Lenders report that most borrowers who are refinancing want fixed-rate mortgages, although some are tempted by extremely low initial rates on adjustable loans. The average rate on mortgages with rates that are adjusted once a year has been about 6 percent recently, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.    Of course, borrowers also have to take into account the fees and other costs of refinancing, which typically total 2 percent of the loan amount or more. Many lenders also charge ""points,"" which is interest paid in advance. The points can be as much as 4 percent of the amount borrowed.   ""There's a belief out there that the rate is 8 percent with no points, and the reality is higher than that,"" said Lynn Luce, manager of the Federal Way, Wash., branch office of Countrywide Credit, a mortgage broker. ""People are shocked that rates are up so much. By the time we figure out what their interest rate and payment actually is, about 50 percent of the people fall out.""    For many people the process of refinancing is one of waiting as patiently as possible and hoping for the best. Dr. Gary Salenger, the dentist Ms. Doherty works for, is pursuing a refinancing of his own. He has a 15-year mortgage with a balance of $220,000 and an interest rate of 9.75 percent. He wants to refinance $300,000 at 15 years, using the additional $80,000 to remodel his kitchen and pay off a car loan.   Dr. Salenger spoke to his banker in December and was quoted a rate of 8.6 percent but has not heard from the bank since. His home in Malibu, Calif., was appraised three weeks ago -- but he has not heard from the appraiser.   ""I haven't done anything about it because we're not really ready to do the kitchen yet,"" Dr. Salenger said. ""I'm assuming rates will stay fairly low for quite a while. If they started to go up a lot I probably wouldn't do it. I assume that if they went over 9 percent it probably wouldn't make sense anymore."" DECIDING WHEN TO REFINANCE    When is it worthwhile to refinance? In the past, when homes were generally increasing in value, the test was the ""2-2-2"" formula. If borrowers had been in their home at least two years, intended to stay at least two more and refinanced at a rate at least two points lower than their current mortgage rate, refinancing made sense.   That can still be a starting point, but lenders and financial planners say homeowners should calculate how much they will pay in closing costs, fees and points (a point, 1 percent of the amount borrowed, is interest paid in advance).    Then they should calculate how much their monthly mortgage payments will drop after refinancing at a lower rate, and how long it will take before their monthly savings cover the refinancing costs. Any bank can provide this information. If a homeowner plans to stay in a home no more than five years and expects it to take three years to recoup the refinancing costs, refinancing might not make financial sense.   Homeowners should also shop carefully and in comparing mortgages should pay particular attention not to the first-year interest rate but to the A.P.R., or annual percentage rate. The A.P.R. includes the points paid in advance.   Many newspapers print tables in their weekly real estate sections showing mortgages available from local lenders. HSH Associates, (800) 873-2837, a consulting firm in Butler, N.J., surveys 2,000 lenders around the country and publishes the results."

The problem, he continued, is that guitars have flat fingerboards instead of an arched one like a violin. As a result, a musician has a choice between running the bow over all strings at once or the high string and low string individually. It is impossible to hit individual strings in the middle."
