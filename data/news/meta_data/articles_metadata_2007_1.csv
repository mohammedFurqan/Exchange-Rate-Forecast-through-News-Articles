John Craddock of the United States Army, who recently took over as the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe, said Russia had nothing to fear from a planned antimissile system that the United States wants to install in Poland and the Czech Republic. “It’s been clearly stated what the U.S. intention is,” he said, “and that is to provide defense against missiles from a rogue nation.” Although he did not name any country, the antimissile site would be designed to stop attacks by Iran against the United States and its European allies. Last weekend, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia reacted angrily to the plan to install a missile defense system in former Soviet Bloc countries, saying it would set off a new arms race. On Thursday, Gen. Yuri N. Baluyevsky, the chief of the Russian military’s general staff, said that if the United States went through with the system, Russia might drop out of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty of 1987, in which the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to eliminate land-based ballistic and cruise nuclear missiles with a range of 310 to 3,410 miles."

Most of the passengers will be Airbus and Lufthansa employees, though some reporters and photographers will also be aboard. Lufthansa has ordered 15 A380s and expects its first delivery in summer 2009. Meanwhile, another Airbus A380  this one without passengers and operated by a crew from the Australian airline Qantas  is expected to arrive on the same day and at about the same time at Los Angeles International Airport, according to a joint statement by Airbus, the airport, the Los Angeles mayor’s office and Qantas. That flight will depart from Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, where the A380 program has had unexpected manufacturing delays. Los Angeles International has long lagged in making the extensive renovations to terminal gates and taxiways to accommodate the double-decker airliner, and is still some time away from doing so. The A380 will park on a ramp at Los Angeles for publicity and ground-based tests. Airbus and some airlines with A380 orders have criticized Los Angeles International for falling behind on the renovations. The airport, which is competing with San Francisco as a major Pacific overseas gateway, recently began a $723.5 million modernization of its international terminal that will include at least two gates that can accommodate the A380. Qantas has ordered 20 A380s and expects its first delivery in summer 2008."

Unisys plans to open its first Registered Traveler program kiosk at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport in mid-February. But it is unlikely that the program will initially offer shoe-scanning technology, said Larry Zmuda, the company’s partner for homeland-security-related business. In an interview, Mr. Zmuda said the major concern for Unisys was ensuring the program’s “predictability” for members, who will undergo a federal background check and pay an annual fee to receive biometrically encoded I.D. cards and access to a special lane for expedited passage through the security checkpoint. Mr. Zmuda cited early snags with shoe-scanning technology being tested in Orlando by Verified Identity Pass, which already operates a Registered Traveler program called Clear at Orlando and four other airports. The Clear shoe-scanning technology, developed by General Electric Security, was intended to detect traces of explosives and suspicious metal, and to allow most travelers to pass through Clear lanes without having to remove their shoes. But the scanner rejected an unexpectedly high number of travelers’ shoes in Orlando, requiring members to remove their shoes just as they would at regular checkpoints. Mr. Zmuda said Unisys, which plans to be operating in 6 to 10 airports within a year, will probably offer only a special lane for the I.D. cards in Reno while the company continues to study options that will provide more benefits. Steven Brill, the founder of Verified Identity, has said that not having to remove shoes is the biggest potential benefit sought by customers. But Mr. Zmuda said that “all of our survey data” show that not having to remove laptops from cases is the biggest benefit sought by potential members."

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his New Year’s message that the pace of expansion may ease in 2007 because of an economic slowdown in the United States and weaker global demand for electronics, which account for about half the $118 billion economy’s exports.

Output dropped 13.1 percent last year. Mr. Reyes Heróles, a former energy minister who took over at Pemex in December, said other projects would help make up for the shortfall at Cantarell, which last year accounted for about 55 percent of Pemex’s overall production of 3.26 million barrels a day. Mexico is a top supplier of imported oil to the United States. Mr. Reyes Heróles said that the company needed additional investment of $8 billion to $10 billion a year to keep up production, develop new reserves, expand its refining capacity and modernize its storage and transport network. But Pemex is closed to private investment and cannot finance the investment itself. Last year, Pemex sales surpassed $100 billion but it paid $79 billion in taxes, which accounted for almost 40 percent of Mexico’s federal budget."

One case of H5N1 flu, the country’s 75th, was confirmed by the Health Ministry over the weekend; it was in a 14-year-old boy who had reportedly buried a flock of backyard ducks that died suddenly. He was alive but using a respirator to breathe. A local radio station and news outlets said six other people from the same town  at least three of them related to him  were hospitalized with flu symptoms in Jakarta, being treated with Tamiflu and awaiting test results. Indonesia has failed to get its poultry epidemic under control since it emerged in 2005."

He stabbed it in the stomach, forcing it to flee. “Thank goodness the knife was still new, so it was sharp enough,” said Mr. Sithole, who was treated for injuries to his right leg and hands, according to the South African Press Association."
