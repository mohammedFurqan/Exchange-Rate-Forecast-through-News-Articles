An odd revelation, you say? Well, it's only a small leap to Liggett's admission that smoking is addictive and causes cancer -- long accepted by most people as scientific fact. In the Great Tobacco Wars, though, a lot comes down to what you admit, and this is the first such concession by a tobacco company. Why did Liggett break ranks? Basically, it's a company in trouble -- its sales are infinitesimal compared with Philip Morris's -- and those state lawsuits could have been fatal. And by promising to pay 25 percent of its profits to 22 states, it could be promising 25 percent of nothing; Liggett is in the red already, and when it adds warning labels about addictiveness and cancer -- that's part of the deal -- it could sell even fewer cigarettes. Some tobacco foes had high hopes that documents promised by Liggett would help in the larger battle. ''We will break the back of this conspiracy of lies and deceit,'' one said. But the next battle will be over whether those documents really emerge.     UTILITY RATES  A Gift for Long Island  There's a certain odd pleasure in being at the bottom of any particular barrel, a strange pride in getting the shortest of all sticks. But Long Islanders, alas, will soon lose one complaining right: that they have the nation's highest power bills. They will, that is, if Gov. George E. Pataki's deal for a partial state takeover of Lilco becomes reality. The problem, of course, has been the billions spent on the disastrous Shoreham plant, but Mr. Pataki's solution, as Lilco heads toward a merger with Brooklyn Union Gas, is to have the state issue bonds and take over the Shoreham debt. Skeptics derided it as a political gift to consumers, but it's such a resoundingly popular idea that most politicians fell all over one another to get on board.     ANNUAL REPORTS  Puzzled? Just Click  Face it. Few people consider annual reports bedtime reading. What you get, basically, is a bunch of feel-good pictures telling you how warm and wonderful the company is (even if it has just been caught poisoning people or is on the verge of bankruptcy), followed by page upon page of numbers indecipherable to anyone lacking an advanced accounting degree. I.B.M. is out to change that, and it just posted its snazzy new on-line annual report (www.ibm.com/AnnualReport/1996). For the financially savvy, it offers all sorts of goodies you can't get in the paper copy: you can, say, click on two or more categories together, like hardware and software sales, and combine them in a single chart. But I.B.M. also says it has made the report accessible to all. You don't know what ''revenues'' means? Keep clicking, and you'll wend your way to a fourth-grader's definition. Here's another I.B.M. number out last week: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman and chief executive, made $20.2 million last year, up 30 percent from 1995. Strangely, though, all the clicking in the world won't turn that up on the Web site.    AUTO SAFETY  Car Meets Truck; Car Loses  They're everywhere. Explorers, Grand Cherokees, monster Suburbans -- all engaged in the death-defying task of moving kids and groceries. Some drivers, of course, watch all this with mounting amusement -- they'd never be caught dead in these hulking gas-guzzlers. They'd better stop laughing; when it comes to safety, no car is remotely an island. Look at it this way: your sedan weighs a ton and a half; that leather-lined, CD-equipped tank coming at you weighs two tons. Your bumper is 16 inches off the ground; the other one is 21. Who gets hurt? You do. Only a third of vehicles on the road are light trucks, but more Americans die when car meets light truck than when car meets car. In crashes involving cars and light trucks, 80 percent of those killed are in cars. What to do? Make cars heavier? Make light trucks lighter? Ban cars? Ban light trucks? No, far simpler: just create extra lanes. One for cars, one for car pools, one for light trucks -- littered, of course, with boulders and tree stumps to climb over, to make the drivers feel powerful.    AIR BAGS  One Size Saves Some  On another auto safety issue, an odd debate is raging. In hearings in Washington last week, one safety official said air bags kill children because ''the dose is too big.'' If you make them less potent and save some children, though, you lose some adults -- a grisly calculus. An added twist: the less-potent air bags might save people who are wearing seat belts but not those who aren't. So assuming that all these tradeoffs have been calculated correctly -- and assuming that another solution is not at hand -- it comes down to a choice between saving children or saving adults without the sense to buckle up. That one's easy.    CELL PHONES  Digital Privacy? Not Quite  If only Newt Gingrich had had one of those new digital cellular phones, everyone said, he'd never have gotten into trouble talking ethics in a technological fishbowl. That was one of digital's big selling points -- safety from eavesdroppers. Last week, though, some security pros said it was pretty simple to crack into digital calls after all. Never mind.    PLASTIC UNLIMITED  Have Credit, Will Spend  Did credit-card companies think Americans wouldn't use all that plastic? Fat chance. They bombarded people with card offers -- a staggering eight billion or so in three years -- and now, naturally enough, Americans are charging things like crazy. And, increasingly, not paying their bills. A recent report showed that 3.72 percent of card holders were behind on their payments late last year, up from 3.34 percent a year earlier. Last week, in fact, one fast-growing card issuer, Advanta, said it would lose money this quarter because 7.5 percent of its loans had gone bad. The solution, as many card companies see it, is to tighten lending standards, but if that crimps spending, it could hurt the economy, making credit delinquencies even more likely. The good news, though: you might not get so many credit-card solicitations in the mail.    AN ENERGY ANSWER  It's Blowing in the Wind  Are solar and wind power the stuff of fuzzy-headed visionaries? That's been the conventional wisdom. They'll always be fanciful drops in the bucket, critics say; they can never compete. Last week, though, the idea looked downright mainstream. Enron, the Houston energy giant, said it's building the world's largest wind-power project -- a huge endeavor involving 150 turbines in Iowa, each 15 stories high, with 25-ton rotors. Competitive? Absolutely. They'll provide power for 50,000 homes at an efficient 4 to 4.5 cents a kilowatt-hour. And when the multiple-choice new utility world arrives, allowing people to pick their power, some environmentally conscious types might just go for renewable sources even if does cost a bit more.

The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose 4.3 points, to 113.8. The Commerce Department said home sales surged 14.2 percent. $(62.$)    Concern over the possibility of an overly robust economy, as well as end-of-the-year selling by investors, caused stocks to plunge.

At left at the head of the table was Michael Cavanaugh, assistant manager of the regional board of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, not Rene Boisvert, the former top executive of the Biddeford mill. Next to Mr. Cavanaugh was Wally Szumita, business agent for Local 1856 of the union.    The article also misstated the party affiliation of the Mayor of Biddeford, James M. Grattelo.

In a second report, the Conference Board said that its Index of Leading Indicators climbed three-tenths of 1 percent in January, its biggest advance since May. $(Page D4.$)    The economic reports raised fears of inflation in the bond market. The yield on the 30-year bond climbed to 6.86 percent from 6.83. $(D17.$)    A strong dollar kept Treasury prices from falling further. In a broad rally, the dollar touched a three-year high of 1.7152 German marks before settling at 1.7146. $(D21.$)    Fed Chief Defends Words on Stocks  Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, denied that he intended to talk the markets down by warning last week that investors might be unduly optimistic. He was responding to questions about his comments on stock valuations by a Republican member of the House Budget Committee. $(D10.$)    Mr. Greenspan urged the House Banking Committee to appoint a commission to provide a better estimate of increases in the cost of living than the Consumer Price Index, which most economists believe overstates inflation. The Clinton Administration and Congress have been dancing around the issue of whether to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security payments. $(A17.$)    Job Cuts at Renault  A plan for job cuts at Renault of France -- of which Belgium will bear the brunt -- shows how the European push toward unity, with its demands for fiscal discipline and greater competitiveness, and the tradition of the social safety net can collide. $(D4.$)    Ford, Too, Says Sales Are Down  Ford Motor said that its domestic vehicle sales fell 3.2 percent in February from a record pace a year earlier, rounding out a down month for the Big Three auto makers. $(D22.$)    Two Retailers Report Earnings  Two retailers, Dayton Hudson and Federated Department Stores, reported higher operating earnings, though Dayton Hudson said its earnings fell after special charges. $(D4.$)    Earnings Calculations to Change  The Financial Accounting Standards Board has voted to change the way earnings per share will be calculated, making it more important to pay attention to the diluted number, the second one in most reports. $(D5.$)    Offer for Barney's Is Rejected  As expected, the creditors committee of Barney's has rejected a $240 million bid for the retailer from Dickson Concepts. $(D4.$)    2 Views on Big Steel  Analysts generally like the stocks of scrap recyclers who provide the raw material for steel minimills, as well as those of service companies that turn steel into parts for the eventual user. But on old-line manufacturers like USX, Wall Street cannot seem to reach a consensus. Market Place. $(D10.$)    Watch Out for Paper Cuts!  Because most product liability cases filed these days include an allegation that a manufacturer failed to warn of potential dangers, companies have reacted -- many experts say overreacted -- by pasting warnings on every imaginable product. $(A1.$)    Pass Go and Collect Cheap Burgers  McDonald's no longer has anything like a monopoly on the fast-food market.

For the year, the core inflation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, was up only 2.6 percent. Along with an increase of the same size in 1994, that was the lowest core inflation since 1965. Over all, prices were up 3.3 percent in 1996.    And the Government's survey of retail sales confirmed what merchants had suggested for weeks: The holiday season produced gains, but they were smaller than retailers had hoped. Sales climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in December, to a level 4.4 percent above that of December 1995. $(Page D2.$)    Broad Rally in Stocks  The moderate inflation seen in the consumer price report encouraged buying in the stock and bond markets. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 53.11 points, to 6,762.29, its sixth record close in two weeks. Broader indexes also surged. $(D8.$)    Bond prices revived after a two-day slump.

Rubin, taking a little air out of the rapidly rising dollar, suggested that the Administration has ended its two-year-long effort to drive up the dollar against the world's other major currencies. Mr. Rubin has said repeatedly over that time that ''a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States.'' Yesterday, in a subtly worded change of policy, he said that while a strong dollar was still in America's interest, ''we have had a strong dollar for some time now,'' a phrase he used three more times.     The comments by Mr. Rubin set off a torrent of activity on world financial markets and knocked the dollar down just before it hit 125 yen, a four-year high. For the day, the dollar settled in New York at 122.60 yen, down 0.94 yen from Thursday. Against the mark, the dollar ended at 1.6568, up a slight 0.0064 from the day before. $(Page 1.$)    TCI Names New President  The board of Tele-Communications Inc. appointed Leo J. Hindery Jr. president. That title was previously held by John C. Malone, who remains chairman and chief executive. In recent years, Mr. Malone had withdrawn from daily management, leaving that responsibility with Brendon Clouston, president of the company's giant cable operations. The move was seen by analysts as part of an effort to bolster the shares of Tele-Communications, which have lagged badly in a bull market, as have those of other cable companies. In December, as part of that effort, Mr. Malone announced that the company would begin a sweeping program to cut costs, reduce debt and improve net income. $(36.$)    N.A.S.D.

The session showed once again how jittery the market can be in reaction to a news headline. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 82.74 points, or 1.22 percent, to close at 6,855.80, just 28 points shy of the closing high it set on Jan. 21. For the week, the Dow was up 42.71 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent. Broader market indexes fared even better. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.41 points, to 789.56, a new high. And the Nasdaq composite index was up 11.31 points, to 1,357.71, after technology issues rebounded from a weeklong decline. $(38.$)    Bonds Rise on Jobs Report  Investors who have kept to the sidelines of the bond market this week returned en masse after the Labor Department released employment figures that indicated that growth in wages was slow. The 30-year Treasury bond gained 20/32 , to a price of 97 12/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.70 percent, from 6.75 percent on Thursday. For investors, the gain was about $6 for each bond with a face value of $1,000. $(38.$)     German Phone Alliance Ends   Cable and Wireless pulled out of its German telecommunications alliance with Veba and received 2.21 billion marks, or $1.3 billion, for its share in the venture, leaving Veba and RWE, the group's other member, to seek ''a new international partner.'' The new Cable and Wireless strategy is to concentrate on the British and Continental markets, while Veba plans to focus on Germany. $(36.$)    Energy Prices Fall on Mild Weather   Energy prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dragged down by growing expectations that a mild winter in the Northeast would keep inventories of heating fuels high. Energy prices fell after the National Weather Service forecast that mid-February temperatures would continue to be above normal in the Northeast, the biggest market for heating oil. On other markets, coffee prices rose and copper fell. $(34.$)     Family Member Quits Dow Jones Job   An outspoken member of the family that controls Dow Jones & Company has quit his job there.
