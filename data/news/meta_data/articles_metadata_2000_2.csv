The decision by the National Constitutional Assembly came after thugs attacked its peaceful march over the weekend, injuring several people. The group, which blamed the police for failing to prevent the violence, has criticized official corruption, the unraveling economy and Mr. Mugabe's support of black squatters on white-owned farms.    Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)    AFRICANS AND EUROPEANS MEET  African leaders pleaded in Cairo for sweeping relief of their continent's crippling debt at the start of the first Africa-Europe summit meeting. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, left, opened the talks between the 15-nation European Union and the 52-nation Organization of African Unity with a call for a radical solution to the debt problem. Despite economic reform and efforts to spread democracy and human rights, he said, Western aid had slumped in the last two decades and Africa's share of trade had shrunk.    (Reuters)    SOUTH AFRICA: UNIONS' GLOBAL VIEW  The world labor union movement said it would muster all its strength to fight the social and economic fallout of globalization, which it said was widening the gap between rich and poor nations. Labor leaders addressing the start in Durban of the 17th World Congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions said globalization needed to pay attention to social rights for it to be a sustainable economic system.    (Reuters)    MIDDLE EAST    IRAQ: TURKS STRIKE AT KURDS  Turkish F-16 jets struck Kurdish rebel bases in northern Iraq, as more than 1,000 troops penetrated some six miles into the region in a new campaign to hunt down the guerrillas, a military official said. Cobra helicopter gunships were reported reinforcing the troops and armored units. No serious clashes with the guerrillas were reported.    (AP)    ASIA    INDONESIA: SUHARTO QUIZZED  A five-member team from the attorney general's office questioned former President Suharto at his home about corruption during his 32-year rule. The session ended after 90 minutes when Mr. Suharto said he was tired. He has defied summonses to appear at the attorney general's office for questioning, saying he is too ill.   Seth Mydans (NYT)    LAOS: BLAST TIED TO TERRORISTS  Authorities blamed unspecified terrorists for an explosion at the Thank You Very Much Restaurant in the capital, Vientiane, that it said wounded six Western tourists and two Laotians. Such acts are rare in the capital but bandits and the remnants of anti-Communist Hmong insurgents do operate in the countryside.    Seth Mydans (NYT)    AFGHANISTAN: CURRENCY WEAKENED  Reported drought damage to opium crops has further battered Afghanistan's weak currency and driven money changers in Kabul to try to dump the local currency in favor of hard currencies. A bumper harvest last year established Afghanistan as the world's leading source of opium, the United Nations estimates. Afghanistan relies on opium, the raw ingredient for heroin, as its primary export.    Christopher S. Wren (NYT)    THE AMERICAS    MEXICO: VOTE SPLITS PARTY  A primary in the race for governor of Tabasco State has revived bitter divisions in the governing party, known as the PRI, with complaints that the departing governor, Roberto Madrazo, rigged the vote to favor a longtime aide, Manuel Andrade, over Congressman Arturo Nunez, who has spent years as a senior official in the government and the PRI. Partial results showed Mr. Andrade with 57 percent of the vote and Mr. Nunez with 38 percent. In the presidential primary last year Mr. Madrazo challenged the PRI establishment, losing to Francisco Labastida.    (AP)    EUROPE    SWITZERLAND: HOLOCAUST TRIAL  A Swiss man who denies that Hitler's gas chambers existed has gone on trial on charges that he violated Switzerland's anti-racism law. Gaston-Armand Amaudruz, 79, is being tried in Lausanne for writing that there is no evidence of the Holocaust's gas chambers. A 1995 Swiss law makes it illegal to deny or justify genocide. Mr. Amaudruz, a spokesman for a far-right group, faces up to three years in jail and a $25,000 fine.    Elizabeth Olson (NYT)    IRELAND: EX-PREMIER PAYING BACK TAXES  Former  Prime Minister Charlie Haughey, 74, will sell off family properties to pay more than $1.2 million in back taxes, including interest, on gifts received while in office from a supermarket executive. Mr. Haughey's fall from grace reached a low last year when he was booed by spectators at the funeral of a previous Fianna Fail party leader. He is also facing charges of obstructing a 1997 tribunal looking into payments to politicians.    Brian Lavery (NYT)    GERMANY: RIGHTIST DATA  The number of neo-Nazi and right-wing extremists declined from about 54,000 in 1998 to around 51,000 in 1999, the Federal Agency for the Protection of the Constitution said in an official report. The number of rightists deemed likely to commit acts of violence, however, grew by about 10 percent to 9,000, the agency said, adding that recorded violent attacks by far rightists reached 746, up from 708 in 1998. Germany's seven million foreigners are considered particular targets of those attacks.    Victor Homola (NYT)    GERMANY: SPYING ON KOHL  The former head of East Germany's foreign espionage service, Markus Wolf, said in an interview with Reuters that his agents had known for a long time about the illegal slush fund set up by the Christian Democrats under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
