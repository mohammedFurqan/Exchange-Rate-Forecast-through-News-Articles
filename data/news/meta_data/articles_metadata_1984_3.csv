Utilities in New York or New England would pay $80,000 or more an hour for that amount of power on a hot summer afternoon.     But Hydro-Quebec, the provincial utility, with nine turbines producing 3,300 megawatts of electricity here today at its giant new complex, had no use for the electricity and no way to export it.   That will change in the next few years, however, when the generating stations being completed here, at the edge of the Canadian tundra, are linked by new transmission lines to New England and New York.   At that point the relative abundance of electricity in the northeastern portion of the continent should bring lower prices. This abundance will largely result from the output of the La Grande project, rising out of a vast area of taiga, the terrain of caribou moss, scrawny black spruce and jack pines."

The thinking was rooted in recent history.  Throughout the years of guerrilla campaigns that finally ended white minority rule in the country once called Rhodesia, there were two distinct national armies in the field, divided from each other by tribe and personality. One fought under Mr. Mugabe's banner, the other was loyal to his archrival, Joshua Nkomo. Both were committed to an independent Zimbabwe under their own leaders.    Four years later, despite close calls and with the help of good fortune not always of his own making, Mr. Mugabe boasts that the war some saw as inevitable has not taken place."

Liberals - as well as members of the New Democratic Party, which fared unexpectedly well - would debate that. But the returns clearly marked a setback for Pierre Elliott Trudeau's Liberal Party, which has run Canada for most of this century. Even more, however, it reflected dissatisfaction with Canada's stagnant economy and lack of a sense of direction."

Prices continue to rise, of course, but at lower rates than the country has seen since the 1960's.   Some experts say the United States may have entered a long-lived period of disinflation in which a broad range of prices would increase at a rate significantly slower than in the past.    Economists attribute this slowing of inflation partly to the determination of the Federal Reserve to discourage rising prices - by restraining growth of the money supply, starving demand for credit and letting interest rates soar - even at the cost of the long 1981-82 recession.   Convergence of Forces    Economists also cite the fortuitous anti-inflationary convergence of several other forces: the surprising strength of the dollar, softening prices for vital raw materials such as oil, food and other commodities, a low level of wage increases, and deregulation of such industries as airlines and telecommunications."

Its price performance has hardly been   spectacular lately and there are still   plenty of people who consider it nothing but a barbaric relic of the dark past.

Suddenly, old and forgotten mining operations are reopening in such unlikely gold towns as Walnut Creek, Va., within commuting distance of Washington, and Ishpeming in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Hundreds of prospectors, usually employees of small mining companies, are searching for new veins of gold in the West, and sometimes finding them, as the Pinson Mining Company did in the mountainous desert country near this old gold town. In fact, new strikes are making Nevada's northern desert and California's wine-making Napa Valley busy centers of gold production."

The F.C.C. sets a profit margin on the regulated operations of A.T.&T. The new system would also apply to the seven regional telephone companies created in the Jan. 1 breakup of A.T.& T.    A.T.& T. said it was confident that any review of its profit margin would lead to an increase.   If adopted, such a system could possibly lead to more frequent changes in long-distance telephone rates. In recent years, the F.C.C. has reviewed A.T.& T.'s profit margin an average of only once every five years after conducting a detailed investigation."

''A lot of people spent the day in meetings,'' said one government securities dealer, ''but the real cause of the inactivity is the lack of conviction about future rate changes.''    The lack of conviction stems from the ambiguous nature of recent economic data, which show that economic growth is slowing, but not necessarily enough to bring about lower interest rates.    ''It would be a mistake to assume that overall business credit demands are on the wane'' just because the economy is less robust than earlier in the year, said Abraham Gulkowitz, vice president at the Bankers Trust Company. In the latest issue of Prospects for the Credit Markets, Mr. Gulkowitz said business credit demands should continue to expand, particularly in the commercial paper market, while consumers are still in good financial condition. ''All in all,'' he said, ''business, consumers and government should continue to keep upward pressure on interest rates through the remainder of the year.''"

Likud political strategists are understood to have decided that the best way to prevent a large number of their supporters from defecting to Labor at this late stage in the campaign is to appeal to the idea of a national unity government that would bring both major parties together to solve Israel's pressing economic problems. While Likud leaders have mentioned the idea several times in the last month, it has now become in effect the central theme of their campaign.   ''The national unity government idea has always been very popular with voters,'' said Zeev Chafets, an Israeli political analyst with close ties to Likud, ''and since Likud is so far behind in the polls they have to try it. But I think what the Likud may really be trying to do is to put themselves in a position to be invited by Labor to join a national unity government.

In interviews in recent days, general agreement was expressed that the lasting impact of the airliner disaster, in which 269 people died, had been to tarnish the Soviet image and to make it easier for President Reagan in dealings with Western allies and at home.    In particular, the officials said, the incident has helped Washington rally the alliance at a time of considerable pressure from the Russians not to go ahead with the deployment of new American missiles.    The outrage expressed at the time over the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 over Soviet territory, however, provoked a furious reaction in Moscow that made it virtually impossible for any progress to be made toward a summit meeting that had been expected at this time last year. Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader who died last February, issued a statement less than a month after the plane's downing, saying it was impossible to do business with the Reagan Administration."

Others, however, caution that production lost during an auto strike could be made up after a settlement is reached, when economic activity would rebound strongly.    W.

At the same time, it does produce a slight narcotic effect, a barely perceptible feeling of euphoria. But that may be as much the result of suggestion as chemical content."

EVEN in an industry populated by   superstars, Gene M. Amdahl has   been a standout. In the 1960's, he had a leading role in the design of the International Business Machines Corporation's System/360, still one of the most successful mainframe computers ever produced. In the 1970's, he founded the Amdahl Computer Corporation, building computers that were compatible with, but usually less expensive than, I.B.M.'s - and thus pioneering an entirely new market. Indeed, for the last 20 years, Mr. Amdahl's name has been golden in computer circles.    So the response was overwhelmingly enthusiastic when, in 1980, Mr. Amdahl announced a third pass at the brass ring. What he proposed this time was nothing short of a technological revolution: a supercomputer built around giant silicon wafers, each capable of performing the work of 100 ordinary microchips."

So harsh has the verbal battle become, even before Mrs. Gandhi has named an election date, that opponents have been freely and openly accusing the Government of displaying a ''fascist mentality.''

Market participants were discouraged by a lack of investor demand and a Federal Reserve report published last Friday showing that the central bank is not adverse to rising interest rates so long as the economy continues to expand at a brisk rate.     Short-term interest rates rose by one-tenth of a percentage point and more, with the rate on three-month Treasury bills rising to 10.66 percent from 10.48 percent. Analysts attributed some of the upward pressure on short-term rates to the heavy supply of new Treasury bills, with $13.2 billion of bills auctioned yesterday, $8 billion of 20-day bills to be auctioned today and $8.25 billion of one-year bills on Thursday."

According to the Government's index of prices of finished goods, there was zero inflation in April and May.   But the June figure, due out this Friday, is expected to show an uptick - and, according to many analysts, the new number will be a better reflection of what is really happening to prices than the earlier data.  Lower food and fuel costs may have combined with abnormal weather patterns to distort the April and May statistics, said Kenneth T. Mayland, vice president and corporate economist of the First Pennsylvania Bank.  As for June, said Mr.  Mayland, ''We expect the index to be up three-tenths of 1 percent, because upward pressure on prices has been building for some time.'' The chief factor pushing up prices, he said, ''is that plant utilization is rapidly nearing capacity; output bottlenecks are already noticeable in the electrical and rubber industries.'' The key force working in the other direction, holding down producer prices, he noted, ''is the sharp rise in productivity stemming from the new technology being used on the plant floor.''"

But no realistic executive in the United States is discounting the importance of the Japanese as competitors and customers.     Now N.Y.U. is stressing the flipside of that as well: Japanese businessmen also need to understand American practices and markets. ''The diversity and plurality of the U.S. is a difficult concept for the Japanese businessmen to understand,'' explained Robert Hawkins, vice dean of N.Y.U.'s graduate business school. ''It's not only the language and cultural differences that make things difficult, but the myriad of public policies influencing U.S. business.''"

The drop in debt prices and increase in yields, which caught many analysts by surprise, was largely a result of heavy selling by speculative accounts at a time when investor buying was only modest, dealers in Government securities said.    In Friday's trading, Treasury bond prices fell a point, with the bellwether 12 1/2 percent issue due in 2014 offered at 102 1/8 to yield 12.23 percent, up from 12.09 percent Thursday. Three- month Treasury bills rose to 10.30 percent from 10.25 percent. Short- and long-term rates are still well below their recent peaks of Sept. 4, when the three-month bill was auctioned at a rate of 10.63 percent and 30-year bonds were yielding around 12.6 percent."

But the economic developments were not enough to bring on lower short-term interest rates until there were signals that the central bank was heeding the same data.

Inflation is 4 percent, far below the levels of the Carter Administration, and unemployment has dropped by 3.2 percentage points from the recession high of 10.6 near the end of 1982.    Nonetheless, Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic challenger, is indicting Reaganomics. He will press his claim that the prosperity the President sees in these numbers is illusory, and threatened by future Federal budget deficits that could reach $200 billion before the end of the decade."

Essentially, ITT's stock fell victim to a marketplace increasingly oriented to high dividend yields and with a low tolerance for any surprises in the form of bad news - the telltale sign of a skittish bear market.   The dividend cut - labeled ''a shocker'' by Herbert E. Goodfriend, an analyst at Prudential- Bache Securities - saw ITT's directors slash the quarterly payment to 25 cents a share from the former rate of 69 cents.    On Tuesday shares of the telecommunications and insurance conglomerate had closed at 31, thereby providing a comfortable cushion in the form of an annual dividend yield at 8.9 percent. But the swiftly changing fortunes of ITT saw its shares finish yesterday at prices to yield just under 5 percent. ''The 5 percent level is a sort of magic number, a time-tested rule of thumb, for all types of institutional investors, ranging from mutual funds to pension funds and college endowment funds,'' Mr. Goodfriend said."

The Reagan Administration has opposed moves in Congress to take such steps as limiting smokestack pollutants, arguing that more study is needed on the causes and effects of acid rain. Many legislators and public officials in the United States, pointing to dying forests and toxic levels of acidity in lakes and streams, have called for swift action by Mr. Reagan to reduce the pollutants that they believe to be the cause."

The Roman Catholic Church's sobriety campaign, which has been growing steadily over the last two years, reached a high point today, when priests in parishes all over the country led men and women in oaths pledging not to buy or drink vodka for a month.   A welder close to some of the factory committees reported that he considered the two-week period a test run that he hoped would lead to longer boycotts.    'All Change Takes Time'    ''You know, asking Poles to stop drinking is not so easy,'' the worker said. ''It is easier to get them out to throw stones. All change takes time.'' The man said that in addition to the appeals and church sermons, individual workers with what he called ''recognized authority'' would urge their co-workers to join the boycott."

Although investor demand has been strong as interest rates declined the past month, securities dealers said some increase in rates was probably needed to attract more buyers to this week's auctions of Treasury notes and bonds totaling $16.75 billion. In advance of today's sale of new three- year Treasury notes, dealers offered the issue with a yield of 12.48 percent, up from 12.34 percent late Friday.    Because the three-year issue offers a yield nearly as high as 10- and 30- year Treasury issues, but is less likely to suffer a severe drop in price if interest rates rise, it has attracted more invesvtor demand than the two longer-term issues, securities dealers said. The 10-year Treasury notes to be auctioned tomorrow were offered late yesterday at 12.70 percent, up from 12.54 percent, while the 30-year bonds to be auctioned Thursday were offered at 12.63 percent, up from 12.50 percent.

The current economic recovery is credited, at least in part, for spurring the shift. Some in the industry report that business is up as much as 60 percent from last year, and with more temporary employees, or ''temps,'' in the market place, more are being hired away for permanent jobs.   In an expanding economy, explained Herbert H. Bienstock, director of the Center for Labor and Urban Programs Research at City University in New York, ''temporary workers are used to test the market, to see if the expansion will be permanent.''   ''And it makes sense,'' Mr. Bienstock added, ''that the people who pinch hit will be offered a permanent place in the lineup.''"

Then the Government announced cuts in corporate and personal income taxes - not just one-shot deals, Mr. Mitterrand said, but reductions that would become a pattern for the rest of his presidency.

But they would eliminate an array of regulations that have heightened labor costs and hindered layoffs by troubled German companies, thus encouraging increased automation over the creation of new jobs."

''To abandon public ownership now would be no more than ideological spite,'' said Peter Shore, the Labor Party's spokesman on industrial matters, during a recent debate on Inmos's future in the House of Commons. As Labor sees it, the Government, venturing where private industry feared to tread, made Britain the only European nation with an independent, domestically owned mass producer of microchips.   Nevertheless, the question is not whether Inmos will be sold to private investors, but when and how. The Government sees selling its 75 percent stake in Inmos as the best way to recoup Britain's $88 million direct investment and $47 million in loan guarantees. A sale would also free Inmos to raise the money it needs for further expansion without placing new burdens on Britain's taxpayers."

But the recent history of ''voluntary'' export restraint suggests it is potentially the most protectionist action this Administration has yet taken.    Although the White House said the President was rejecting the mandatory quotas sought by American steel producers and the United Steelworkers, the practical effect of Mr. Reagan's decision will be little different.    ''We are moving toward globally managed trade in steel, similar to what already exists in textiles,'' commented Robert Z. Lawrence, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.   Barely noticed among documents handed out by the White House Tuesday in connection with the Presidential decision was a 12-page list of all the ''unfair'' trade practices of just about every steel-producing nation."

On Friday, the dollar had one of its biggest single-day gains. Bolstered by expectations of higher U.S. interest rates and an unwillingness by investors to sell dollars, the currency rose to record highs against the British pound, French franc, Italian lira and an 11 1/2- year high against the West German mark. Analysts had expected the dollar to weaken during August. ''The correction that was in all the charts didn't happen,'' one trader said, and many now expect the dollar to maintain its current high level for a long time. Much of the buying that continued to push the dollar higher evidently came from major corporations that will need dollars for their operations later this month. And that buying is expected to continue to keep the currency high.      Car prices are edging upward again. Ford and Nissan joined General Motors, Chrysler and American Motors in increasing the average sticker price of its 1985-model cars. Ford announced tentative plans for a 1.9 percent, or $225 per car, increase, and Nissan announced a $113 per car rise. The total increase for 1985 cars will come close to the 2 percent markup predicted by analysts for the model year that starts Oct. 1. Meanwhile, new car sales for the middle August period rose 11.6 percent over a year earlier."

The reason is that while interest rates can be increased to cover risks or hedged in spot, forward or futures and options markets, the ability to collect owed funds from borrowers can not be thus insured.    ''This helps explain why bankers keep raising their prime and other lending rates while the inflation rate, if not actually falling, has been pretty much under control,'' said John M. Blin, partner in Shatkin Investing Inc., Chicago. He is an architect of several financial futures markets and a former professor of economics at Northwestern University."

The resistance by the utility's industrial customers, led by the General Motors Corporation, ''puts us in a nonfinancial position with regard to getting the money to finish the plant,'' said John S. Selby, the chairman of the utility. He added that the board of directors had unanimously approved the shutdown and that no further negotiations were scheduled."

A strong leadership relegating its senior member to a ceremonial role . . . A power struggle between the Old Guard and Young Turks . . . A power struggle already concluded, with the baton passing to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the leadership's youngster at 53 . . . Or to Grigory V. Romanov, 60.   The buzz at diplomatic receptions has been: Who is mentioned how often in the press? Who might have gained or lost by the dismissal of Marshal Ogarkov?

Developing countries exhibit wide differences in performance and prospects between different groups. These may intensify, and within these distinct groups starker differences are likely to emerge. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is probable that annual average growth rates will be less than 3 percent, with some nations registering no growth at all. Under optimistic assumptions, we see possible average annual growth rates for middle-income countries exceeding 6 percent. But within this group there will still be some highly indebted nations which will register a far lower growth rate."

Israelis felt the stakes were very high, so high that a few talked openly about leaving the country if their party did not prevail.   This helps account for the widespread dissatisfaction with the results. On the one hand almost everybody got a piece of the pie. But in politics, when everybody wins, nobody wins.

A major factor in the drain on earnings at Manufacturers Hanover and three other leading New York banks that reported net income yesterday was a stricter interpretation of accounting rules that did not permit these banks to accrue some interest payments on their Argentine loans in their second-quarter earnings.    Although Federal regulators said that the tougher approach would not be required until this quarter's earnings are reported, most banks have decided to adhere to the stricter rules in the second quarter rerports.    As a result, Manufacturer Hanover's net income dropped 8.5 percent, to $73.7 million, in the second quarter of 1984, from $80.5 million in the comparable period of 1983. But on a per-share basis, the decline was a far steeper 29.5 percent, to $1.41 per share, from $2, primarily resulting from the company's acquisition May 1 of the CIT Financial Corporation. The large drop reflected the dilution caused by the issuance of five million shares of common stock, and dividends paid on $250 million of newly issued preferred stock, both to finance the acquisition."

Just as important, the deposit is only 23 miles from the railroad that connects Upper Volta with the Ivory Coast and the Atlantic Ocean, thus making it possible to develop the site without building a big, costly system of roads or main rail lines."

Shultz said today that the United States was ready to discuss a joint moratorium on tests of new space weapons with the Soviet Union, but he ruled out a Soviet proposal for a freeze of such tests in advance of actual negotiations.    Previously, the Reagan Administration said it was willing to engage in talks with the Russians on curbing the militarization of outer space so long as there were no conditions. The United States had not specifically addressed itself publicly to the moratorium question.   Mr. Shultz's remarks were apparently meant to convey an American readiness to discuss everything at the table, including a moratorium on future testing, but not to accept any Russian condition - in this case, a ban on tests while negotiations were taking place. The United States is expected to test an antisatellite weapon this fall."

The cutbacks, which had been rumored for weeks, reflect the difficulty that A.T.& T. is having in adapting to the competitive telecommunications environment since the breakup of the Bell System on Jan. 1.    In the past, A.T.& T. has routinely laid off manufacturing employees temporarily during economic downturns, but the cutbacks disclosed yesterday would be the first of their kind in modern times at the company, where lifelong employment has been commonplace.    Cost-Cutting Measures      A.T.& T., which has reported earnings well below its earlier projections for its first year without the local Bell operating companies, has been struggling for most of the year to bring its high costs under control. It has already frozen wages for 114,000 management- level employees, announced the closing of four plants and cut 5,000 workers from its payrolls through attrition, resignations and special early retirement programs. A.T.& T. employs 373,000 people nationwide.  After a flurry of rumors throughout the day, A.T.& T. officials said late yesterday that the cutbacks would be concentrated in the 53,000-employee equipment maintenance and service operations of AT&T Technologies, the unregulated A.T.& T. subsidiary that is spearheading the parent's push into the highly competitive computer business."

Last weekend, on Michelle's 12th birthday, Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical Inc., the Cincinnati-based manufacturer of Bendectin, agreed to put $120 million into a settlement fund to pay damages to the Noes and more than 700 other families who have filed lawsuits arising out of birth defects they say were caused by Bendectin.     Mass settlements in product liability cases are a relatively new phenomenon that theoretically allow companies to put product liability claims behind them in a quick, if expensive, stroke. The proposed Bendectin fund, to be endowed over 18 years, would be the third-largest settlement fund in history.   ''We're very happy about the settlement,'' Mrs. Noe said. ''Court proceedings can be very long and drawn out, and if we can, we'd like keep Michelle from going through a trial with all the attendant hassle and media.

This it intends to do in a subsequent document.   The present instruction has a much more limited and precise purpose: To draw the attention of pastors, theologians and all the faithful to the deviations, and risks of deviation, damaging to the faith and to Christian living, that are brought about by certain forms of liberation theology which use, in an insufficiently critical manner, concepts borrowed from various currents of Marxist thought.   This warning should in no way be interpreted as a disavowal of all those who want to respond generously and with an authentic evangelical spirit to the ''preferential option for the poor.''   In revealing to them their vocation as children of God, the Gospel has elicited in the hearts of mankind a demand and a positive will for a peaceful and just fraternal life in which everyone will find respect and the conditions for spiritual as well as material development. This requirement is no doubt at the very basis of the aspiration we are talking about here."

If one defines affirmative action in what Morris Abram, Vice Chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, calls its ''original and undefiled meaning,'' then the Memphis decision has no impact on affirmative action.  Affirmative action in its original sense means increased recruiting, training, counseling and educational opportunities, targeted to minorities and women, but open to all.  This nondiscriminatory affirmative action is aimed at breaking down the ''old-boy'' network in hiring and promotions and providing for equal employment opportunity without regard to race or gender and without contracting such opportunity for anyone else.   Preferential affirmative action seeks to reward persons for membership in a group, even if an employer did not discriminate against those persons, at the expense of innocent individuals.  The Memphis decision deals a sharp blow th this discriminatory form of affirmative action."

The drop reflected the profit squeeze afflicting most of the industry's refining and marketing operations.

Texaco, the nation's fourth-largest oil company, said its decline in earnings was largely a result of financing costs for its $10.1 billion acquisition of the Getty Oil Company.

(In Washington, the State Department said it had no knowledge of any contact between the two men and United States Embassy personnel in either El Salvador or Honduras, but that checks were being made with the embassies in both countries.    (Privately, State Deparment officials acknowledged that it was conceivable that the two men could have received some assistance in getting in touch with Salvadoran and Honduran military officials. One official noted, for example, that American citizens in foreign countries often seek embassy assistance in making commercial or government contacts and that embassy personnel generally do their best to be helpful.)"

Yesterday, for example, during the period the St. Regis Corporation was not trading on the New York Stock Exchange because of Rupert Murdoch's takeover bid, Jefferies was actively putting buyers and sellers together off the floor in the so-called third market.     Jefferies has also been eager to court the international market, which could have played a part in the Big Board's decision a few weeks ago to consider staying open around the clock. According to Ronald A. Alghini, the 44-year-old president and chief operating officer of Jefferies, his firm may even buy into a London brokerage firm to prepare for the day when rules on the London Stock Exchange might be liberalized to allow American firms to trade there. That would put more pressure on the New York exchange to remain open and compete for the business."

For nearly 40 years, August Sebastiani was the living embodiment of the California vineyard that bears his name. Wearing bib overalls and affecting the demeanor of a simple but crafty farmer, he was as omnipresent in his company's marketing efforts as is Frank Perdue, the chicken king, in his. ''There is no Mr. Almaden, and Paul Masson has been dead a long time,'' Mr. Sebastiani commented a few years ago. ''But,'' he was quick to add, ''there    is    a Mr. Sebastiani.''   Thus, when August Sebastiani died in 1980 at the age of 66, many of his fellow vintners predicted that Sebastiani Vineyards would not long survive him. His son Sam, then 38 years old, had been running the business end of the winery. Sam, too, is flamboyant in his attire - his chosen persona is that of the wealthy rancher, replete with expensive cowboy shirts and boots. But until his father's death, he was the quintessential low- profile businessman when it came to marketing. Wine industry insiders doubted he would ever manifest the type of strong personality that had made Sebastiani Vineyards a smashing success."

''For the next 10 or 15 years, Japan has no choice but to follow the American lead,'' said Kikuo Okuda, editor of Business Computer News.

All year long they had been building up mountainous amounts of short-term debt because the dramatically lower rates in 90-day commercial paper or from banks were too tempting to pass up.     The expected torrent, however, turned out to be a trickle. A few big names such as Texaco, Xerox and Georgia Pacific returned to the bond market, but the vast majority of industrial corporations with balance sheets overloaded by short-term debt have elected to hold out for even lower rates. And in recent weeks, when the cost of borrowing beyond several years moved up again, the calendar of coming bond offerings has taken on a decidedly blank look.    ''Many companies are using the election as a reason to sit back and see if rates will come down,'' said David C. Batten, a managing director of the First Boston Corporation. Although there was some pickup in bond financing over the past several months, he said, ''it was relatively small considering the significant group of companies waiting for lower rates.''"

The decrease indicated that factory output would slacken correspondingly in coming months, but was not taken as a sign of any abrupt halt to the economy's expansion. (Page D1.)   Consumer prices were up only 0.2 percent in June, indicating that the low inflation that has persisted since the recession may be moving even lower. The rise, equal to May's, represents a compound annual rate of 2 percent. Prices of services were up, but gasoline and clothing were off with food barely higher. (D1.)

Nothing, it seemed to him, could be more ludicrous.  Had he not orchestrated the economy's strongest recovery in more than 30 years, with the lowest inflation in more than 10? Had he not engineered a recovery that at almost every turn produced better results than many predicted? As the second half of 1984 begins, in fact, Mr. Reagan has every reason to be confident about the future - at least through the November election. Though many economists see problems after that, particularly in 1985, the economy has rarely shone so brightly on a President facing re-election.  Mr. Reagan is presiding over the recovery that wouldn't stop. Eighteen months after the expansion began, the economy is still booming, with growth soaring to 9.7 percent in the first quarter and 5.7 percent, by preliminary estimates, in the second. Despite such heated activity, inflation remains in check at 4.6 percent for the year. And unemployment, currently at 7.4 percent, is already below the 7.5 percent rate where it hovered on election day 1980. All of which apparently has made voters feel good. According to the University of Michigan's sentiment survey, confidence in the economy among consumers is the highest it has been since the mid-1960's."

The decline, which was steeper than most analysts expected, was mainly attributed to rising interest rates that, for conventional mortgages, briefly exceeded 15 percent this summer.    August was the second consecutive month of falling housing starts, representing further evidence of an overall slowing of the economic expansion dating from late 1982.

Demand was high and, since overhead was virtually nonexistent, the high school entrepreneur kept beefing up inventory, tripling his floor space in just a couple of years.    Music tastes and record sizes are different today, of course, but Mr. Solomon has stuck with the approach that he stumbled on in high school. Since 1960, when he finally moved his first store to a stand-alone location across the street, his record supermarkets have grown into a chain of nearly 40 outlets, with shelf after shelf of records and tapes.    This ''deep catalogue'' approach has been rather attention-getting in many American communities. ''Solomon has the highest profile in any town he comes into with his record stores,'' says an executive with Musicland, the nation's largest chain of record stores, among them the Sam Goody outlets."

This development could be good for consumers to the extent that falling prices for commodities keep the inflation rate low. But broadly falling consumer prices is a worrisome economic phenomenon known as deflation, usually associated with periods of economic contraction or even depression.    Deflation, if it develops, would pose serious problems for the companies, mines and farmers that produce these commodities as well as for the debtor nations of the third world that need higher prices for their commodity exports to help pay off their huge bank debts.    'Tough Year' for Farmers    ''With commodity prices so low, it's going to be an extremely tough year for the U.S. farmer,'' said David J.

Ten years ago such enterprises were scarce. But, much as black-oriented ad agencies sprang up more than a decade ago to serve that important market, companies are now forming to reach the estimated 15 million Hispanic people in the United States with spending power estimated between $70 billion and $80 billion a year.    ''Now there are more than 100 companies that feel they are Hispanic marketing experts,'' said Carlos Montemayor, president of Montemayor & Asociados, a San Antonio agency that started this year."

Nuclear reactors are    abandoned because of cost overruns, or the rate rises that would accompany their completion threaten ''rate shock.'' At the same time, evidence mounts that the alternative fuel, coal, aggravates acid rain.    Accordingly, consumer advocates, environmentalists and other utility critics are trying to reduce the need to build new plants. They are pushing for investments in efficiency, to allow existing supplies of power to be stretched further, and they are seeking new regulatory structures that remove the financial incentive of the utilities to build new plants."

These refugees, most of them criminals and mental patients, according to American officials, were among 125,000 Cubans who came to Florida during the boatlift."

Mr. Peres is coming to Washington for talks with President Reagan on Oct. 9.

Wall Street's handicappers cited two reasons for their dour predictions about Ameritech: it is situated in one of the nation's slowest-growing regions in terms of population, and its service area includes the Middle West's Rust Belt and its array of declining industries.    But once the regionals went into business last Jan. 1, Ameritech surprised everyone by sprinting out in front of its sister companies. In its first two quarters, Ameritech's return on equity was the highest of the regionals. It was the first regional to market cellular mobile telephones, and, many industry analysts say, it has achieved the lowest cost per telephone line."

Morgan replaced the Equitable Life Assurance Society as the fund's outside adviser earlier this year.","  In a letter to the Labor Department this week, Morgan Stanley said it now wants to take charge of the fund's stocks from seven outside managers in order to increase efficiency, and lower commissions and management fees by more than $4.3 million a year.   The Labor Department is expected to consider whether Morgan Stanley would have a conflict of interest under this arrangement, because the firm would be deciding how much money should be put into stocks - in effect determining how much it should collect in stock commissions.    In response, Morgan proposed an oversight committee with members from outside the firm to monitor its recommendations and insure that the proper decisions were made."

The criticism came four days before the start of an official Vatican interrogation of a leading Brazilian theologian who is an exponent of the doctrine."

Retiring the warrants would remove the last vestige of the 1980 crisis, which stemmed from a combination of bad loans and heavy investments in Government securities that fell in price when interest rates soared. The resulting liquidity crisis led to a precedent-setting rescue that brought together the resources of banks and the Government. First Pennsylvania Bank, then the nation's 23d-largest commercial bank, received a $500 million, five-year rescue loan, with the F.D.I.C. putting up $325 million and a group of 26 banks lending $175 million and setting up a $1 billion line of credit."

The outlook for continued low inflation - which attracted investors to bonds and fueled the recent rally - remains in place. Inflation for 1985 is now forecast to be between 3 percent and 6 percent, down from previous estimates of 5 percent to 9 percent.    But with Treasury bond yields down to about 12 1/2 percent, there is concern that investor attention might shift away from the favorable inflation outlook to the strong performance of the economy. Based on past business cycles, the expanding economy is expected to increase credit demands and put upward pressure on interest rates."

Administration officials, economists and corporate executives all predicted that the nation's exports would continue to climb in the year ahead, but they said the increase would hardly reduce the trade deficit because import levels are also rising.    The Commerce Department reported that exports rose to $19.4 billion in July, was up $1.8 billion, or 10.3 percent, from the previous month. The July figures, part of an upward trend in exports over all, represented the highest level of exports since September 1981."

Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, but more assertive than that of George McGovern, the party's 1972 nominee.    In interviews, former officials from Democratic and Republican administrations singled out Walter F. Mondale's ardent advocacy of a negotiated, verifiable freeze on the production, testing and deployment of nuclear arms as the most significant departure from past election-year platforms.   Other specialists cite a plank pushed through by Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and some of Mr. Mondale's comments about Central America as signals of a less assertive American role in the world than in the Truman, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.    Previous Involvements    Under those Democratic Presidents, the United States took on the defense of Korea, Greece, Turkey and Vietnam, and President Carter declared protection for the Persian Gulf.   The Hart amendment, eventually accepted by the Mondale camp, emphasized the Democratic Party's general reluctance to involve American combat forces in third-world troublespots like the Persian Gulf, except in limited circumstances."

The North Korean Government in Pyongyang had said it was ready to send food and other assistance to victims of severe floods in the South that early this month killed about 190 people, left 200,000 homeless and damaged crops.

'RED KEN': WINNER TO TAKE LONDON,"   London is about to become a city without a city government.    The abolition of the Greater London Council in favor of the city's 32 boroughs has pitted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher against Ken Livingstone - ''Red Ken'' to headline writers - the radical Socialist council leader whose efforts to cut fares for public transport and provide grants to groups such as Babies Against the Bomb have already shocked a wide audience.   The Daily Telegraph called him ''the amazing man on the flying trapeze who fell on London.''   For months, Londoners have been barraged with posters and other appeals urging them to ''Save the G.L.C.,'' a campaign that in the end will probably cost the taxpayers some $13 million.   Last week, supported by $104,000 in council money, actors portrayed Mrs. Thatcher as a predatory fairy queen and Mr. Livingstone as a genial but ominous half-mortal, half-fairy in a production of ''The Ratepayers' Iolanthe'' at Queen Elizabeth Hall."

Reed yesterday began moving his key lieutenants into senior positions in the area of the company headed by Thomas O. Theobald, who was Mr. Reed's chief rival for the No. 1 spot. But Mr. Reed also promoted a number of senior officials who report to Mr. Theobald, signaling that his former rival's staff will still have opportunities within the organization.   Ostensibly, the major managerial change was the naming of James D. Farley, 58 years old, as vice chairman, which makes him a director. But Mr. Farley's actual responsibilities within the bank have been narrowed. Formerly in charge of corporate business in Latin America, Citicorp's single biggest profit center, Mr. Farley will now be responsible for supervising international debt restructurings and for ''special worldwide customer-relations duties.''"

After a decade of repeated management changes that left a legacy of a swollen corporate structure and depressed profits, Newsweek has been systematically streamlining itself in recent months under the close scrutiny of the the Washington Post Company, Newsweek's owner.    In late July, tightened cost controls and new operating procedures were installed for the magazine's editorial staff, which had largely escaped the companywide effort at improving profits and efficiency.   Changes in Character Seen    Although Newsweek executives insist that the magazine's quality will not be affected, some staff members say the relatively free-wheeling and independent character of Newsweek Inc. - the corporate body that publishes the magazine - is changing for the worse as it responds to the Post Company's heightened pressure for an improved bottom line.   The goal, both Post and Newsweek officials say, is to maintain the quality of the magazine while increasing a disappointing profit margin of 5.1 percent in 1983 to 12 percent in several years."

Analysts and industry sources also said American oil companies had cut their crude oil shipments from the Middle East in an effort to tighten supplies and halt the decline in world oil prices.

Best known for its condensed milk from ''contented cows,'' Carnation makes more than 200 products, including Coffee-mate, Instant Breakfast and Contadina tomato products. The company is first in the condensed milk market, first in tomato paste and second - to Ralston Purina - in pet foods.   Five years ago, Nestle took a look at Carnation, its strong balance sheet and well-known brands, and reportedly considered making a bid for the company then. But a deal did not materialize. Carnation, an old-line company run by the Stuart family until late last year, was still wedded to the notion of family management."

The Japanese report, an annual evaluation of security problems prepared by the Defense Agency, cited the United States deployment of new bombers and Tomahawk nuclear cruise missiles in the Pacific as signs of an effort to ''strengthen the credibility of deterrence.''"

Leonardo Boff, a leading exponent of the controversial interpretation of Christian teachings that has taken strong root in Latin America in the past 15 years, has been summoned to Rome to answer charges that he has committed serious doctrinal errors.    To its advocates, liberation theology, with its emphasis on the church's obligation to combat economic and social oppression, is an urgent response to the sufferings of the Latin American masses. Friar Boff, some of whose works have already been condemned by the Vatican, has written, ''The liberation theologian takes a place on the side of the poor and oppressed.'' He rejects the status quo and calls for structural changes in society."

Political and military leaders of the North Atlantic alliance are said to regard the army's reorganization as one of the most significant recent military developments in Western Europe, one that should improve France's effectiveness against any aggression by the Warsaw Pact.    France withdrew from the integrated command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1967. Its armed services, while occasionally taking part in NATO exercises on a limited scale, have developed their own organization, tactics and weapons.

So far, the townhouses seem to be favored.    The setting is Dickerson Pond, a natural lake that was expanded to its present 50-acre size in the 1920's by a man-made dam. On the northern, more elevated bank of the pond, sits a majestic old hotel called Valeria. Stoned-faced and imposing, with an enclosed inner courtyard and a tower, it was built in the early 1920's by a private foundation as a retreat and convalescent center. The hotel closed in the mid-1970's and was purchased five years ago by a developer, along with the rest of the property. The five buildings of the complex were subsequently gutted and rehabilitated into 47 condominium apartments."

The marketplace will decide the future of nuclear power, as its inevitable forces have shaped the nuclear industry's past. The units on-line today have saved their customers at least $30 billion, and perhaps as much as $70 billion by replacing more costly coal or astronomically more costly oil. Witness, for example, the current fight in the State of New York over who will get the cheap power from the Fitzpatrick nuclear plant.

The talks, which began in June when Secretary of State George P. Shultz made an unexpected visit to Managua, have dealt with substantive security issues, including United States demands that Nicaragua end its support of guerrillas in El Salvador, according to the officials.   ''There's been no grandstanding or stalling about procedural issues,'' an official familiar with the discussions said.   ''The talks moved quickly into a serious discussion of the issues that divide us,'' he said. ''The question now is whether either country has the will to reach a settlement. The vehicle for producing one is in place and works well.'' As a result, the officials said, the discourse between Washington and Managua, although still marked by antagonistic exchanges in public, has become considerably less hostile in private."

In fact, some experts are beginning to wonder if the recent rally in bond prices, which began about two weeks ago, represents something more than a mere respite in what is generally seen as a bear market for bonds.    In large part, the change in attitude is due to a shift in market perceptions about inflation, which is now seen as remaining in the 3 percent to 4 percent range for the balance of the year, at least.    ''The odds are only slightly better than 50-50 that those who expect long- term interest rates to rise further are right,'' said Alan Greenspan, president of Townsend-Greenspan & Company, a New York-based economic forecasting concern. ''We are already at the point where the inflation premiums built into the long bond are quite high. The only place that one could argue for a further dip in bond prices is that the economy is still very strong.''"

Such a combination of austerity measures, often augmented by currency and import controls, has been successfully employed in a number of countries plagued by acute inflation, ballooning budget and trade deficits, and large foreign debts.   The idea is to reverse the country's course of consuming more than it produces. The measures are politically difficult to achieve, given their painful impact on consumers, whose standard of living will decline as they are forced to pay higher taxes, pay higher prices for certain goods and go without some government subsidies and services. But as many Latin American debtor nations have recently found, international lenders typically require an austerity program before extending further aid."

The Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, offered no specific proposals in his remarks to President Chun Doo Hwan, and Japanese Government officials emphasized that his comments did not signal a Japanese shift away from basic support for South Korean diplomatic positions.   Japan has some economic ties but no formal relations with the North Korean Government in Pyongyang. Mr. Nakasone reportedly said there was ''no reason why this policy should change unless there is a major change in the international situation.''   Nevertheless, any reference to possible fresh initiatives to North Korea - no matter how thickly veiled - is enough to raise concern among South Korean officials. Mr. Chun, who met with Mr. Nakasone for an hour Friday morning, was said to have called on Japan to act ''prudently and cautiously'' in dealing with Pyongyang."

Mr. Moynihan, a New York Democrat who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the C.I.A. had told him that the two were not directly or indirectly associated with the agency, which has supported the Nicaraguan rebels since 1981. Mr. Moynihan said he had been told that the helicopter was on a reconnaissance mission after a rebel ground attack on a Nicaraguan military outpost.    There have previously been no known American deaths in Nicaragua associated with the three-year-old rebel fight against the Sandinista Government. A primary concern in Congress about American support for the rebels has been the possibility that C.I.A. employees or other Americans would become involved in the fighting.    Some members of Congress have warned that the loss of American lives in the conflict could draw the United States into a more direct and extensive military involvement. The Reagan Administration, partly in response to these concerns, has a standing policy that American Government employees, or anyone working on contract for the Government, shall not take part in any activities inside Nicaragua."

Weaker prices for Treasury notes and bonds were not surprising in the wake of the sharp gains that occurred in the past few weeks, many analysts said. They added that prices were also undermined by fears that the Treasury would issue new regulations restricting the sale to foreign investors of zero-coupon securities. If fewer of the secuities can be sold to foreigners, then more of the Treasury's debt must be placed with domestic investors, presumably at higher interest rates than if foreigners were buying as well."

These regional agreements generally allow interstate mergers and acquisitions between banks in states that are parties to the pact, while excluding others, notably New York and California. For that reason, some big New York banks oppose the bill, and it was their point of view that Senator Moynihan was expressing."

While it has been the Government's wish for several years that Monday-to- Friday work weeks be adopted, a Labor Ministry study issued last spring showed that only 25 percent of all workers enjoyed a full two days off each week.   Still, the percentage is rising steadily, and most labor experts assume it is only a matter of time before Japan resembles the West more closely in this regard.    But major elements of the advisory group's proposal are likely to arouse controversy and are by no means guaranteed to become official policy. They are expected, nonetheless, to give fresh impetus to a broader national debate, long under way, over whether the Japanese toil too hard or whether their well- known work ethic is eroding."

It agreed to make purchases from Japan, with payment due in yen several months later. The difficulty was that the value of the yen could - and did - swing sharply in those intervening months, altering Apple's dollar costs.     Usually, to hedge such risks, companies agree to buy the yen, marks, pounds or other currency needed several months later at a fixed price in the forward market, paying in dollars. Apple, however, chose a new hedge, the currency option.    Options are the right to buy or sell a set amount of a currency at a specified date. They eliminate the risk of a loss due to exchange movements, but unlike a forward contract, still give the holder a chance to come out ahead if the currency fluctuations are in its favor."

This evening the Pope received a rousing response of the sort usually reserved for rock stars from a group of 60,000 teen-agers and young adults at a Montreal stadium.     ''In times of darkness do not seek an escape,'' the Pope said. ''Have the courage to resist the dealers in deception who make capital of your hunger for happiness and who make you pay dearly for a moment of 'artificial paradise,' a whiff of smoke, a bout of drinking or drugs.

''Human motivations,'' he adds, ''are basically to excel and do the best you can - not to do poorly on the hope that someone will rescue you.''   Following the debate over what caused the near- collapse of the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company, and what should be done to prevent future disasters, attention is focusing on whether bailouts of huge banks are necessary to save the financial system or whether the expectation of such bailouts undermines the system's security by leading to careless lending practices."

J., company, which transferred its listing to the Big Board from Amex on Friday, is just about doubling its advertising budget, to about $2 million, and will start running ads in consumer business publications in addition to its usual promotions in the computer trade press."

But he pledged the abuses would not continue under his command.    The director, Col. Rinaldo Golcher, said in an interview this week that a recent decision to disband the treasury police's intelligence squad, known as S-2, had been made because he and President Jose Napoleon Duarte believed the unit had carried out political murders and other human rights abuses.   ''It was a camp inside the camp,'' Colonel Golcher said. ''Even the other soldiers here feared it.''"

The church group investigated reports of a mass killing in northern Cabanas Province and said troops of the elite United States -trained Atlacatl Battalion shot 68 peasants to death in a ''search and destroy operation'' between July 18 and 22 in three villages some 25 miles north of the capital."

After the rules take effect Sept. 7, the United States will accept only products either made completely in the exporting country or products substantially changed there.   The rules could force Hong Kong's garment exporters - who have commonly had much of their clothing assembled in China and other countries where labor costs are lower - to alter a fundamental business practice."

By dialing a special code, long-distance customers will be able to have their calls bypass their selected carrier and be carried on A.T.& T. By selecting other long-distance company codes, they can similarly bypass their selected carrier and gain access to other companies as well.    You can only choose one primary long-distance company per telephone line. Then you just dial one plus the area code and telephone number to place your long-distance calls. To use another long-distance company, you would have to first dial a special five- digit long-distance access code before the number. Until now, customers wanting to use another carrier had to dial as many as 12 to 14 extra digits."

It is growing faster and with less inflation than it has for two decades.  Experts think the colossal Federal budget deficits, of almost $200 billion a year, proved far more stimulative than they expected. With hindsight, some also suspect that the recession was unusually harsh on consumers, producing an orgy of post-recession spending that has continued all through the recovery.    Even those explanations do not go far enough, in some economists' view. They say the economy is undergoing some important shifts. The record number of children born in the years after World War II are buying homes, furniture and appliances, giving the country a far bigger boost than they did as teen-agers buying soda pop and blue jeans."

So it is hardly surprising that in the campaigning for this year's election on Sept. 4, the issue is being approached with caution.    Nonetheless, a growing body of opinion holds that Petro-Canada - now Canada's biggest oil company in assets, with $6.4 billion in United States dollars- may need private money to pay its mounting bills, regardless of whether the Liberal Prime Minister, John Turner, or the Tory challenger, Brian Mulroney, wins the election.   Patricia Carney, the Conservatives' Parliamentary energy critic, recently said the company would get ''no more handouts'' if the Tories take power. Michael Pitfield, now a senator and previously the top aide to former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, has discussed selling shares in Petro-Canada. And Donald Johnston, a surprisingly tough candidate for the Liberal leadership won by Mr. Turner, has advocated selling Petro- Canada's service stations."

Showdown Could Be Averted    An accord or substantial progress could avert a showdown on a payment of $750 million due on Saturday and some $900 million due on Sept. 30 and open the way for Argentina to begin talks with its creditors to reschedule payments on $44.4 billion in debt.

Billy Graham stood before the icons of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Resurrection today and exhorted the congregation to become followers of Christ.   ''Today the world is in trouble; you hear it on the radio, you see it on television and you read it in the papers,'' Mr. Graham thundered, with an interpreter quickly falling into his cadence, building to the main thrust: ''Jesus Christ said I am the way . . .''   It was a classic Billy Graham sermon, and some in the congregation wept while others listened raptly and mumbled, ''beautiful, magnificent.'' An Orthodox official, Metropolitan Filaret of Minsk, who officiated at the three-hour liturgy, extolled Mr. Graham's words and presented him with an icon of the Holy Trinity.

That reputation for instability may change with the announcement yesterday that Barry Diller, the chairman of the Paramount Pictures Corporation and head of the entertainment group at Gulf and Western Industries, would become Fox's chief executive on Oct. 1.    Mr. Diller succeeds Alan J. Hirschfield, whose resignation was announced on Monday after months of speculation that he would be let go by Marvin Davis, the company's owner.   There was little doubt in Hollywood or on Wall Street yesterday that Mr. Hirschfield's three-year reign at Fox had ended involuntarily."

The Tax Reform Act of 1984 makes changes in three key areas: alimony, property transfers and dependency exemptions. The law will finally remove a major obstacle to property settlements that often meant husbands were saddled with a large capital gains tax on property that they transferred to their ex-wives as part of the settlement. And it will simplify the wrangling over which parent gets the dependency exemption for any children."

''They're coming off a brutal first half and this has brought smiles to a lot of sour faces,'' said Jeffrey M. Schaefer, senior vice president of the Securities Industry Association. ''A lackluster July may turn into a dynamite August.''     It's a rule-of-thumb that the industry breaks even after about 90 million shares, so volumes like Friday's record 238.8 million on the New York Stock Exchange goes directly to the bottom line. Wall Street's dismal 4 percent after-tax return on equity could rise to 10 to 14 percent, if this activity continues another month or two, according to Mr. Schaefer. Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services, predicts 90- to 100 million-share days through September.  Institutions have so far been the big players, trading massive blocks.  Now all eyes are on the little investor, since the average profit per share is about 40 cents for retail trades compared with about 10 cents a share for institutions. Mr. Long expects that if equity prices continue to rise, small investors should return to the market this week or next."

However, while recombinant DNA technology gives promise of many new products and opens up vast new areas of research in the life sciences, a recent lawsuit involving the proposed release into the environment of genetically engineered microorganisms for agricultural use has renewed the debate about the need for increased regulatory control.  No one contests the need to regulate products, to ensure that they are safe and effective. But adequate authority already exists for such regulation, including products of biotechnology.

By contrast, this firm had held to progressively increasing degrees of bearishness, starting in July 1983, on prospects for equities.

To the surprise of almost everyone, this has not stifled debate, but seems to have fostered freer and livelier exchanges than were customary under the traditional two-party system.   Even so, Jamaicans are not happy with the present situation and say it is only a matter of time before they return to the system they inherited from the British. In fact, most Jamaicans say the one-party Parliament would probably not be working so well were it not for the country's commitment to its traditional form of government.   One thing that is helping to keep the governing party responsive, diplomats and political analysts say, is concern that it not be seen to be abusing power."

The accords were said to include a new private bank credit to East Germany and a reduction of the obligatory foreign exchange demanded of West German visitors to the Communist state.   The news of the package, which was reported by West German television and broadly confirmed by diplomats and banking sources, came as a tense situation was defused at the West German diplomatic mission in East Berlin.   All but 6 of 55 East Germans who had taken refuge in the mission were said to have left the building. They were reportedly reassured by commitments that they would eventually be allowed to emigrate to the West."

T. Rama Rao speaks to a political rally, many people hear the voice of the Hindu god Krishna or Vishnu or Rama. That's because Mr. Rama Rao, who was returned to power Sunday as Chief Minister of a southern Indian state, used to play deities when he was a film star.  Today, a day after forces loyal to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi conceded defeat and reinstated him as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Rama Rao's former cinematic persona seemed to figure in the accolades. He has emerged as a political hero as well as a figure around whom the usually fragmented national opposition can rally.    Mrs. Gandhi is thought to have repaired her damaged political image by bowing to the will of the majority in Andhra Pradesh. But the praise for Mr. Rama Rao has been something more."

They said the previous American proposal for an agenda had not mentioned the issue.   On Friday a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Viktor G. Komplektov, said the previous American reply to a proposal Monday by Moscow for a joint affirmation of readiness to negotiate showed that ''the U.S. does not want talks on such a vital problem as the banning of space weapons.''   One Administration official said the document proposed today represented ''a formulation we think the Soviets will be more comfortable with.''"

Inflation for the entire economy fell to a 3.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter from 4.4 percent in the first quarter, the department reported.   ''I don't know how you can write a script for a better recovery than we're seeing right now,'' said Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who led the Administration's exultation about the continued good economic news.   Democrats have acknowledged that the economy's strong performance was a big advantage for President Reagan's re-election bid and that his Democratic challenger, Walter F. Mondale, has yet to discover a potent economic theme for the campaign."

Rather than continuing to moderate between now and year-end - as projected by many governmental and private economists - the rate of economic growth, some analysts now predict, will increase instead.     In their interpretation, these economists tend to play down recent Government reports as well as activity in the credit markets that suggest softening conditions. Rather, they focus on renewed vigor in consumer spending, on the positive aspects of speedy resolution of labor negotiations with the automobile and coal workers and on a stabilization and possible improvement in the nation's foreign trade deficit."

''It is not that there were no political trials in Yugoslavia before,'' said Srdja Popovic, a lawyer representing four of the accused.    There are perhaps as many as 500 people in jail for advocating their beliefs. But they are mainly Croats and Albanians who want to separate their ethnic territories from Yugoslavia.   The case against the six is different because they are known through Yugoslav press reports on their dissident activities and because the case is being pursued in Serbia, which has long had a reputation for liberalism."

But now that it has settled its nettlesome, decade- long antitrust dispute with the Common Market, the company is accelerating a campaign to change that image.    It is striking up alliances with the biggest names in European telecommunications - British Telecom and STET, Italy's Government-controlled telephone company, for example - and it has a foot in the door, if not full acceptance, in Europe's two largest high-technology research programs.   At the same time, the company says it has given more decision-making authority to the nationals who head the major I.B.M. subsidiaries in Britain, France, West Germany and Italy.    ''They will be given goals to reach, but the strategic decisions about how to reach them will be their own,'' a spokesman for I.B.M. Europe said. Major decisions will continue to be reviewed at I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., or at its European head office in Paris, however."

No matter who wins in November, Washington's white-collar population will be even more footloose than usual, as political jobs change hands, many at the Pentagon.     The chief scientist there, Richard DeLauer, who is Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, will be resigning after the election to form what he calls a ''federation'' of private consultants.    He said recently that he has discussed the notion with Louis Meyer, retired vice president for policy planning at the Comsat General Corporation; Eugene Fubini, a longtime Government adviser on military and intelligence technology; Sol Love, former president and chief executive of the LTV Corporation's Vought division, and several acquaintances from the TRW Corporation, where Mr. DeLauer was executive vice president before joining the Reagan Administration."
