Citing the lingering impact of halted sales in parts of Europe this summer, as well as sluggishness in other markets, Coke said unit case volume in the third quarter would increase only at a low single-digit rate. Analysts figure the increase to be about 2 percent, which is down slightly from the 3 percent to 4 percent they had originally estimated.    As a result, the company lowered earnings expectations by 3 cents to 5 cents a share. Including the product recall in Europe, which will account for 2 cents to 3 cents against earnings, third-quarter profits may be as low as 31 cents a share, in contrast to the 36 cents analysts had been expecting.

His elevation to the House of Lords moves up the date of the by-election for his seat in Parliament to Sept. 23, helping the governing Labor Party by limiting the time the Scottish Nationalists can mount an organized challenge.    Warren Hoge (NYT)    RUSSIA: DAILY DUE BACK ON STANDS  Kommersant, one of Moscow's most respected daily newspapers, will resume publication today after it was shut down for a day by city authorities for what were said to be violations of fire safety codes. Editors of the paper, which was recently bought by Boris A. Berezovsky, a financier and media magnate with close ties to the Kremlin, denounced the shutdown as a ''silly'' attempt by Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow to put pressure on the news media. Celestine Bohlen (NYT)    RUSSIA: DAGESTAN CAMPAIGN  Military officials said they were on the verge of reclaiming control of territory seized two weeks ago by Islamic militants who crossed into Dagestan Province from the secessionist republic of Chechnya. A spokesman for the militants said they had withdrawn in order to regroup as they shift tactics in their fight for Dagestan's independence. According to military reports, Russian troops were still engaged in scattered fighting in the mountainous region between Dagestan and Chechnya.    Celestine Bohlen (NYT)    RUSSIA: NEW OPPOSITION ALLIANCE  Sergei V. Stepashin, one of Russia's former Prime Ministers, announced that he would join forces with Grigory Yavlinsky's liberal opposition party Yabloko in parliamentary elections in December. Mr. Stepashin, whose three months in office gave him a national reputation and modest popularity, backed out of a coalition last weekend with parties made up of former allies of President Boris N.Yeltsin.    Celestine Bohlen (NYT)    ASIA    KYRGYZSTAN: SECURITY SUMMIT TALKS  President Boris B. Yeltsin of Russia arrived in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, to take part in a meeting today on security and cooperation in the region with the leaders of China, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. The officials were arriving as Kyrgyzstan forces traded fire with gunmen who crossed from Tajikistan, seized hostages and occupied three villages.    (Reuters, AP)    THAILAND: WARRANT FOR BUDDHIST LEADER  About 10,000 followers of the leader of a Buddhist sect, Phra Dhammachayo, 55, gathered at their Dhammakaya temple compound outside Bangkok to prevent his arrest on charges of fraud, embezzlement and corruption. The arrest warrant capped a police investigation into allegations that the monk and his top aides illegally amassed a fortune estimated at $110 million. The sect has branches in 10 countries, including the United States.    (AP)    MIDDLE EAST    ISRAEL: PALESTINIANS QUIT TALKS  Palestinian negotiators discussing a prisoner release with Israel suspended the meetings, saying no progress had been made. Hisham Abdel Razek, the Palestinian Minister for Prisoners, called the meetings ''a waste of time.'' The failure is likely to put a damper on talks in Washington on Thursday between Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and two top Palestinian negotiators, Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas.    (AP)    THE AMERICAS    VENEZUELA: HIGH COURT CHIEF QUITS  Accusing her colleagues of capitulating to political pressure by ruling that a new constitutional assembly has authority to take control of the judicial system, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Cecilia Sosa, has resigned. ''The court simply committed suicide to avoid being assassinated,'' she said in a nationally televised news conference. ''But the result is the same: it is dead.'' She also criticized Congress and political parties for not resisting what she called attempts by President Hugo Chavez to concentrate power in his own hands through the assembly.    Larry Rohter (NYT)    ARGENTINA: GAY SOLDIERS  Gen. Martin Balza, who retires as the commander of the army in December, suggested that the military code should be amended so that military personnel found to be homosexuals would no longer face prison sentences of up to six years. But he added that he did not want to allow declared homosexuals to enter the military. Any change in the military code must be approved by the high command and the Defense Ministry.    Clifford Krauss (NYT)    MEXICO: OPPOSITION TALKS FALTER  Negotiations to form a coalition of opposition parties for the July 2000 general elections turned difficult. Eight parties opposed to the Institutional Revolutionary Party of President Ernesto Zedillo have written a joint electoral platform, but have failed to agree on how to select a single presidential candidate. The center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution suggested that the months of talks should end, in success or failure, by Aug. 31. But the pro-business National Action Party said it would ignore that deadline.
