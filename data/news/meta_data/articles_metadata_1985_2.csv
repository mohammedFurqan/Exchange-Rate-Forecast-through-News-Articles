Many such trusts, particularly the mortgage trusts that concentrated on financing existing or developing property, had to borrow at higher interest rates than they earned when the prime lending rate soared. As a result, their share prices plummeted.   Conditions in the industry have changed, and the emphasis now is on equity trusts that own investment-grade income-producing property such as office buildings and shopping centers. But increasing attention is being focused on a version of the trusts called finite-life real estate investment trusts. These are abbreviated FREIT's and pronounced ''freets.''"

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with vigorous demonstrations against racism that included a rally of 4,000 people outside the South African Embassy in Washington and the barricading of a Columbia University building.    At Columbia's campus on Morningside Heights in Manhattan, protesters of racial separation in South Africa wrapped a silver-link chain around the handles of the main door of Hamilton Hall and 250 students massed at the building's steps. Leaders of the group said the students would not leave until Columbia's board of trustees issued a statement that it would divest itself of its $33 million of holdings in companies that do business in South Africa.   Access to the building, which is on the east side of the campus's graceful quadrangle, was possible through a subterranean passageway, but many professors canceled classes in the building. The building, which was occupied by students in a 1968 protest, contains the offices of many of the university's administrators, though many were able to work throughout the demonstration."

And they understood unmarried American women to be called Joan, while married women are named Joanson.   Citizens of both countries can laugh about that kind of misinformation today. But misinformation of more insidious nature continues to circulate in both countries about the reasons for Japan's trade surpluses.

Now, in these same reaches where Briton once fought Afrikaner for control of Africa's wealthiest mineral deposits, a different war is shaping up, one in which the nation's white mining barons face an emergent and increasingly powerful black mining union.   It is a fight, some people assert, that will be more telling in its impact than the confrontations that have blazed in the black townships since last September, for it has assumed the proportions of a crusade against bastions of apartheid that once helped entrench the power of mineowners.      Paradox for Employers    A paradox is that the employers seem to acknowledge that eventually it will be more fruitful to deal with centralized labor unions, even though those labor organizations have cast themselves as the vanguard of a political struggle against white rule. This struggle, unlike its counterpart among the disaffected youth of the townships, may reinforce its aspirations with the power of economic veto over a critical industry."

In the pubs and narrow brick homes of a city that has already been brought to its knees by fleeing industries and unemployment, these new emotions are especially hard to bear. For a long time, Liverpudlians have been living on pride.   Their two soccer clubs, Liverpool and Everton, were both champions this year. Everton, the League Cup winner in England, played five matches on the Continent on its way to winning the European Cup Winner's Cup.

Simpson and a handful of other athletes commanded the celebrity status to sell products just by saying they used them. But the physical fitness mania sweeping the country has made numerous corporations anxious to include athletics - and thus athletes - in their advertising campaigns. Thus, a growing number of amateur athletes can now be seen hyping McDonald's hamburgers, mugging for Vidal Sassoon's latest styling mousse, and generally plugging products that have little to do with the sport they play.   None of the newcomers are commanding the type of fees that Mr. Namath or other superstars get. But they earn enough to provide lucrative percentages for the agents responsible for honing their images, negotiating their contracts, even managing their finances.   The result is that sports marketing - a somewhat misleading term coined by industry officials to describe a business that promotes individual athletes rather than the sports they play - has, by some estimates, mushroomed into a sophisticated, $10 billion industry."

In a long policy speech timed for the start of Congressional hearings on 20 bills involving South Africa, Mr. Shultz said the measures were ''well intentioned'' but would have the counterproductive effect of reducing American influence on South African policy and would not help South Africa's blacks.   ''The only course consistent with American values is to engage ourselves as a force for constructive, peaceful change,'' he said in a speech to the National Press Club. ''It is not our business to cheer on, from the sidelines, the forces of polarization that could erupt in a race war; it is not our job to exacerbate hardship, which could lead to the same result.''"

The takeover spotlight swung suddenly from the oil and natural gas pipeline industries to health care - the province of hospital beds, disposable syringes and nursing homes.    Triggering this conjecture was the proposed merger of the Hospital Corporation of America, the nation's largest hospital management company, and the American Hospital Supply Corporation, the largest distributor of hospital supplies.   ''The real driving force to this merger is the balance sheet - not the earnings,'' Todd Richter, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company, said yesterday. ''After the merger, the surviving company will have a debt-to-equity ratio of 38 percent to 62 percent. In contrast, by the end of 1985, Hospital Corporation would have had a ratio of 56 percent to 44 percent. Moreover, the combined company will have $1 billion a year in cash flow and this means that Hospital Corporation can accelerate its trend of acquiring not-for-profit hospitals.''"

Many such trusts, particularly the mortgage trusts that concentrated on financing existing or developing property, had to borrow at higher interest rates than they earned when the prime lending rate soared. As a result, their share prices plummeted.   Conditions in the industry have changed, and the emphasis now is on equity trusts that own investment-grade income-producing property such as office buildings and shopping centers. But increasing attention is being focused on a version of the trusts called finite-life real estate investment trusts. These are abbreviated FREIT's and pronounced ''freets.''"

The so-called country-of-origin rule was designed to close gaps in the Multifiber Arrangement, an international treaty governing more than 80 percent of the world's trade in cotton, wool and synthetic fibers. The change aims to prevent a country that had already filled its export quotas, such as China, from shipping goods through another country with unfilled quotas, such as Hong Kong.   Under the rule, which was promulgated in August but did not become final until April 4, the United States will consider the exporting country to be the one in which the last ''substantial'' transformation of apparel made in more than one country takes place."

Venerable banks caught laundering money. A securities firm found fraudulently kiting checks. Once-respected businessmen and former government officials indicted - and jailed - for insider trading and fraud.   A corporate crime wave appears to be exploding across the nation. Not since the mid-1970's, when a series of foreign corporate bribes and illegal political contributions shocked the body politic, have there been so many deep gashes in corporate America's moral armor. The general public seems certain of the reason:There's only a fine line between business executive and crook, they say (see accompanying story). But academics, executives and government officials are still trying to figure out what, exactly, is going on orhow to stop it.   ''These are the kinds of crimes that clearly involve a matter of choice,'' said D. Lowell Jensen, Deputy Attorney General of the United States. ''These are cold, calculated crimes. It's not as though these are crimes of passion.''"

''I am here today to tell you that the mainstream of American business is on your side,'' said John M. Richman of Dart & Kraft, the first of the corporate officers to testify before the House Ways and Means Committee. ''We, too, want tax reform.'' Mr. Richman and the five other executives, who were selected by the committee because of their support for the Reagan plan, represent the kinds of companies - food, retailing and household products - that can take relatively little advantage of tax preferences allowed under current law and thus pay high taxes now. Most such companies would be helped significantly by the President's plan to reduce the corporate tax rate to 33 percent from 46 percent."

Hardly was the ink dry before it announced an ambitious restructuring of its pension fund assets that will provide nearly $1 billion to finance corporate expansion. And then, after finally fighting through a costly pilots' strike, this week it announced the purchase of the Hertz Corporation, a company that many saw as a natural extension of the company's travel business.   To many outsiders, those moves seemed to represent the imaginative expansion of a company that is already the country's biggest airline. But to some in the business, they suggested that the company might be placing the wrong bet, putting it in danger of being overtaken in the skies by another major carrier, American Airlines. While United has been engaged in its diverse expansion moves, American has been busy lining up new aircraft and generally consolidating its position as a domestic airline.   Such concerns are not without merit. Even Richard J. Ferris, the chairman, president and chief executive of UAL Inc., which owns United Airlines, acknowledges the importance of a solid and expanding domestic system. He has said that the airline was ''adding all the lift it could digest'' and has promised further expansion. ''We will be adding to our domestic fleet,'' he said."

Alarmed by such heavy dependence on foreign suppliers, President Jimmy Carter started a program of price decontrol and other steps that he said would guarantee that the 1977 import level would never be exceeded.   Higher prices, combined with recession, worked to produce a spectacular decline - far steeper and faster than anyone expected. This year imports are running at well under 4 million barrels a day and few people worry any longer about America's energy security. The Reagan Administration, in fact, now proposes to save money by suspending further purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - a stockpile of oil intended to be drawn upon in an emergency."

Mr. Rock's instinct for spotting high-tech winners such as Apple Computer and Intel has netted him returns that on occasion run hundreds of times his original investment. By contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average, despite its recent record-breaking surge, is only modestly above its June 1983 level of 1,280.   Until recently, the venture capital game has been largely reserved for huge financial institutions or multimillionaires such as Mr. Rock. Increasingly, however, smaller investors are joining in. For only about $3, for instance, individuals can purchase a share in the Biotech Capital Corporation, one of a number of publicly traded venture capital funds. For $5,000, investors can share in venture capital partnerships run by such financial supermarkets as Merrill Lynch or Prudential-Bache."

A boy was crushed to death in Birmingham, hundreds of fans and police have been injured, and the police in York confiscated knives, razor blades, a spike, and chains.   Last week, in sentencing 25 Cambridge United fans to prison, a judge condemned ''an evil, wicked vortex of violence,'' in which one fan last year had his throat cut with a broken milk bottle and a policeman was kicked in the back as he tried to ward off 30 youths from an unconscious Chelsea supporter.   Fans, the Government, and the police have felt for months that something must be done. One of the recommendations here had been to fence off soccer fields from spectators who have invaded the playing field to attack other fans and the police. The Bradford fire on May 11, in which 53 fans were killed and 200 injured, raised serious questions about this approach. Far more people would have died, it was agreed afterwards, if most of the crowd had not been able to escape onto the field."

That was the smallest growth since the recovery began in late 1982 and was far below the 4.3 percent rate of the final 1984 quarter.    According to most economists, the report dashed hopes that the United States could achieve the Reagan Administration's 3.9 percent growth target for 1985. One of the implications is an adverse effect on the Federal budget deficit because lower economic activity, among other things, implies lower incomes, profits and Treasury revenues."

The experts, including scholars and former intelligence officials, contend that the decision by the Government to trade 1,150 Palestinians for 3 Israeli soldiers has negated Israeli assertions that it will never negotiate with terrorists. They also contend that it will, in the long run, encourage Arabs to risk attacking Israeli targets.  The first casualties of the exchange, the experts say, were Israel's moral arguments in the fight against terrorism.  ''I am disgusted,'' said Shlomo Gazit, a former Chief of Military Intelligence and one of Israel's top counterterror strategists."

Vigor,"  THE just-released ''flash'' report of the gross national product, showing that the economy has moved up at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the second quarter, said to the markets that there is life in the expansion yet.   ''The surprise in the new figures,'' said Robert Ortner, chief economist of the Commerce Department, ''was on the upside.'' Most market analysts and economists had been expecting real G.N.P. to come in at a rate closer to that of the first quarter, which the Commerce Department revised downward to a mere three-tenths of 1 percent - next to nothing.   The flash report is really a projection for the quarter as a whole, based on preliminary data for April and part of May, and will undergo three later revisions. On balance, however, Mr. Ortner finds the first G.N.P. report ''reasonable.''"

It would repurchase six million of its shares, or slightly more than a third of the company, for cash and debt valued at $100 a share.    The proposal is seen by Wall Street analysts as an attempt to head off a proxy fight at the annual meeting next month, when a dissident group headed by Coniston Partners has vowed to take control of the company.   But Augustus K. Oliver, a general partner with Coniston, said that the recapitalization proposal was inadequate and that his group would continue with its plans to seize control of the cable operator."

Raymond T. Dalio, president of Bridgewater Associates, an economic consulting firm, predicts a merchandise trade deficit of over $12 billion for March, a bit higher than February's $11.5 billion.   But more worrisome, said Mr. Dalio, is a link between the trade deficit and possible moves by the Federal Reserve Board to take the economy out of the doldrums. ''What makes the rising merchandise trade deficit particularly disturbing,'' he said, ''is that the inflow of less- expensive foreign goods is encouraging consumers to take on enormous installment debt burdens.''"

The lawyer, Salvador Antonio Ibarra, said that another defense lawyer had pressed him not to contradict a statement that ''the possibility of a cover-up had been thoroughly investigated'' and rejected. Mr. Ibarra said that declaration was ''an outright lie'' and added that he was specifically warned not to pursue the case on his own.   After it became clear he would not cooperate fully in the plan, Mr. Ibarra said in an interview, he was abducted by Salvadoran security forces, held prisoner at National Guard headquarters and tortured. The objective, he said, was to get him off the case, either by killing him or forcing him to flee the country."

On the one hand, many Ghanaians who stayed resent the 300,000 or so compatriots who took their quest for riches elsewhere, as their country struggled toward economic recovery.

In two 8-to-1 decisions, the Court endorsed the long-held position of the Securities and Exchange Commission that the antifraud provisions of the securities laws protected the purchasers of stock regardless of the underlying ''economic reality'' of the transaction.   The Court rejected the so-called sale of business doctrine, a judicially created exemption to the securities laws that had been adopted by a number of lower Federal courts, although not by Congress. Under this doctrine, a sale of stock resulting in the transfer of control of a business is viewed as a commercial or entrepreneurial venture, and not a typical ''passive'' investment of the sort that the securities laws were intended to cover."

Gromyko decided that a heart-to-heart talk might break through a deadlock that had persisted between them.   Taking aside the man who was to become the Soviet Foreign Minister, the American, Frederick Osborn, spoke of his sincere desire to find a solution, and said he was sure Mr. Gromyko also believed in his sincerity.   After looking quietly at him for a moment, Mr. Gromyko replied, ''Mr. Osborn, you may be sincere, but governments are never sincere.''   In the arms talks that resume Thursday in Geneva, Americans are dealing with some of the hardest bargainers, an unsentimental breed of men who honor strength and in whose language the word ''compromise'' carries overtones of capitulation.   A body of literature on Russian negotiating techniques that dates back to the early 18th-century days of Peter the Great - when a delegation smashed its hosts' furniture to demonstrate its independence - reads like a cautionary tale against those who hope sincerity and reasonableness will bring accords."

They are particularly concerned that many investors will race to lock in tax deductions by pouring money into certain investments before the tax benefits are taken away by Congress.   Part of the fear among tax accountants is that promoters of tax shelters and other tax-oriented investment deals will use the opportunity to bring out a flood of programs, many of which will be of questionable economic merit.      'A Lot of Bad Deals'   ''There's going to be a lot of bad deals around,'' said Arthur S. Hoffman, a tax partner at the accounting firm of Oppenheim, Appel, Dixon & Company. ''If there is this window of opportunity prior to a new law coming into effect, investors are going to have to be very wary and on the outlook for quality. They're going to be induced to do it in haste and that is most unfortunate,'' he added. ''But the investor has to overcome the attraction of the tax break and take a close look at the quality of that investment.''"

Government Securities Inc.,  which provoked the subsequent run on Ohio's privately insured savings institutions, and Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Inc. have prompted calls for Federal regulation of all government securities dealers. While some regulation of unsupervised dealers may be needed, new rules should be enacted with care and not based on any of the misconceptions about the government securities market that are so abundant today.  One misconception is that, short of comprehensive regulation, investors have no reliable way of distinguishing reputable government securities dealers from the unscrupulous. Even comprehensive regulation is no guarantee of reputable behavior and cannot replace an investor's careful credit inquiries. Moreover, investors already have an extremely reliable source of information about certain government securities dealers - the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."

The good news is that sales are up in every sector of the market, from dyed rabbit coats selling for a few hundred dollars to Russian sable coats retailing for $100,000, as more and more secretaries and middle-income women find it financially possible and morally acceptable to buy themselves furs. Moreover, the social disapproval once garnered by anyone wearing animal pelts is now felt only by those wearing the skins of endangered species. ''Wearing a farm-bred fur has become as socially innocuous as eating a hamburger at McDonald's,'' said fur industry analyst Edward B. Keaney of Burns, Pauli & Company in St. Louis.    This year, retail fur sales in the United States are expected to total more than $1.5 billion, up nearly 50 percent from 1981, and more than three times the total in 1974. First- time fur buyers are younger than ever - about 26 years old - compared to an average of about 40 in the early 1970's. For producers and retailers that means greater potential for more sales now, and trade-ups to higher-priced furs as the population ages."

Such a move, a Reagan Administration official said, could be the first step toward resolving the crisis, if it was followed promptly by an Israeli decision to free 735 detainees whose release has been the main condition set by the hijackers for freeing the Americans.   In Israel, a special meeting of top Cabinet members stirred speculation that Mr. Berri's offer was being discussed.

As prices have risen, losses have widened for these bears.   Some of the ''shorts'' have scrambled to close out positions, while others have hung on doggedly, praying for a break in prices. But if prices stay firm, or head up, a classic squeeze may develop: As short sellers rush to close their losing and dangerous positions - theoretically there is no ''upside'' limit on potential losses - their buying lifts prices, making escape even costlier. That happened in the fall of 1978 in the gambling stocks. A squeeze on short sellers in Resorts International then led to a spectacular blow off, as the stock price leaped in a few months from about $20 to $210.   More modest squeezes foiled bears early this year in issues such as Valero Energy, which had been touted as a candidate for distress but enjoyed an abrupt recovery. Its stock recently sold near $13, more than double its January low. One short seller who finally bailed out lamented: ''I saw a $60,000 profit turn into a $20,000 loss.''"

The divisions were evident in Munich last week, where the Geneva-based Institute for Research and Information on Multinationals and The Financial Times conducted the most recent of a string of conferences catering to the fears in Europe about its lagging performance in comparison with the United States and Japan in developing new industries based on modern technology.   The views expressed there and elsewhere in the Star Wars debate reflect broad concerns about European technology development.

The market was also hurt by the Federal Reserve's report that the money supply has been growing far faster than its hoped-for expansion rate."

The list of winners is long and ranges from a substantial cross-section of corporate America to low-tax states spanning the Sun Belt, and from sole proprietors and professionals at the top of the income spectrum to individuals living below the poverty line.   Although lobbyists for special interests fighting to knock down provisions of the Reagan plan are currently the most visible on Capitol Hill, prospective winners are forming coalitions to rally support for it.   For instance, a coalition of 17 major companies and industry groups - ranging from the International Business Machines Corporation and the General Foods Corporation to the National Retail Merchants Association and the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors - has pledged to work for passage of the plan."

Because of the differences, CBS asked the five-member commission to hold evidenciary hearings on the transfer of licenses. Such proceedings, which can take months, are not usually held."

But few people have the time or expertise to be a developer or landlord. The solution often lies in real-estate partnerships, which have become extraordi-narily popular in recent years. A partnership lets an investor own a share of a real-estate project without the headaches of building and managing it. And the returns can be attractive, as they come in three forms: tax breaks, income from rentals and appreciation in property value.   ''Individuals across the board are beginning to look at real estate partnerships - from the people looking to put $2,000 into an Individual Retirement Account to the heavy hitters looking at private placement tax shelters,'' said Charles R. Harmon, a financial planner in Newton, Mass.   Typically, a real-estate partnership - like an oil and gas, equipment-leasing or cable-television partnership - is composed of a general partner, who oversees the program, and limited partners, who put up most of the money. The money is used to buy or build a project; for a real-estate partnership, that is typically an office building, apartment complex, shopping center or hotel, and the investors share in any profits."

Today, floundering in a sea of oil, buffeted by foreign competition, and faced with further drops in oil prices, many oil company executives are looking to the Government for protection from the ''free-market mechanism.''

A tall, trim man who had recently turned 60 emerged and took the elevator to Suite 1000, a warren of offices devoted to advancing the government interests of one of the world's most powerful arms manufacturers.   Though some senior General Dynamics officials have become familiar faces in the news during the past year of turmoil for the company, this man -even his name - has remained virtually unknown except to serious students of the case. He is Lester Crown, a company director whose 8.9 million shares of General Dynamics make him the company's biggest shareholder and who is playing an increasingly important role in shaping company strategy.   As the son of Henry Crown, the legendary Chicago financier who once bought the Empire State Building with borrowed funds and sold it for a $32 million profit, Lester Crown has gradually inherited much of his father's weight on General Dynamics' board. And in the past few months his role has expanded as his 89-year-old father's has diminished: While he does not have a hand in the day-to-day running of the company, Lester Crown is, by all accounts, deeply involved in major decisions. Recently, for example, he played a key role in choosing a successor to the company's beleaguered chief executive, David Lewis."

But for some of the human residents of this Ecuadorean archipelago, the blaze has created a modest boom.   Firefighting experts, pilots, scientists, journalists, volunteers, yachtsmen and tourists have been flocking to the Pacific islands, some to help put out the fire, some to observe the proceedings, others merely to savor the excitement. But whatever their reasons for coming, they have been spending money, and the results are visible in this dusty little fishing village.        Big Fire on Isabela Island    Sooner or later, nearly everyone who visits the Galapagos Islands ends up here, at least for a few days. Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island is not the archipelago's capital town - Baquerizo Moreno on San Cristobal Island has that distinction - nor does it command a view of the big fire on Isabela, which lies 60 miles to the west. But Puerto Ayora is where one finds soft beds, cold beer and good talk, not to mention tame tortoises, Darwin's finches and iguanas."

Then he discovered that Northern Central had, for months, been bilked by a corporate check-kiting scheme that sucked millions of dollars out its coffers before payment from checks deposited in the Hutton account had been made.   ''We were losing our shirts on their business,'' Mr. McMurtrie recalled. ''We told them, 'We cannot live with this,' but they decided to withdraw their account.''   Mr. McMurtrie's bank was by no means the only victim, as evidenced by the criminal charges and penalties that Hutton agreed to several weeks ago.

But while the repeal of the laws, announced in Parliament on Monday, was welcomed by all but the extreme right in this country, apartheid opponents said the move was largely cosmetic and did not address the lack of political rights for the 23 million blacks who constitute a 73 percent majority.

Real estate, for example, stands to lose some of its investment luster if depreciation and other real-estate tax benefits are scaled back. Tax-exempt municipal bonds would become less valuable, if personal income-tax rates were lowered, while corporate bonds, savings accounts and other fully taxable investments would become relatively more attractive. Any decision to curtail the existing preferential tax treatment of long-term capital gains would reduce the after-tax return on collectibles, precious metals and other investments whose principal return is capital appreciation.   A fundamental overhaul of the corporate income tax would have a profound influence on the investment merits of most companies and industries. Proposals to eliminate many of the tax incentives for business that now pervade the tax code and to impose a lower tax rate on corporations, if enacted, would prompt a reordering of the after-tax returns of corporate America. Companies now unable to take much advantage of tax breaks end up paying close to the statutory corporate rate of 46 percent; under the proposed changes, they would experience an increase in after-tax profits. Companies that now pay little or no tax face reduced profits."

The treaty, which has its roots in Nazi Germany's mass killing of Jews, has been accepted by 96 nations, including the Eastern European bloc led by the Soviet Union.    The Senate came close to approval of the treaty last October but did not act after a few conservative opponents threatened a filibuster. Instead the Senate voted 87 to 2 for a nonbinding resolution that supported the principles of the convention and said the Senate should act ''expeditiously'' on the treaty this session."

According to many analysts, the decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in industrial production during May provided the Fed with a motive for easing monetary policy, while the slight rise in producer prices of two-tenths of 1 percent was a comforting reminder that the central bank could stimulate the economy without reviving inflation.   The decline in industrial production was especially important, analysts said, because Fed officials have cited the problems in the manufacturing sector as a reason for easing monetary policy.      'Enough Signs of Weakness'    ''The Fed's focus is clearly on the economy and there are enough signs of weakness to warrant a move to lower rates,'' said Kathleen Cooper, senior vice president and economist at the Security Pacific National Bank."

Mr. Guzek, of Cooper Industries, is one of about 146,000 cellular phone subscribers nationwide who have signed up since 1983, when the Federal Communications Commission gave the green light to commercial cellular phone service, which held out the promise of millions of subscribers.   But the numbers have not grown as quickly as predicted. That is principally because many consumers are having second thoughts about the high rates for cellular calls, not to mention the initial cost of the equipment. And there are other problems: the providers of cellular communications - the old Bell system companies and entrepreneurs flooding the field - find they have huge start-up costs; the Japanese command a big share of equipment sales, and there are some glitches in the technology (See Box)."

But the consensus rejects the idea that the Sandinistas should be overthrown by force.   The ultimate goal is a negotiated settlement between the Sandinistas and their foes, known as contras.

Struggle With Trade Issue    But those questions intruded little upon the economic conference itself. There the national leaders, along with their finance and foreign ministers, struggled most with the question of world trade, which all consider vital to their growth and prosperity but disagree over how to provide for it."

The unedited videotapes of the interviews with the captives, who spoke as their airline luggage was piled up for transfer to Damasacus, had been flown to Cyprus and transmitted to a satellite, then relayed to Atlanta, where the cable service has its news headquarters.   The deceptive conventionality of that transmission - ABC, CBS and NBC have been carrying similar reports -belied the fierce competition among the networks to beat each other in getting the hijacking victims on their broadcasts.   The competition has extended so far that at least one television network, NBC, was confirming reports yesterday that it would consider flying relatives of the hostages to the meeting point, and paying for their hotel rooms, in order to interview them immediately after the hostages were reunited with their families."

The exchange adopted that prohibition in 1926, when there were few Federal or state restraints on promoters seeking substantial amounts of capital from public investors without revealing much about their credentials or plans. And, it has steadfastly maintained its equal voting rights policy over the years.

And that appears to be the general reaction to recent news surrounding the Tribune Company: Rupert Murdoch's probable move to sell two papers that compete directly with the Tribune's flagship properties, and the Tribune Company's own plan to buy the Los Angeles independent television station, KTLA-TV. Both changes could mean good sailing for the Chicago-based media giant later in the decade, say analysts, but for the shorter run, the view is a bit more cautious.  Speaking of the television purchase, Gregory C. Clark, vice president of Alliance Capital Management, a New York investment management firm that owns 1.3 million Tribune Company shares for its clients, said: ''I think it's an intelligent long-term move.'' But like many analysts, Mr. Clark thinks the price the Tribune paid to a group of private investors for the Los Angeles station may be a bit steep. In fact, the purchase price - $510 million - is the largest ever for a single TV station."

He said he knew Wolfgang Gerhard, the man whose identity Dr. Mengele is said to have assumed in Brazil, as well as Gitta and Geza Stammer and Wolfram and Liselotte Bossert, who purportedly harbored Dr. Mengele in Brazil over the years. ''Of course I knew all of them,'' he acknowledged, with a hint of pride."

Recently, growing concern about plastic pollution and its resistance to decay has renewed the debate over whether the use of degradable plastics -those that readily decay - should be required. The issue has attracted global concern, as shown by the decision of the Italian Government in January to ban all nondegradable plastic bags by 1991."

Anderson;   JAPAN'S TOP U.S. LOBBYIST,"  STANTON D. ANDERSON'S Sunday school teacher was a state senator who taught the boy more than Bible studies: Mark O. Hatfield, now Republican Senator from Oregon, instilled in the youngster a taste - and a skill - for politics that never disappeared. And today the 44-year-old Mr. Anderson wields political power of a sort that would have seemed inconceivable to a Baptist minister's son growing up in Salem, Ore., during World War II.   By all accounts, Mr. Anderson is Japan's most influential lobbyist in Washington, a leading figure in what is the capital's biggest growth industry: Japanese Government and industry representation.   ''You can measure a good lobbyist by the ripples he doesn't make, and Stan doesn't make ripples,'' said one of his adversaries, Travis Marshall, chief lobbyist for Motorola, an American telecommunications company that has been campaigning for an import surcharge to help redress the growing trade deficit.   Mr. Anderson, whose lean, 6-foot 4-inch frame has been a fixture in Washington for about 20 years, prefers to operate with low visibility, wielding his considerable power behind the scenes. He shuns the word lobbying, preferring to call what he does ''trade-policy legal work.'' In Japan, ''lobbyist'' carries a pejorative connotation: The word means ''action behind the curtains.''"

In a move aimed both at streamlining Apple and moving it out of the shadow of its co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, the company announced a corporate restructuring that does away with its two separate product divisions, in favor of manufacturing and marketing divisions responsible for all Apple products.   The restructuring eliminates the day-to-day operating responsibilities of Mr. Jobs, who had been general manager of the Macintosh division. Mr. Jobs will remain only as chairman of the board, and will take what the company called a ''more global role'' in product development and strategy formulation.   Apple insiders and analysts saw the move as an urgent attempt by John Sculley, president and chief executive, to assert leadership at a time when the company is beset with numerous problems. There is a growing feeling on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley that Mr. Sculley, who was recruited two years ago from Pepsico Inc., must act soon to turn the company around."

They say he spent his days at secluded farms and simple cottages, tended sick animals, disparaged black people, kept a diary but never publicly discussed history or politics, and liked to watch ''Disneyland'' on television.

By John D. Spooner. 258 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $15.95.   EVERY now and again something stands out. Sometimes it is a tantalizing ad, sometimes a lapel pin. But more often than not it is one of those proclamations about the potential for easy money. In other words, how to make it big in the stock market, and make it fast. It is a fact that library bookshelves are laden with volumes that purport to offer the sound and secret wisdom of financial investment experts. It is also a fact that many of those books fail to deliver on any of their promises. So what could possibly be intriguing about yet another Wall Street book, even with a title such as ''Sex and Money''? Yet the book begins with a disclaimer: ''But you should pay attention. The lessons you may learn here are as real as your losses all these years in the stock market.''"

Still others, who were accused of committing crimes in the United States, have been sent to prison, he said.   United States officials here said they had not been physically monitoring the return of the refugees, which will eventually reach the rate of 100 a month. But they said that they believed it was ''going very well'' and that they had no reason to suspect that the refugees were being mistreated."

It was four years that ago that Mr. Weill, now 52 years old, sold Shearson Loeb Rhoades, the large brokerage company he built through acquisitions over 21 years, to American Express for about $1 billion.

If your youngster does not take the steps to prevent taxes from being automatically withheld from his or her paycheck, that is what will happen - even if the summer earnings are sparse enough to be exempt from Federal income tax. Your youngster will be entitled to a refund if tax is withheld - but only after filing a tax return next April.   ''Many working kids are under the impression they must have income tax withheld,'' said Randy Bruce Blaustein of Siegel, Mendlowitz & Rich, a New York accounting firm.

Their principal support seems to lie in northern Nicaragua, where the level of fighting and the number of exiles fleeing to Honduras appear to indicate that something close to civil war is being waged.

Mr. Rabin, as you have heard, CBS News is reporting that in your Cabinet session this morning Israel decided to release 31 of the Shiite prisoners. Can you confirm this?   A. Yes. We are going to release them tomorrow morning. Q. Why did you make this decision? A. Well, look, our policy vis-a-vis the Lebanese detainees, was and is to keep them as long as we are going to complete our withdrawal from Lebanon, but mainly in relation to the development of the security situation in southern Lebanon. In addition to that, we are bound by the Israeli law. And in accordance to the Israeli law, every detainee can appeal to a special committee, which is headed by a district judge. And these people appealed, some of them. Some of them, we came to the conclusion that we'll not be able to convince the committee, and, therefore, we decided to release. They are not the first to be released this way. Since we've brought them, from April, we've released eight before, or even more than that, as a result of the legal procedure in accordance to the Israeli law. Therefore, it is not linked whatsoever to the problem that the United States, Israel, and the whole world are facing today in regards to the hostages in Beirut."

As an example of how a family's quest for privacy can pervade a company, Mr. McLoughlin, at a meeting Friday, cited the fact that the elegantly appointed board room at the Pleasantville, N.Y., headquarters had been traditionally locked up and unused between board meetings. Now, Mr. Grune has ordered the doors opened and has invited the work force to enter and look in if they are in the area."

Nowhere is this more true than in word processing. Most people do not need - and never use if they have them - 90 percent of the fancy features offered by the so-called powerful word processors. This has led to an explosive growth in the sales of such meat-and-potatoes packages as PFS:Write and its clone, the I.B.M. Writing Assistant.   However, no sooner has one become comfortable with a low-end word processing program than a need suddenly arises for, say, footnotes, a two-column-page format or some other feature that is beyond the software's capabilities. Does the average individual then go out and purchase a more complex word processing package for the occasion? Rarely, would be my guess.  It's far easier to reshape the processed words to the required format by, say, putting the footnotes together on a back page and substituting numbers in brackets for the proper superscripts. Printing out narrow columns and pasting pairs of them together on a single page for photocopying produces an adequate, if fudged, two-column layout. Such simple expediencies, while not elegant, suffice for the occasional exception to straight word processing."

E. Rhoads & Sons Inc., of Delaware, established in 1702. When President Washington wanted a gift for the Marquis de Lafayette he chose Number Six cologne, a scent still on sale at the nation's oldest apothecary, Caswell-Massey Company (1752), then of Newport, R.I.   In a nation stirred by entrepreneurship, where 90 percent of start-up businesses fail within their first decade of existence, there are still almost 40 venerable companies that have operated since the time of the Revolution and the first Fourth of July. Some of these have scarcely changed in over two centuries: The nation's oldest undertaking concern, Kirk & Nice Inc. (1761), built coffins for the soldiers that were killed when George Washington lost the Battle of Germantown in 1777; today, a Kirk scion operates the funeral home on its original site near Philadelphia.   Other companies loosened their family ties decades ago and evolved to match their changing markets. The Dexter Corporation (1767) in Windsor Locks, Conn., the oldest company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, started as a sawmill; now it makes specialty products for the aerospace, biotechnology and electronics industries."

''We have to try to invent weapons other than swords, so we can stay two or three years ahead of them.''   Despite the current scramble by the American auto companies to reduce Japan's advantage of $2,000 or more a car in production costs through such efforts as the Saturn Corporation, the subsidiary set up by the General Motors Corporation to make a new subcompact car, Audi officials maintain that Japan's fine-tuning of its assembly lines and the rise of low-cost manufacturing countries such as South Korea will make it impossible to ever close the gap. The solution for specialty manufacturers, they say, is innovation."

Some of them do not hide their bitterness toward the United States Government and news organizations, which they say have ignored the earlier kidnap victims or at least not done everything possible to obtain their release.   And while some prefer not to speak out on the complex issue, others openly express concern that any military action would be detrimental not only to the hostages but to all American residents in the area.   ''We feel the Reagan Administration hasn't done what it could have on our cases and we're disappointed in the media too,'' said Andrew Mihelich, a nephew who has been the spokesman for the family of the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest kidnapped Jan. 8. Mr. Mihelich, who is College Administrator at Joliet College in Jolet, Illinois, said the hostage problem should be treated as ''an entire issue'' and not as two separate cases."

President Fernando Belaunde Terry had not only suspended most payments on the $13.5 billion debt and repeatedly ignored the International Monetary Fund, but he was also spending heavily in a rush to complete a series of pet development projects.   Yet while Peru's financial situation deteriorated steadily, with interest arrears now exceeding $600 million, there was confidence that a new Government would have an I.M.F. ''adjustment'' program and a long-term debt rescheduling in place before the end of 1985.   In the past few weeks, however, that confidence has been shaken. Alan Garcia Perez, the 35-year-old Social Democrat who became President-elect on April 14, has already begun criticizing the I.M.F., raising the specter of a continuing confrontation between Peru and its creditors."

The immigration agreement, the first major agreement between the two countries in seven years, provided for the return to Cuba of nearly 3,000 Cubans with histories of crime or mental illness and the acceptance by the United States of up to 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year.      Reagan Statement Broadcast    The United States also agreed to accept about 3,000 political prisoners who had been released from jails some years ago. The Cuban Government's action today appeared to bring these procedures to a halt."

Norway has been considered an oil-price leader since it cut prices last October, initiating a important round of declines. Its latest cut by Statoil, reported by industry sources over the weekend, lowers its North Sea crude by up to $1 a barrel, to about $26.50 for June deliveries.   ''This Norwegian development reflects what has been going on in the market for five weeks,'' said Philip L. Dodge, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

The Vatican Council declaration, ''Nostra Aetate,'' or ''In Our Time,'' in 1965 rejected the once widely held Christian view that the Jewish people were responsible for the death of Christ.   At the conference, the document was repeatedly hailed by both Catholic and Jewish leaders.

Romeu Tuma, the Federal police chief in Sao Paulo, stopped short of saying that the experts were convinced that the bones unearthed in a suburban cemetery June 6 were in fact those of the fugitive death camp doctor. But he left little doubt that the forensic tests were backing up previous testimony of witnesses who said that Dr. Mengele drowned at a nearby beach in 1979 and was buried under another name in the cemetery at Embu.   A test of the age of the skeleton - Dr. Mengele would have been almost 68 when he died - ''seems to be positive,'' Mr. Tuma said. ''What's missing are three or four more tests.''"

To supply parts for a seemingly insatiable computer industry, giants like Texas Instruments and Mostek raced to retool their plants for a new generation of memory chips. And three Silicon Valley stalwarts, National Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, spent hundreds of millions of dollars adding plant capacity - sure of a quick payback.   This summer, in hindsight, those grand expansion plans look like they were assembled by brash river explorers who discover too late that the noise ahead is Niagara Falls. The industry's strategy of overcoming Japanese competition with a combination of new technology and greater manufacturing muscle has gone dramatically awry. A huge flow of Japanese-made chips, combined with slow computer sales and wild price cutting from Japan, have plunged American semiconductor makers into their deepest slump ever. More importantly, the downturn has brought permanent damage to one of the few manufacturing industries whose rapid growth had raised hopes of supplanting the declining rust industries."

The surprising 1.9 percent drop in March retail sales announced last week has forecasters saying that this Thursday's report on the gross national product will show an economy expanding at a modest real annual rate of about 2 percent. That's roughly what the ''flash'' G.N.P. released in March reported; but most analysts then said the figure would be revised sharply upward this month.  Looking beyond retail sales - which may have been depressed by the delayed mailing of income tax refunds and which are expected to rebound smartly next month - many analysts see key sectors that are not participating in the expansion.    ''The strong dollar is one of the main reasons for the slower growth,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. Paul A. Volcker seems to have reached a similar conclusion: The Federal Reserve Board chairman said last week that growth might be difficult to sustain because of weakness in mining, manufacturing and agriculture. These industries are those most hurt by a strong dollar."

Such statements are being closely scrutinized in the publishing world for hints of how Mr. Newhouse is likely to behave when his family-owned company, Advance Publications, takes control of The New Yorker magazine. Even The New Yorker - in an unsigned article published last month - seemed to question whether the change in ownership would result in erosion of The New Yorker's 60-year tradition of editorial independence."

Five other states have thrift institutions that are insured only by a private insurance corporation: Massachusetts, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which experienced a similar crisis in March.   While banking regulators in those states asserted yesterday that their private insurers were sound, thrift institutions in at least two of them had moved to secure Federal insurance in the wake of Ohio's troubles.   The very development of the Maryland crisis reflects the new nervousness about privately insured savings. In Ohio, it took the collapse of the largest savings and loan institution covered by the insurance fund -whose losses threatened to exhaust the fund's resources - to set off a run on deposits. By contrast, Maryland depositors pulled out their savings without any indication that reported irregularities at the Old Court Savings and Loan Association in Baltimore would result in losses that might threaten the insurance fund."

And while the company is still a long way from seeing the full financial impact of its drug, called minoxidil, Upjohn may already be realizing considerable benefits from the cottage industry that has grown up around the compound.   Minoxidil has the approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration, but as a tablet taken to treat hypertension. Years ago, however, Upjohn scientists found that the drug promoted hair growth as a side effect. More recently, doctors have been putting patients on minoxidil not to fight hypertension, but to grow hair."

The adviser, Paul H. Nitze, said the Administration was right to rebuff the newest missile offer because it specified only missiles in Europe, without freezing missiles aimed at Japan or China from Asia."

Italian police officials said they received notice from the Paris headquarters of Interpol, the international police network, advising them that the man, who was in his mid 20's and said he was a Turkish national, was arrested by Dutch border police May 14 at a rail border crossing near the small town of Venlo, in Holland."

Harry R. Hughes thought long and hard about how to respond.   He then quickly ordered all 2,100 inmates locked in their cells, dispatched police Swat teams to guard them, and negotiated a peaceful end to the sickout.   His approach to that incident, say longtime analysts of the Maryland political scene, exemplified his style: Unflappable in a crisis, he deliberates hard before acting and then moves decisively.   ''When he makes decisions he takes his time to the point of it being agonizing,'' said Victor Cushwa, a state legislator who knows the Governor well. ''Then he stands pat to the point of stubbornness.''"

What we have seen makes unforgettably clear that no one of the rest of us can fully understand the enormity of the feelings carried by the victims of these camps.   The survivors carry a memory beyond anything that we can comprehend. The awful evil started by one man - an evil that victimized all the world with its destruction - was uniquely destructive to the millions forced into the grim abyss of these camps.

Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Kohl said:   ''I find it most regrettable that this great man, a friend of the Germans, has encountered considerable domestic difficulties because of the noble gesture he envisaged. Let me say this as a German and as the German Chancellor: I am grateful to him for the attitude he has once again demonstrated.''   He spoke in a debate that was to have reviewed the last two years of Mr. Kohl's coalition, but was dominated by the dispute over Mr. Reagan's visit."

District Judge William Gray gave no reason for his decision, which was announced Wednesday, and declined to discuss the 10-year-old case. His ruling did not refer to the breach-of-contract portion of the lawsuit but addressed only the antitrust charges, which were considered the heart of the case."

For shorter maturities, yields range from 5 1/4 percent for bonds due in 1986 to 6.90 percent in 1990, 8 percent in 1995, 8.90 percent in 2000 and 9.10 percent in 2008.   The bonds, rated Aa by Moody's and AA by Standard & Poor's, are backed by the state's gross receipts tax on the sale of electricity, natural gas, telephone and telegraph services, as well as the state's full faith and credit."

By way of comparison, the ministry might have noted that office workers in crowded Tokyo buildings often lose that much time each day just waiting for elevators. Instead, the agency observed dryly that the average United States employee had given up three hours to labor disputes and even his hard-laboring West German counterpart had lost nearly two hours.   The report drew little public attention because labor tranquillity and job dedication have long been accepted facts of Japanese life. There has not been a major walkout lasting as long as a week since public workers went out for eight days in 1975, demanding, in vain, the same right to strike that private employees enjoy but rarely exercise."

Morris, VMS's chairman and chief executive, had some advice for those who have backed away from investment in real estate until the tax picture clears.   Real estate investment is more than tax breaks and shelters, he said. There are still opportunities to ''work properties'' and make money, he added."

Mr. Turner's comments sharply contradicted arguments by CBS in its June 3 petition requesting the five commissioners to deny Mr. Turner's application to take over CBS's broadcasting licenses in connection with his $5.4 billion bid. Offering detailed financial projections for the first time, Mr. Turner said his plan to merge his company, Turner Broadcasting System Inc., with a streamlined CBS broadcasting operation would jeopardize neither the competitive position nor financial status of the CBS television network.   Mr. Turner said that his plans to sell CBS's 18 radio stations, its two radio networks, one television station and the company's publishing division would increase the diversity of information available to the public. He contended that a merger would not diminish competition either in Atlanta, where he owns a television station, WTBS, or nationally."

This year, though, a labor dispute shut down the giant distilling complex on the rolling outskirts of this town just east of Cork from the beginning of the pre-Easter religious observance in February until April 3.   The confrontation began when Distillers, which produces all Irish whisky in both the Republic and the six British-controlled counties of Northern Ireland, tried to cut down trucking costs by laying off drivers and reorganizing deliveries. The bitter drivers could not accept that a company enjoying record sales and profits needed to resort to such stringent cost cutting."

Giovanni Pandico, a confessed racketeer now giving evidence in a major trial against the Camorra, the center of organized crime in Naples, told a weekly news magazine that Pietro Musumeci, the former deputy head of Italy's military intelligence service, used organized crime channels to assure Mr. Agca his liberty in exchange for testimony implicating Soviet bloc Governments in the plot.   This explanation of why Mr. Agca is accusing Bulgaria and the Soviet Union of commissioning the murder of the Pope has been suggested before, mainly by Soviet and Bulgarian officials and leftist newspapers in Italy. But Mr. Pandico's claims are expected to have a major impact on the trial here against three Bulgarians and four Turks accused of conspiring to shoot the Pope, because it is the first time a figure with such intimate familiarity with Italian organized crime has described in detail the purported link between Mr. Agca and the underworld."

President Reagan ordered that tariffs on imported pasta be increased sharply, to try to protect the $1.3 billion-a-year domestic pasta industry from rapidly rising imports, mostly from Italy.   The United States won the Chicken War by showing that the European Economic Community was unduly subsidizing poultry exports to countries where American poultry companies were competing. The matter ended there with the United States given the right to take offsetting action against $26 million worth of European exports."

Ultimately, it could lead to a fundamental restructuring of the American banking industry.   Banking experts said the ruling could jeopardize the predominance of New York's leading banks and predicted that it would squash efforts in Congress to allow banking on a nationwide scale.   As a result of the decision, regional banks - some of them already among the largest in the country -would be allowed to expand through interstate mergers while the New York banks would remain confined to their home states.      No Room for Challenge    The major New York banks and their law firms had hoped that, even if the Court had ruled against them, the decision would have left leeway for legal maneuvering. But H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner in the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell and an authority on banking, said that, because the Court's decision was ''simplistic'' it left no room for challenge.

The woman, Gitta Stammer, 65 years old, said the man who managed her family's farm admitted he was Dr. Mengele after she confronted him in 1962 with a newspaper photograph of the Auschwitz death camp doctor.   In the five-page report on her testimony, Mrs. Stammer is also indirectly quoted as saying that she and her husband had been afraid of denouncing Dr. Mengele because ''veiled threats'' had been made by a friend of the doctor's ''that something bad might happen to her children.''"

Similar events are occurring around Britain as addiction centers, renowned since the 1960's for pioneering the use of drug prescription as a cure for heroin addiction, struggle to cope with what is increasingly viewed as a heroin epidemic.   Concern over the number of heroin addicts, which is believed to have quadrupled since 1980, has touched off a hotly debated $2.2 million governmental anti-drug campaign and investigations by two House of Commons committees.    Unofficial estimates place the number of heroin addicts in Britain at 50,000, a figure the Government acknowledges. Official statistics, based on the number of addicts registered for treatment, put the total at only 6,000, a figure that indicates an increase of 25 percent since 1984."

Many rank-and-file Catholics took the opportunity of the Pope's visit to the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium to say directly to John Paul what millions of Catholics have been saying to each other and to their priests and Bishops.   The dissent covered a wide range of issues, notably sexual issues and birth control, the desire of many women to be ordained as priests and a general wish for greater flexibility by the Pope and the Vatican.   Two facts are noteworthy about the Pope's reaction: First that he accepted the criticism serenely, showing some understanding for those who opposed him; second that he made quite clear that he intends to press ahead with his program to reassert traditional church teaching."

Foreign Ministry officials said the Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez had rejected the terrorist demands and had informed the kidnappers through their mediator, Nabih Berri, the Lebanese Justice Minister and leader of Amal, the Shiite militia.   The officials said that position could change if the Reagan Administration was to press for the release of the two to save the hostages, but they noted that the Americans also oppose concessions.   The Spanish stand appears to have dashed hopes by many in the mediation process of moderating the attitude of the hijackers by quickly meeting at least one of their demands, Spanish and foreign diplomats said. The principal demand of the hijackers who commandeered an Athens-to-Rome T.W.A. airliner Friday has been that Isreal free more than 700 Lebanese Shiites jailed in Israel."

The Soviet-manufactured Katyusha rockets hit several areas around the Sabra, Shatila and Burj al Brajneh camps in a further intensification of the violence that has gripped the Moslem part of the Lebanese capital for four days.   Militiamen of the Shiite movement Amal and defenders of the camps appeared to be locked in a fight to the finish. All efforts to arrange a truce have so far failed."

The incident occurred as a relative calm enabled the Red Cross to evacuate more wounded Palestinians from the Burj al Brajneh refugee district in southern Beirut.   Meanwhile, a senior Iranian delegation held talks here with Shiite leaders after Teheran publicly declared its opposition to Amal's campaign to disarm the Palestinians in Lebanon. The team, headed by Ayatollah Mahdi Karoubi, arrived from Damascus, where the Iranians had met with the Syrian First Vice President, Abdel Halim Khaddam. Most of the one million Shiite Moslems in Lebanon are known to look to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious leader, for guidance."

But their presence reflected the difficulty Honduras faces as it seeks to consolidate civilian rule.    Events of recent days have shaken the image of Honduras as a functioning democracy, an image the Reagan Administration has tried to cultivate. They also reflect the difficulties Washington may encounter when it tries to turn a poor and backward country like this one into an important strategic and military ally."

The betting at tracks totaled about $8.1 billion in 1984, up from $5.27 billion 10 years earlier, according to Christopher N. Scherf, director of the service bureau of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, Lake Success, L.I.   ''Betting averages about $100 a person,'' Mr. Scherf said, adding that other aspects of racing, such as track admissions and food concessions, account for $20 more from each racegoer. These figures do not include the money generated at 45 parimutuel harness racing tracks or the large amounts spent on breeding horses.   The number of thoroughbred racing tracks, Mr. Scherf said, does not change much, hovering around 100. Next week, on Wednesday, a new track called Canterbury Downs will open outside Minneapolis-St. Paul. Some thoroughbred tracks are also used for harness racing."

''The markets have been very wishy-washy,'' said one Government securities dealer, who asked not to be identified. ''We saw plenty of retail interest last week, but there was not much going on today. We have become accustomed to not getting much business done on Mondays.''"

Vermont residents who buy their cars elsewhere receive a credit against Vermont's automobile use tax for any sales tax they paid to the other state. But the credit only operates if the buyer was a Vermont resident at the time of the purchase. Newcomers must pay a tax based on 4 percent of the car's book value in order to obtain their Vermont automobile registration.

The Morgan Stanley group, said its proposal, if accepted, would be an interim step toward making at least 60 percent of Conrail's stock available to the public within five years of the date of purchase.   Morgan Stanley said the total value of its offer to the Government could be as much as $1.8 billion. The figure was based on Government receipts that might accrue from an independent Conrail as opposed to the carrier becoming a subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Corporation, which the Reagan Administration picked in February as its choice to purchase Conrail."

CURBS TAKE EFFECT,"  Consumers are likely to begin paying as much as 3 cents a gallon more for leaded gasoline this weekend, as Monday's deadline for reducing the lead content in such gasoline approaches.   Late this week Exxon, Sun, Amoco, and Mobil raised their wholesale prices for leaded gasolines in all or part of the country by 2 cents a gallon, and other oil companies are expected to soon follow. The 2-cents-a-gallon figure is widely accepted as the industry's increased cost of producing the lower-leaded gasoline. The other penny a gallon consumers may be paying represents dealers' profit.   The reduction, to five-tenths of a gram of lead per gallon, from the current standard of 1.1 grams per gallon, to be followed on Jan. 1 by a further reduction to one-tenth of a gram, represents a major step in the Federal Government's goal of eliminating lead from gasoline - and eliminating the danger it poses to human health and the environment. Leaded gasoline is used by approximately 35 percent of the nation's 164 million motorists."

With inflation rampant, homes suddenly became a ''tangible'' that could be purchased essentially for their investment value. House-buying was promoted as a hedge against inflation, and in many markets people bought for speculation above all.   Now, with inflation curbed, mortgage rates seemingly unable to break below a level of about 13 percent and such formerly overheated markets as Houston, Denver and southeastern Florida decidedly cooled, the speculative boom has subsided. ''The bloom is off the rose,'' said Arthur Wright, a housing economist at the Texas Real Estate Research Center in College Station, Tex.   But judging from comments by Mr. Wright and other housing economists, real-estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other specialists from coast to coast, the bloom has merely mellowed, and they are far from displeased about it. Traditional values in home-buying have reasserted themselves, they say, and the expectation of short-term appreciation is not as significant as it was."

The areas are warrens of cinderblock hovels set amid a few larger apartment blocks and houses in a maze of dirt lanes that have become a staging area for Shiite Moslem militancy.   It would be nearly impossible, particularly given the mobilization of heavily armed Shiite militiamen, for an outsider to determine exactly where the hostages are being held, let alone for a commando force to free them from what are presumed to be several different locations.   While the area is referred to as ''the southern suburbs,'' of Beirut, the section bears little resemblance to the image of a typical leafy American suburb. A more accurate picture is conveyed by the local phrase ''belt of misery,'' for the loop of such settlements that used to circle Beirut before Moslems and Palestinians were expelled from the Christian areas in the north and east at the beginning of the civil war in 1975-76."

In a book titled ''Group Without Boundaries,'' published last month, Dr. Heese, himself descended from a racially mixed family of the mid-1600's but now classified as white, found that such redoubtable Afrikaner lineages as those of the Bothas and the Treurnichts were built on interracial relationships between Dutch settlers and Malay slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries.   Dr. Heese, from the University of Cape Town, stressed that his research did not necessarily mean that President P. W. Botha or the right-wing white opposition leader Andries P. Treurnicht were descended from those liaisons.      Response Is Outrage    Nonetheless, publication of his book elicited outrage from some other Bothas and Treurnichts, who threatened to sue for libel. Moreover, the research added one more twist to the conundrums surrounding legislation barring interracial sex, which the authorities have now promised to repeal."

In the past year, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds have declined by more than a percentage point, to 11.75 percent. The drop in long-term tax-exempt municipal issues has not been so sharp - as of April 11, the Bond Buyer's 20-bond index stood at 9.39 percent, down from 9.97 percent a year earlier.   ''We are in a period of successively lower peaks and lower troughs for interest rates,'' said Steven J. Hueglin, a partner at Gabriel, Hueglin & Cashman, bond dealers and underwriters, ''but the ratio of yields from bonds compared with stocks strongly favors investments in the bond market.''   As long as inflation is subdued, analysts say, bonds will remain a highly attractive investment vehicle. With inflation below 5 percent a year, there is a real rate of return of roughly 5 percent on tax-free municipals."

However, the attention probably has more to do with the fact that reporters use these programs in their work - and they assume that everyone else finds them equally indispensable - rather than with the widespred implementation of word processing software. My guess is that only a small percentage of the business community that might profit from word processing actually use that software.   Using a personal computer is still a new endeavor for many people, even in the corporate environment. a recent survey conducted by the Yankee Group for Infoworld magzine indicates that although the number of personal computers in use at large companies is impressive - 25,000 at the General Motors Corporation and 10,800 at the United Technologies Corporation, for example - the percentage of those companies' employees actually using pesonal computers is fairly low - 3.6 percent at G.M. and 5.6 percent at United Technologies."

Mr. Alfonsin called on Argentines to attend the rally in the Plaza de Mayo after a nationally televised speech in which he accused unnamed ''traitors'' of planning a coup.   The call to the plaza has tremendous political overtones here, because, rather than being a symbol of democracy, such rallies are reminiscent of those staged by Juan Domingo Peron and the military rulers who followed him.   When Mr. Alfonsin's administration took office in December 1983, he promised to break from the past. His critics were also quick to point out this week that a well-attended rally would not solve the country's economic problems."

The bombing came as world attention has been centered on the hijacking drama that started last Friday when Lebanese Shiite gunmen seized a T.W.A. airliner after takeoff from Athens. But various police spokesmen declined to link the two events."

West European governments, these sources say, fear that the $26 billion missile defense research program will divert Europe's best scientists and skills to American industry, giving the United States an unassailable lead in ultramodern technologies with extensive civilian applications.   But by refusing for the moment to join the program, the French President hopes to increase support for the European space-science program that he has proposed, these sources say.   The program, called Eureka, would provide for joint European research in many of the nonmilitary areas covered by the ''Star Wars'' plan, including high-powered computers, artificial intelligence, lasers, sensors and advanced telecommunications."

The theologian, the Rev. Leonardo Boff, is a proponent of teachings known as the theology of liberation. While he has quietly accepted the one-year punishment for what was termed his doctrinal errors and deviations, the growing controversy over the Vatican's move appears to be polarizing opinions in Brazil and elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.   Some clergymen believe that, rather than restoring orthodoxy, the Vatican's move against Friar Boff may have fed a mood of rebelliousness in sectors of the church that have been critical of Pope John Paul II. The teachings invoke scriptural texts in support of a struggle for social justice and have a wide following among Christians in developing countries."

Judge A. Wallace Tashima said he believed Unocal would also prevail in its charge that the group had not adequately disclosed information about the impact on Unocal of the second stage of its acquisition plans.   The judge said he had not decided what preliminary relief, if any, would be required by his findings. A further hearing on the matter is set for today. Lawyers said that if the judge decides the case should go to trial, then he might issue an injunction against Mr. Pickens's tender offer for 36.5 percent of Unocal stock pending the outcome of the trial."

In a highly unusual move, Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve's chairman, publicly chastised Mr. Martin for the vice chairman's remarks about how to handle third-world debt. Mr. Volcker, who was in Japan, went out of his way to criticize his colleague. Calling Mr. Martin's remarks ''incomprehensible,'' Mr. Volcker telephoned his complaints to the Fed in Washington, which released them to the press.   Money market participants said Mr. Volcker had been annoyed in the past by public remarks of Board members, but had kept his criticisms private. Mr. Martin, however, is viewed as a special case. He is widely believed to aspire to the Fed chairmanship, and, as a Reagan appointee, was considered a likely candidate for the No. 1 Fed job should Mr. Volcker step down during Mr. Reagan's tenure."

After the highly publicized five-hour meeting with Mr. Brandt, a member of the West German delegation said at a news conference that Mr. Gorbachev had said he saw little hope for progress at the talks, which resume Thursday, unless the United States revises its policies.   Calling Mr. Gorbachev ''harder than some believe,'' the West German spokesman said the Soviet leader, echoing an assessment he made when the first round of talks ended on April 23, had called the discussions fruitless.   The West German spokesman, Egon Bahr, an arms expert in Mr. Brandt's opposition Social Democratic Party, said Mr. Gorbachev also said that contacts and preparations were under way for a summit meeting with President Reagan but that details had not been fixed."

Mr. Papandreou hedged in replying to two questions on issues regarding the United States that could become divisive during his second four-year term.   Asked whether he would demand the withdrawal of American military bases here when the present agreement makes this possible, the Prime Minister referred to his Government's formal interpretation of the 1983 accord given to Parliament. The interpretation stated that the accord was intended to lead to the removal of the bases but left the timing open."

Their statements at a news conference Friday underscored a growing controversy between Jewish groups and some Eastern European emigre groups over the operations of the Office of Special Investigations, a Justice Department unit set up to find Nazi war criminals in the United States and deport them.   The Eastern European emigre groups assailed the World Jewish Congress at the news conference Friday for a recent study, in which the Jewish group charged that the emigre groups' attack on the Justice Department unit was a result of anti-Semitism and was designed to shield people who took part in Nazi atrocities in Eastern Europe during World War II.   Anthony B. Mazeika, vice president of the Baltic American Freedom League, said the group sought ''solidarity with our Jewish brethren'' in pursuing war criminals by ''constitutionally correct'' procedures."

Nearly 17 years after they set off for Shaanxi province proclaiming their support for Mao Zedong, the former Red Guards returned in a mood of truculence and disillusion. Although the policy of forcing young city dwellers to settle among the peasants was abandoned more than a decade ago, hundreds of thousands of people were never given the residence permits required to come home.   Resentment can be found wherever resettlement took place, but concerns about retribution have generally stifled public protests. Instead, those separated from their families and friends have generally concentrated their efforts on working the network of influential contacts, known as guanxi, that Chinese try to develop as a means of getting favors from the bureaucracy. 20,000 Reportedly Still in Shaanxi Those who joined the protest today were the losers in this game of maneuver. As they sat beneath large red-and-white banners proclaiming their cause, a member of the group said they represented about 20,000 people still ''exiled'' in Shaanxi, out of 400,000 originally sent there from the capital in 1968. Most were in their teens or early 20's at the time, and are now approaching middle age."
