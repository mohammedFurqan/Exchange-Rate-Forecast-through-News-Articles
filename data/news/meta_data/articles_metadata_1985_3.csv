From all quarters - labor, management and the universities - there is great dissatisfaction. Some firebrands have even called for the abolition of the board and the body of labor law that it enforces.   There is no doubt that the board should improve its procedures to conform with a changed labor market and to afford the protection that Congress originally intended. Yet, the important insight of the Wagner Act of the 1930's - under which the board was established - remains: Competition in labor markets is imperfect and workers consequently should have available to them the option of union representation."

One of these investment expatriates is Richard M. Lilly, a 38-year-old securities analyst with Raymond, James & Associates Inc., a St. Petersburg, Fla., brokerage house.   ''I'm free to do the job as I feel,'' Mr. Lilly said of the latitude afforded him. ''Investment selection is not influenced by anything but opportunity.''   Mr. Lilly has had his share of clunkers. Two years ago, he was enthusiastic about the prospects for a financial software package being developed by the Computer Usage Company, a small San Francisco-based concern. But the company ran out of money before completing the package, and stock that Mr. Lilly had recommended at $13 a share sank last January to 75 cents, as Computer Usage filed under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code."

The fundamentalists were once his allies in establishing a dominant role for Damascus in Lebanon.   ''We are hoping that he will see it in his interest'' to exert pressure to free the hostages, a senior official said today.

''He's being a wartime general,'' said William V. Campbell, one of his executive vice presidents.   Such strong-handed management is a bit of a departure for Mr. Sculley, who has often given his managers wide latitude. In particular, Mr. Sculley shared so much authority with Steven P. Jobs, Apple's 30-year-old co-founder, that it was sometimes difficult to tell who was running the company - Mr. Sculley, the professional manager and marketing expert, or Mr. Jobs, the visionary entrepreneur."

But some industry officials said the storm losses would likely mean higher premiums for customers.   ''With the losses from the hurricane coming on top of an industrywide loss on underwriting business of $11.16 billion in the first half of 1985, premiums are going to keep going up,'' said Samuel Schiff, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group for the property and casualty business.

Some Israeli officials, fearing continued strife between Israeli-supported militiamen and their Shiite Moslem adversaries, were so pessimistic about the security zone's chances that they spoke of letting ''nature take its course'' and allowing the mainstream Shiite militia, Amal, to gradually assume control of the area.   But officials now say those days are over - as is the debate in the Israeli military establishment over the security zone. Israeli military officials in southern Lebanon and Tel Aviv now say the security strip has proven its worth, even though there have been car bombings almost every week.      'Fulfilling Its Function'   ''After three months in operation we can say that the security zone is fulfilling its function - even better than some of its original proponents expected,'' said Uri Lubrani, the coordinator of Lebanese affairs in the Israeli Ministry of Defense.

If the dollar declines by, say, 8 percent against the West German mark and the price of a West German stock remains the same, the stock should rise by approximately 8 percent when sold and converted into dollars, assuming all other factors remain constant.

Invariably, at his side is Charles Hernu, his Defense Minister and a close friend for more than 30 years.

Federal officials say they are concerned about the smuggling. But at the same time numerous Government officials and others involved in the arms business say that United States policies often foster illegal gunrunning. Since the Government itself sometimes makes covert arms purchases for intelligence operations abroad, some major arms traffickers get Government protection, these sources say, even though those same traffickers may at other times sell arms to enemies of the United States."

President Miguel de la Madrid, in his annual state of the nation address, rejected ''confrontation or repudiation of contracted obligations'' as a solution to the country's foreign debt problem. But he added, ''We will insist on the path of dialogue and negotiation and on the search for new formulas that satisfy, fairly and pragmatically, the real interests of the parties of the international economic system, making it clear that to pay it is necessary to grow.''   Mexico, the second-largest debtor in Latin America after Brazil, has gained high praise and credibility among foreign bankers for its performance in trying to resolve its debt problems, and it is considered a leader among Latin American countries in debt-crisis negotiations. Nevertheless, the falling price of oil has caused worries that Mexico will find itself in an economic crisis, unable to meet loan payments. [Page 29.]  $370 Billion in Latin Debt A decision by the Mexican Government that the terms imposed by the international financial community are no longer workable would be likely to complicate negotiations throughout Latin America, which as a whole owes about $370 billion to foreign banks."

In Washington's view, only the combined South Korean-United States military force deters North Korea from launching a second Korean War. Also restraining the North Koreans, they said, is the clear unwillingness of China and the Soviet Union to run the risk of a world war started by North Korea."

From all quarters - labor, management and the universities - there is great dissatisfaction. Some firebrands have even called for the abolition of the board and the body of labor law that it enforces.   There is no doubt that the board should improve its procedures to conform with a changed labor market and to afford the protection that Congress originally intended. Yet, the important insight of the Wagner Act of the 1930's - under which the board was established - remains: Competition in labor markets is imperfect and workers consequently should have available to them the option of union representation."

The classic success story of the little software engine that could concerns Visicalc, the first computerized spreadsheet, or electronic worksheet, for number crunchers. Back in the early days of personal computing, Visicalc saved Apple from the fate of being just another pretty computer in the burgeoning hobby marketplace, and turned it into a machine that business executives across the country began scooping up.  Visicalc is history now, but in a sense its publisher, Visicorp, is a phoenix reborn. It has been merged into Paladin Software, which recently released the new spreadsheet Crunch ($295 for the Macintosh from the Paladin Software Corporation, San Jose, Calif., 95134, (408) 970-7300). Paladin, one assumes, hopes that its new product will come charging out of the West to become as popular with Macintosh users as Visicalc was with Apple II buyers.  Paladin is not alone in going after the Mac's potential spreadsheet market. In fact, this market niche is suddenly beginning to fill up, although much later than predicted, with Ensemble, Excel, Jazz and a number of other competitive packages dribbling into the stores at the same time. Crunch, however, is the program that adheres most closely to the standard so pretentiously dubbed the ''Macintosh philosophy.'' Anyone who likes icons is going to love Crunch."

Here is a look at the major companies: United States Steel Corporation - Steel now accounts for only 35 percent of U.S. Steel's revenues. Most of its sales come from its Marathon Oil division, which it bought in 1982, and U.S. Steel is reported to be ready to make another big acquisition as a further counterweight to steel and oil. Analysts praise the company for the changes in its steel operations, which showed an operating profit of $85 million in the second quarter. The steel division has shrunk drastically, with 100,000 jobs eliminated and some 150 plants closed. The company lost $1.2 billion in 1983 and reported a profit last year of $493 million - helped by one-time gains from asset sales and accounting changes.   LTV Corporation - LTV became the country's second largest steel company, after U.S. Steel, with the acquisition last year of Republic Steel. LTV has the most troubled balance sheet of the major steel companies and is attempting to restructure its heavy debt. Among other moves, it put its specialty steel division on the block. The company's ace is its stake in aerospace, which is highly profitable. LTV posted a second quarter loss of $472.3 million, including a charge to permanently idle its big Aliquippa Works in Pennsylvania."

Data bases handle mailing list maintenance and similar electronic filling tasks. All of these functions can be very useful.

Conditions there can influence leasing all over the financial district. When the state decided in 1981 to vacate two million square feet of space in the center, the entire downtown market softened in anticipation. With new construction under way, the state's departure would mean additional space to be absorbed.   Much of the apprehension evaporated two weeks ago when Dean Witter Financial Services Inc. signed a lease for one million square feet on 24 of the 51 floors once occupied by the state.

The officials said the payments related primarily to manufacturing problems with the state-of-the-art circuit boards that are the nervous system of the radars used for navigation and targeting in the newest models of both aircraft.   More than $150 million has been held back from Westinghouse over the last two years because critical spare parts for the F-16 radar were delivered late or failed to meet specifications, according to Kari Fielder, a spokesman for the Air Force Contract Management division at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. The Air Force buys the radar for General Dynamics' F-16 directly from Westinghouse."

First there was the ''poison pill,'' a tactic that corporate boards of directors adopted to make it prohibitively expensive for a would-be raider to acquire control. Lately , several corporations have cooked up another way to fend off hostile bidders - they offer existing shareholders a sweet deal but exclude the predators from the party.   The latest company to use what amounts to a new, improved poison pill is Revlon Inc., the cosmetics and health care giant that is fighting a $1.8 billion, or $47.50-a-share, hostile bid from Pantry Pride Inc. Early this week, Revlon adopted a strategy that would allow all shareholders except for a hostile bidder, such as Pantry Pride, to swap their shares for debt worth a substantial premium over the current stock price if a would-be acquirer purchased 20 percent of the shares."

And last week, stocks bounded up 11 points one day and down 11 on another for no apparent reason.   The mysterious force behind the moves, it turned out, was a relatively new phenomenon on Wall Street called program trading. The term refers to programs of orders from institutional investors and other professional traders to buy or sell shares in 100 or more large companies that are a surrogate for the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks.   Such programs are often initiated by arbitrage opportunities when the current value of stocks reflected by the S.&P. 500 and the price of a stock index future on that index are out of line. An index future is a contract between two parties that allows an investor to bet on the general direction of the market over a short period of time."

''It is our ace in the hole,'' explained John Zaozirny, energy minister of Alberta, the province that has most of Canada's 1,000 billion barrels of oil in known oil-sands reserves. Some of the oil from those reserves is sold as is, but most that is extracted now is synthesized into a lighter, more conventional crude.   Mr. Zaozirny and industry officials say that even with today's eroding oil prices, many oil-sands developments, with their low cost and enormous resources, make economic sense -much more than coal gasification and oil-shale development make in the United States. With considerable governmental help still available on both the Federal and provincial level, they make even more."

But a major portion of those costs - close to 60 percent - are still borne by the patients themselves, either out-of-pocket or through extra insurance purchased privately.   Because the elderly use medical services far more frequently than the general population, choosing the best insurance to supplement Medicare - a so-called ''medigap'' policy - can have major financial implications for them and their relatives.   Shopping for a good medigap policy requires some knowledge of how Medicare itself works. The plan is available free to people over age 65 who are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits. Medicare's Part A is basically a hospitalization policy. The patient pays the first $400 in hospital charges; Medicare covers the full remaining cost of the patient's first 60 days of hospitalization. From the 61st through the 90th day, the patient contributes a co-payment of $100 a day; this rises to $200 for the 91st through the 150th day. After that, Medicare steps out and the patient is responsible."

The country, which is the fourth-largest crude producer and the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States, has twice reduced its oil prices this year and pressure on the international market may force yet another drop.   The troublesome question facing American bankers, to whom Mexico owes most of its $96 billion foreign debt, is how far oil prices can fall before Mexico finds itself in the midst of an economic crisis, unable to meet loan payments.   In February, as part of an economic recovery program, Mexico broke ranks with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for the first time and set a price of $27.75 a barrel for its Isthmus Light crude, 25 cents below the benchmark adopted by OPEC earlier in the year."

In 1957, tens of thousands of foreigners flooded the city, which took on a fairground atmosphere as Russians rushed to clasp the visitors' hands and swap coins, pins and greeting cards. It was the first taste for many of them of blue jeans, ball-point pens and, simply, friendship with outsiders."

Mr. Andries, according to accounts in the British and French press, was there to buy an inflatable dinghy that would be brought to New Zealand and used in the underwater demolition operation that on July 10 sank the Rainbow Warrior, the flagship of the environmentalist group Greenpeace.   The purchase may in retrospect have been a key point in the unraveling of a covert plan to sink the Rainbow Warrior, an operation that Le Monde asserted today was carried out by the French intelligence agency, apparently with the approval of senior French officials.   According to Le Monde's account, Mr. Andries purchased the inflatable dinghy in London so that it could not be traced to France, and he went several weeks later to New Zealand aboard a chartered yacht, the Ouvea. His detection in London by British intelligence apparently led to a search of the Ouvea by Australian and New Zealand customs officers on July 15, five days after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior. And it was during that search that the New Zealand police first established a connection between the Ouvea and the sunken Greenpeace vessel."

In an affidavit filed with the court late last week, Robert N. Kemp Jr., president of EPIC Mortgage Inc., warned that the company could lose as much as $500 million if a receiver were placed in charge of its mortgage-servicing operations. He said the threat of such a loss would force EPIC Mortgage into bankruptcy.   At a court hearing Friday, the National Bank of Washington, the First National Bank of Maryland and the Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae, petitioned Federal Judge Claude Hilton to grant a temporary restraining order against EPIC Mortgage. Fannie Mae holds more than $100 million in EPIC-originated mortgages. The two banks are trustees for holders of almost $1 billion in mortgage-backed securities sold by EPIC in the last three years.

The behind-the-scenes activity is aimed at insuring that the issue of tax revision is quickly thrust to the forefront of the Congressional and Administration agenda after Labor Day.   Although the prospects for House and Senate passage of sweeping tax overhaul legislation late this year or early next year are uncertain, the preparations that have taken place in the last two weeks - and that have been scheduled to take place in the next several weeks - are aimed at facilitating swift movement of the legislation through the House this fall while the President tries to build up public and Congressional support.   In the last two weeks, staff members of the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax bills originate, have drafted into statutory language substantial portions of the President's plan to prevent the lengthy drafting process from slowing movement of a bill through Congress.

Grosso and his wife, Carolyn, bought their five-bedroom colonial in New Jersey two years ago, they financed the property with a 13 7/8 percent, variable-rate mortgage. They recently discovered that they owed almost $4,000 more than they had originally borrowed. The mortgage had a negative amortization feature, so when rates increased, the monthly payment remained the same and the difference was added to the principal. Dismayed, the couple decided to shop for a better deal.   Now that mortgage money is comparatively plentiful and rates are down, many property owners are taking out their calculators to figure out whether it is worthwhile to renegotiate their loans. Some are saddled with mortgages of 15 percent or more that they picked up when interest rates peaked a few years ago. Others face negative amortization, potentially unlimited rate increases or other unfavorable terms that they agreed to as a trade-off for lower initial rates. Still others want to cash in on the equity they have built up over years of rising home prices."

Throughout the night, long steel arms, reaching out from the dock, have poured tens of thousands of tons of iron ore into the ship's 20 cargo hatches.   Finally, the Edwin H. Gott's huge holds are full, and it is time for Burt W. Winkel, the captain, and his 28-member crew, to begin the 1,000-mile voyage from Two Harbors, Minn., an aging iron ore port north of Duluth. For three full days, the Gott will carry the ore of Minnesota's Iron Range across the Great Lakes east and south to the steel mills of Indiana and Ohio. There is trouble at both ends of the voyage:   Closed mines and shuttered mills bear witness to rampant joblessness, to huge financial losses for hobbled industries and to foreclosed mortgages for thousands of families. But in the days at sea, such difficulties seem lightyears away.   As far as Captain Winkel is concerned, his is the best job in the withered steel industry. He navigates one of the most modern ships that ply the nation's vast inland waterways. The Gott is one of the grand 1,000-foot vessels of the Great Lakes, carrying four times the iron ore of the 600-foot ships that once ruled the inland waters."

But you don't hear that kind of talk anymore in Derby, a city whose prosperity was guaranteed for decades by big employers such as British Rail and Rolls-Royce. The rest of Britain may not have noticed because Derby's decline has not been as dramatic as Liverpool's or Newcastle's, but the city has slipped onto the debit side of Britain's divided society. It is a new recruit to The Other Britain - the one that shares little of the hustle and sheen of the southeast.   Unlike Port Talbot in Wales, Derby has escaped the grip of pervasive fatalism; people here still think things can get better. While Port Talbot represents places where once-thriving industries have crumbled, Derby is one of those places where once-labor-intensive industries have successfully automated, costing thousands of jobs. And even the optimists here do not expect enormous improvement soon."

The organizer of this year's reunion said Friday that the recent disclosure of the meeting had drawn protests and a warning from a United States Army spokesman and that the veterans would therefore cancel their traditional get-together in a cemetery in France and meet instead in a small Bavarian spa.

Mr. Freeman, who is a travel agent in South Gate, in the Los Angeles area, arranged this year's trip by 25 veterans and their wives. He said the exchange began after the brother of a 70th Division soldier who was killed in the war met the German veterans on a visit to West Germany in 1975.

No figures are available on the number of visits, and they are not part of any organized movement, although many of the rabbis know of each other's efforts. But some of the rabbis and leaders involved, most of whom are from the Reform branch of Judaism, estimate that two dozen synagogues across the country have taken part.

The conference had been summoned by Mr. Deng to entrench his open-door economic policies in the new five-year plan for 1986-90, and to replace dozens of aging leaders with middle-aged loyalists on the party's top bodies. But the session ended on a discordant note as Chen Yun, an orthodox Marxist, made a brusque speech that challenged the Deng line on agriculture, the play given to market forces in the economy, and the downgrading of ideological indoctrination.   Some Western analysts said they interpreted one section of Mr. Chen's speech as implying that the 81-year-old Mr. Deng had been too autocratic in imposing his pragmatic, profit-oriented ideas on the party, but the context for this was less clear."

Throughout downtown and in the suburbs, however, yet 16 more hotels are being built to provide the area with another 2,000 rooms.   A coming hotel glut? Or smart planning? Whatever the case, the Dallas lodging scene is a reflection of the apparent paradox in the nation's hotel industry today: Despite worrisome conditions in some key cities and little or no growth expected in overall occupancy rates this year, the industry is building or planning new hotels and motels at a faster clip than at anytime since the late 1950's.

This was the strongest gain in the index of leading indicators since January, and it inspired the White House, which this week predicted the economy would expand at a robust 5 percent rate during the second half of the year, to call it ''ringing economic news.'' In the first half of 1985 the economy grew at a 1 percent rate, far less than the Administration forecast.   Private analysts, however, regarded the latest index reading with considerably more restraint, noting that it is a volatile statistical series that has shown mixed results - seven increases and five declines - in the past 12 months. They also pointed to a fairly sharp downward revision in the index for May, which the department now says rose only one-tenth of 1 percent instead of the seven-tenths of 1 percent initially reported."

It has long been known that the central part of Mexico City, resting on a prehistoric lake bed, is particularly vulnerable to shaking. David Harlow of the United States Geological Survey, a specialist in the geology of that region, said yesterday that in previous, less violent earthquakes the city center had been shaken ''much more than surrounding areas.''   The sediment accumulation on which the city was built is believed to be from 500 to 1,000 feet deep and such material, in an earthquake, ''would shake like crazy,'' Mr. Harlow said yesterday in a telephone interview from Menlo Park, Calif."

August 1982 - The main Sikh political party, the Akali   Dal, led by Harchand Singh Longowal, begins a mass movement of civil disobedience calling for greater autonomy for the Punjab and the declaration of Amritsar as a holy city. February 1983 - Mr. Longowal, who follows the peaceful tactics of strikes and marches used by Mohandas K. Gandhi, is joined in the campaign by a militant cleric, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, whose radical followers resort to violence, killing police officers and others. October 1983 - The central Government takes over the civil administration of the Punjab in response to the protests and violence. April 1984 - The militants, said to number fewer than 1,000, engage in a campaign of terror, shooting politicians and even moderate Sikhs and killing Hindus at random; police and paramilitary forces get orders to shoot on sight."

When Mr. Richardson took over as chairman of the company earlier this summer, he became the fifth member of the Richardson family to serve in that role since 1907, when his great-grandfather, Lunsford Richardson, a North Carolina chemist, started a concern called the Vicks Family Remedies Company in Greensboro.   Stuart, who joined the company in 1971, assumed the chairmanship from his father, Smith Richardson Jr., and father and son, along with four other family members, currently sit on the company's 18-member board. Through trusts and other holdings, the 200-or-so members of the Richardson family own more than 25 percent of Richardson-Vicks's 24.5 million outstanding shares."

By all accounts, the $6.75 billion auction of 10-year notes attracted good demand from investors, which helped to spark more aggressive buying by securities dealers and other speculators. By late afternoon, when the Treasury announced that the 10 1/2 percent notes sold with an average yield of 10.60 percent, prices had already improved enough so that the 10-year issue was trading with a yield of 10.54 percent.   Prices continued to rise late in the day, so that the new notes were offered to yield 10.53 percent, well below the 10.7 percent that was estimated by some analysts a day earlier. Although the yield on 10-year notes is still higher than the 9.93 percent level of July 5, it remains well below the 11.30 percent set at the previous 10-year note auction in May."

She was walking down the stairs of her home one day when her knees inexplicably gave out. She felt a stinging pain. The symptoms worsened and it became clear that she had rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty years later, the disease is still with her.   Arthritis has been an expensive companion. Mrs. DeGrout, a prim woman with quick eyes who lives in Clifton, N.J., buys about $200 worth of medication a year. She swallows eight to ten tablets a day of Ecotrin, a coated aspirin. Each morning, she takes 5 milligrams of Prednisone, a steroid that must be prescribed by a doctor. At least once a month, she must see her physician, which typically costs her $20 to $50. Lately, she has been showing up weekly.   She has found it necessary to acquire a range of equipment to help her through the routines of daily life. She has a padded bathtub seat that cost her about $130. She spent $35 for a walker, $25 for a set of canes. She owns a reacher ($15) that she uses to scoop up things."

But beneath the surface, two Administration debates are reported under way.   A tactical debate centers on whether, as a price for Syrian help on the hostages, the United States should ignore and deny what it has described until recently as a Syrian role in terrorism.   This issue was joined this week when Mr. Reagan omitted Syria from a list of nations purportedly sponsoring terrorism and the State Department sidestepped the question of possible Syrian involvement in two suicide car bombings in southern Lebanon."

The announcement, which has been expected since the companies acknowledged in June that they were in negotiations, came in the midst of debate over a number of protectionist trade bills in Congress, many fueled by contentions that Japan's telecommunications markets have been closed to American companies.   Analysts doubted that the timing of the announcement was coincidental. The agreement was signed Sept. 12, but Hisashi Shinto, the president of Nippon Telegraph, is currently visiting the United States, arguing to both politicians and business executives that American companies that understand Japanese telecommunications needs will have little difficulty in selling goods there. Disagreement in U.S.American telecommunications experts disagree. In several recent speeches Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, has charged that Nippon Telegraph has not lived up to a 1981 agreement calling for the purchase of more American telecommunications equipment. Such purchases, he and others maintain, actually leveled off or declined in 1984, and Mr. Yeutter has suggested that the agreement may have to be ''re-evaluated.''"

The August spending gain was three times the July advance of four-tenths of 1 percent and was the biggest increase since a 1.3 percent rise in April."

We do indeed wish to take this opportunity to thank President Assad and all of the people of Syria in the part they played in gaining our freedom. We are sure, without their assistance, without their help, without their concern over our welfare, we would undoubtedly still be in Beirut with an uncertain future. So for them I give a hand.   We're well aware that the negotiations involved in securing our freedom were indeed one of a very complex nature involving many, many people. We certainly wish to have the opportunity to thank all of these people because we do have a heartfelt sense of gratitude that we wish to convey to them. So, for anyone and everyone who has prayed for us, talked for us, waited for us, hoped for us, we thank you all from the bottom of our heart. That's to you we applaud."

The Dallas market may be worse than most, largely because of the Texas oil business slowdown, but Mr. Sanford is not alone. Almost everywhere across the country, builders are finding that new homes are not selling well, so they are slowing construction of both houses and apartments. The housing market is stagnant, and a boom that seemed to be materializing early this year as mortgage rates dropped has dissipated."

The 38-year-old Mr. Greene is not alone in his high-tech approach - the big wire houses have option departments that specialize in esoteric plays similar to his - but his firm has attracted the attention of some large American and foreign investors, thanks mainly to the 20 percent returns his portfolios produced in 1983 and 1984. He warns clients not to expect returns of more than 14 to 16 percent on an annual basis. This year, in a generally bullish market, his accounts are lagging behind the indexes and are up 11 percent. Indeed, in surging markets, strategies such as Mr. Greene's will almost always underperform market indexes.  His two-year-old Stamford, Conn.-based firm manages about $100 million of client funds.

Shelter costs, which include renter and homeowner expenses, accounted for nearly three-fourths of the increase in July. Food costs edged up slightly - largely because of higher fresh vegetable prices - while prices for gasoline, clothes and household furnishings were down."

PLAN,"  Mexico has fallen out of compliance with an austerity program established by the International Monetary Fund, probably costing it more than $900 million in I.M.F. assistance and substantially complicating its relations with creditor banks around the world, financial sources said last night.   The fall from compliance - coupled with the economic demands of reconstruction after yesterday's earthquake - is a major blow to Mexico's efforts to emerge from the burden of its $96 billion foreign debt. If these difficulties discourage foreign banks from making new loans to Mexico, putting the country in a severe cash squeeze, then the Government might demand easier terms of repayment to the banks or even curtail payments.   The dual blows of the probable loss of I.M.F. money and the earthquake come at a difficult time for Mexico, as falling world oil prices have cut sharply into its export earnings. Mexican officials, including President Miguel de la Madrid, already had taken a tougher line on the debt issue in recent weeks in public speeches, asserting that new ways would have to be found to address the third world's debt problems."

Pressing his efforts for the Administration's tax-revision plan - which would reduce tax rates significantly and abolish many existing tax deductions and credits - Mr. Reagan told a crowd of mostly retired and elderly Floridians that the present system is full of loopholes, swollen with ''useless tax dodges'' and ''too complicated and utterly unfair.''   Mr. Reagan's speech today was part of his continuing campaign, marked by a trip each week, to spark support for his tax revision efforts among workers, farmers, students, the elderly and others. Privately, White House aides are concerned about the prospects of enacting a tax bill this year, partly because public opinion for it has seemed marginal and partly because a Senate vote by Dec. 31 remains uncertain."

The measure, they are confident, would reduce tax rates for individuals and corporations, increase the personal exemption allowed taxpayers and their dependents, abolish many deductions and credits and, based on the best available estimates, raise neither more nor less revenue than the present tax law.   Beyond that, there is no consensus among the more than a dozen key players interviewed last week on what will happen. Some people think the particular elements of the House bill - the rate structure and the specific deductions to be retained and repealed, for example - will closely resemble the President's proposals. Others think the bill will be vastly different from what Mr. Reagan recommended."

By a coincidence a few days later that seemed to prove her point, South Africa's currency nosedived, the authorities suspended foreign exchange and stock market dealings and the unthinkable had happened: South Africa, long able to boast a high credit rating in a continent plagued by economic disaster, had been disowned by some of those same outsiders who had helped, with investment and economic faith, to build the reputation of economic robustness.      Gas Bombs and Nervous Bankers    It was as if the nation's township violence, flaring and sputtering now for a year and with no end in sight, had come home to haunt a white elite long sheltered from it by geographic separation and personal inclination. That white elite was now confronted with the impact of the turbulence, expressed not by rocks and gasoline bombs but by nervous foreign bankers who were seemingly more worried from afar about township violence than were the whites of South Africa themselves."

Mr. Peres, they say, has been far more successful at dealing with Israel's economic problems and ending the country's involvement in Lebanon than many people had predicted when he took office last Sept. 13. It is his success in these areas that appears to have led to his new popularity.   The pollsters, consultants and other political experts say, however, that Mr. Peres has been less successful in extending to his party the personal popularity that he has gained.   They say that within his party, Labor, he has failed to bring forward the kind of new faces and new approaches that would attract more of Israel's increasingly populous Sephardic Jews."

The big exception is forest science, in which women do not major often."

Few sizable companies in any business can grow at 20 percent year after year, but the aggressive company from the suburbs of the nation's capital made fast growth its credo. Marriott's business hotels sprouted in choice suburban, airport and downtown locations and the company - and its industry - seemed to be on a never-ending growth spiral. But times have changed. The hotel market has become overbuilt and business has slackened. And feisty Marriott, which anticipated many of these changes, is now switching gears within the industry and taking its name where it has never been before.   Next month the doors officially open on the New York Marriott Marquis, a glittering $400 million atrium hotel plunked down in tawdry Times Square. Marriott is going into the convention business in a big way and will spend over $1 billion in a coast-to-coast effort to take on the heavyweight in conventions, the Hilton Hotels Corporation. The first try has not been easy: The Times Square location is not prime territory, and a new convention center nearby, which Marriott was betting on to feed guests into its 1,877-room hotel, is still in construction and far behind schedule. Marriott executives insist that the goliath New York hotel will eventually succeed, but they concede that profits are several years away."

Salomon Brothers Inc. is circulating a brochure about the private Detroit-based company to a group of major communications companies that are regarded as ''friendly, good managers and good people,'' according to the source, who asked not to be identified.   Communications companies have been hot acquisition properties recently, with prices at record levels. This puts great pressure to sell on companies such as Evening News, whose stock is widely dispersed among several generations of family owners. The company's holdings, which have been valued at between $500 million and $1 billion, include its flagship newspaper, The Detroit News; television stations in Washington, Oklahoma City, Austin, Tex., Mobile, Ala., and Tucson, Ariz.; two Detroit radio stations, and small newspapers in California and New Jersey."

The Pere David deer - named after Father Armand David, a Lazarist missionary and naturalist who toured China in the 19th century - has been extinct in China since at least 1900. But an Air France plane that arrived here Saturday from Paris brought 22 of the animals back to their native habitat.

It was then the imperial hunting park of the Manchu emperors, and any unauthorized person killing one of the animals was subject to execution. Now it is farmland worked by peasants, part of it recently enclosed to provide a breeding ground for the deer."

In black townships near this Indian Ocean port today, streets were blocked and littered with garbage and debris, put there as roadblocks by young vigilantes enforcing the boycott by searching home-bound cars and destroying any clothes or groceries bought in white shops.   White civic officials called the impact of the boycott, which is set to last for two months, ''desperately urgent'' while its black organizers - one of whom was reportedly detained briefly by the police today - said the action had resulted in a total suspension of black trade in shops owned or operated by whites.   Elsewhere, the police used tear gas in Soweto, southwest of Johannesburg, to disperse 1,000 high school students demonstrating in sympathy with victims of recent unrest east of the city, while thousands of workers in Pietermaritzburg, in Natal, were reported staying away from work to protest dismissals."

Home care is the fastest-growing slice of the nation's $400 billion health sector. The money and the customers are there and growing. Yet profit margins are squeezed by powerful forces, starting with the main payer, the Federal Government. Medicare expects to spend $2.3 billion for home health care this year, up 14.7 percent from 1984. But it is turning the screws to limit what will be paid for."

The official said the K.G.B. man, Oleg A. Gordiyevsky, feared that after more than 15 years as a double agent for Britain and the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency, his superiors had learned about his role and that on his return to Moscow he would face interrogation, probably under torture, and inevitably execution.   The official compared the Gordiyevsky case to that of Arkady Shevchenko, a senior Russian bureaucrat at the United Nations who says he supplied intelligence to the Central Intelligence Agency for 32 months. Mr. Shevchenko was also called home for consultation, and, suspecting that his espionage had been discovered, defected to the United States.   On Thursday, when Mr. Gordiyevsky's defection was announced, the British Government ordered 25 Soviet diplomats, journalists and others to leave the country, saying they had engaged in activities incompatible with their status and jobs - diplomatic parlance for spying. The Soviet Government responded Saturday by ordering 25 British diplomats, businessmen, journalists and others to leave the Soviet Union, accusing them of ''impermissible activity.''"

Britain's Ambassador here, Sir Bryan Cartledge, said that the 31 Britons ultimately ordered to leave the Soviet Union were ''innocent victims of retaliation'' against Britain's expulsion of ''31 incontrovertibly identified Soviet intelligence agents.''   In the past, when Soviet agents abroad were exposed and sent home, the Soviet Union usually reacted quietly, evidently finding it more expedient to avoid a crisis and to return to business-as-usual as soon as possible."

Foreign bankers said a 12-bank advisory committee had been encouraged by the Government's initial moves to control Peru's chaotic economic situation and was now awaiting the appointment of a debt negotiator so that a time and place for the talks can be set.   The bankers, who asked not to be identified, said they were taking a ''wait-and-see'' attitude, but some financial experts believe their very willingness to discuss Peru's conditions for restructuring its $14 billion foreign debt suggested a readiness to be flexible.

But when a visitor to his elegant Mayfair penthouse residence overlooking Hyde Park turns the discussion to his friends, his family background and the scope of the family fortune, affability fades from the face of the 53-year-old Egyptian patriarch. He rustles impatiently in the deep cushions of his chair and, although the politeness is unfailing, he becomes tense. Such questions have become the bane of Mr. al-Fayed's existence.   Last March, Mr. al-Fayed and his two younger brothers, Ali and Salah, made news when they mounted a management-supported bid for control of the House of Fraser P.L.C., acquiring the retailing empire, including its jewel, Harrods, for $842 million. This was a dream come true for the family, which built its fortune in real estate, shipping, construction and banking - first in the oil-rich countries of the Persian Gulf, then in Europe and, more recently, the United States.   Unlike many high-flying deal makers, however, Mr. al-Fayed treasures his privacy and tries to keep his family from the limelight. To the general public, the Fayeds were known, if at all, for their lavish restoration of the Ritz Hotel since acquiring it in 1979, and a major role in financing the Oscar-winning film, ''Chariots of Fire.''"

The move, which President Alan   Garcia Perez announced in his inaugural address on Sunday, is important mostly as a symbol and a precedent. For international banks, the worry is not so much that Peru might not pay its debts - it already is months in arrears - but that other, bigger debtors like Brazil or Mexico might get ideas.   No one thinks that other countries will follow Peru's lead very soon, limiting payments on foreign debt to a percentage of export earnings.

BAN IS LIFTED,  The Air Force said it had lifted a suspension on awarding contracts to the General Electric Company's missile re-entry systems operation.

Shultz Speech Much of the conflict in the world today stems from the refusal of some governments to accept the reality that the aspirations of people for democracy and freedom simply cannot be suppressed forever by force.   In South Africa, these aspirations on the part of the black majority have - as never before - drawn global attention and support. Change is inevitable. The issue is not whether apartheid is to be dismantled, but how and when. And then, what replaces it: Race war, blood bath, and new forms of injustice? Or political accommodation and racial coexistence in a just society? The outcome depends on whether and how quickly the South African Government can accept the new reality, and on whether men and women of peace on both sides can seize the opportunity before it is too late.   This much is clear: There must be negotiation among South Africans of all races on constitutional reform. True peace will come only when the Government negotiates with -rather than locks up - representative black leaders. The violence will end only when all parties begin a mutual search for a just system of governance."

The higher stake, combined with the promise of major concessions from two of the carrier's three unions, gives the Icahn group a good chance to win control of the airline, analysts said.

''I got interested because it would complete a project or vision we had in the Kennedy Administration, to put up a high-speed monorail out to Dulles,'' said Mr. Halaby, who served as head of the Federal Aviation Administration during that period. As chief of the F.A.A., Mr. Halaby was in charge of construction of the airport, which is 20 miles outside Washington."

But the analysts also said that the President's decision might have psychological effects, strengthening the resolve of other governments to expand their own sanctions. Such measures, combined with the American actions, could eventually hurt South Africa's economy, they added.   Some analysts speculated that South Africa could respond in a way that would work against President Reagan's commitment to the moment, as he put it today, ''when apartheid will be no more.'' The sanctions could encourage the country to redouble its effort to build a self-supporting economy, leaving it free to pursue its segregationist policies, these experts said."

One answer: I hope so.   The arrival and persistence of high unemployment has coincided with the rise in imports. Mr. Garten and Senator John C. Danforth (the source of Mr. Garten's question) might usefully pay less heed to economists and re-examine the assessments of both Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt as to the causes of the Great Depression."

The Cubans first went to Angola during the civil war of 1975-76 to support and insure the victory of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola against two other Angolan factions, supported variously by China, the Central Intelligence Agency and South Africa.

His resignation is widely believed by diplomats and politicians to be a tacit recognition that he has outlived his usefulness as party leader.

A stronger yen would help cut the United States trade deficit, by making Japanese imports more expensive for Americans to purchase and by making United States goods less expensive in Japan.   Japan left the Group of Five meeting with the ''understanding that the major issue is the exchange rate between the dollar and the yen,'' said a senior official at the Bank of Japan. [Monetary officials familiar with the talks also said the strengthening of the yen was a major focus of the meeting. Page D6.]  In the past, Japan has pledged certain economic steps that would have the effect of improving America's balance of trade. Japan is believed to have reiterated those pledges at the Group of Five meeting. Also, judging from action in the foreign currency markets over the past four days, Japan apparently said it would intervene heavily by purchasing yen for its central bank."

While support from the business community is not viewed as critical to move a bill out of the House tax-writing committee, whose members are now generally committed to turning out a comprehensive tax overhaul bill, their lobbying organizations are being counted on to help win passage on the House and Senate floors, where support is uncertain.   The business groups backing the Reagan plan represent a relatively small segment of the business community and their influence has been weakened by division within their ranks. Nonetheless, they have emerged as the strongest base of support thus far amid a sea of dissent from most segments of the business community and lackluster support from the general public."

Mr. Agca repeatedly altered his version of events during the 23-month investigation leading to the trial, in which eight people are accused of conspiring to kill the Pope.   Mr. Agca's explanation of how the kidnapping relates to his case contrasted with earlier testimony in which he said the abduction was engineered by the spurious Masonic lodge known as Propaganda 2, which he said knew he was Jesus Christ and sought to put him in the Vatican."

''I like him,'' the four-year-old boy told his father. ''He's very silly.''   And indeed, several generations of young readers have felt the same way. The Curious George books have sold more than four million copies over the years, according to the publisher, Houghton Mifflin. They have been so successful, in fact, that a new crop of Curious George books is coming on the market.   But the new books reflect the changing dynamics of children's book publishing as much as the popularity of the whimsical monkey. A generation of parents that prizes book-learning is now trying to expose its children to books at an earlier age. And as a result, publishers are rushing to turn out volumes geared to youngersters aged 2 to 6 - and even younger. The new Curious George books, for example, are intended for a somewhat younger readership - including children as young as 2 years - than the original books."

Sector funds, also known as specialty funds, limit their portfolios to specific market groups ranging from utilities and financial services to health care and high tech.   In recent years, specialty funds have been firmly lodged in the top spots in mutual fund rankings. For example, of the 860 mutual funds whose performances are monitored by Lipper Analytical Services, sector funds filled the top four spots for the 12-month period ending Aug. 22. The No. 1 performer was Prudential-Bache Utilities, with a rise of 50.8 percent. Next were Fidelity Select Financial (up 45.4 percent), Fidelity Select Leisure (42.7 percent) and Century Shares Trust, which specializes in insurance companies (39.6 percent). In fact, of the top 10 performers, 7 were sector funds."

BOTHA of South Africa has proposed to restore citizenship to millions of blacks who lost it when the Government set up its ''homelands'' policy, which was intended to make South Africa ultimately a white state. The pass laws controlling the movement of black labor appear likely to go next. If, as it now seems, apartheid is crumbling, what cracked it at last is the threat of economic collapse, brought on not by political pressures or sanctions but by the actions of bankers and business executives - and by the economic blunders of the South African Government.   The economic crisis has been a long time in coming. The central piece of legislation to remove blacks and control the influx of blacks into urban areas was a 1951 version of a 1936 pass law. For the first time, women as well as men were required to carry passes. Under section 10 of the bill, an African was permitted in a city for more than three days only if (a) he or she was born in that city, (b) had lived there for 15 years or worked for one employer continuously for 10 years, (c) was under 16 years of age, or (d) received special Government dispensation. A person's status could not change through marriage."

The company, based in Stamford, Conn., said it would sell or liquidate certain businesses, decommission chemical facilities that are currently on standby status and write down the value of certain facilities and assets hurt by changing economic conditions.   The company said the move, which is expected to result in a loss for the year, was a further step in its recent actions to reposition itself. Olin said it was closing and writing down the value of some chemical facilities in response to overcapacity in basic chemicals as overseas plants multiply and seek markets here."

Money market accounts, on the other hand, continued to hold firm.   The Bank Rate Monitor's national index this week showed that the average yield on a bank money market account was unchanged for the sixth consecutive week at 6.90 percent. The average yield on a six-month certificate of deposit slid two-hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.64 percent.

The company said it was not yet in talks with potential buyers of the three oil and gas units scheduled to be sold."

A modest improvement in the long-chilly relationship - marked by the signing of an immigration agreement in December and indications that some Cuban troops might be withdrawn from Angola - has been stalled, and the officials say there appears to be no hope for improvement in the near future.   The warming in the relationship, which United States officials had publicly denied, came to an abrupt halt in late May when the United States inaugurated a broadcast service to Cuba called Radio Marti. Officials in Washington said the station would provide Cubans with news about their Government that was being withheld by their leaders.   Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, denounced Radio Marti as a cynical and provocative attempt at subversion and suspended a five-month-old immigration agreement with the United States, which had been the first major accord between the two countries in seven years."

Reagan Administration and Pentagon officials have repeatedly said that the United States presence in the Central American country is maintained only on an annual basis and is designed to support military exercises.   The Defense Department and the State Department repeated those assertions today. They said the memorandum, written by Lieut. Col. Philip G. Stowell, involved ''contingency planning'' and only represented ''his perceived needs and his interpretation of assumptions and planning factors.''"

This steel, mining, and oil monolith accounts for 3 percent of Australia's gross domestic product, 5 percent of exports and 10 percent of the value of all shares listed on the nation's stock exchanges. On an Australian scale, that's rather like being U.S. Steel, Asarco and Exxon rolled into one.   Even more impressive, B.H.P. boasts remarkable profitability for a company in such distressed industries. It reported record net income of $546 million on sales of $5 billion for the fiscal year that ended May 31. Those earnings, two-thirds of which stem from highly profitable Australian oil operations, received an added lift because almost half its sales were made in strong American dollars, while most costs are paid in the much weaker Australian currency.   But the Big Australian has grown too big for Australia. Not only does it monopolize the steel industry there, but it also produces, in a joint venture with Exxon, most of the oil pumped in Australia and it is a major miner of iron ore, coal and manganese. To grow faster than the nation's economy, the century-old company has decided that it must go multinational."

Under its new chairman, Michael D. Eisner, and president, Frank G.

The projects include a $300 million production studio and tour at Disney World, near Orlando, Fla., and a 12-minute, three-dimensional film for the Disney parks starring Michael Jackson and directed by George Lucas."

Pausing just long enough to make his questioner feel a bit uncomfortable, Mr. Gromyko answered, ''Perhaps.''   When Mr. Gromyko was transferred today from the post of Foreign Minister, which he had held for 28 years, to that of President, there was nothing in his demeanor to indicate whether the move was a promotion or a demotion.   In brief acceptance remarks before the Supreme Soviet, the Parliament, he stated what might have been his credo as the survivor of six Soviet administrations: ''I will make every effort to fulfill with honor my duty toward the party and the country.''"

Moul would aggressively push his division to generate more cash so that another division could build a new plant would probably have made him laugh. But today, rather than laughing, that is exactly what Mr. Moul, the general manager of one of the American Can Company's packaging divisions, is doing.   The reason: This year, American Can introduced an incentive program that enables the 40 top managers in its packaging sector to profit from the success of the group as a whole. Mr. Moul, who now talks about acting like ''an entrepreneur'' and being ''an owner'' of the $2 billion sector, stands to share in the riches if the new plant's product, a semi-rigid bottle, is a big seller.   In industries ranging from financial services and telecommunications to food processing and high technology, more and more companies are pushing incentive pay farther and farther down their white-collar ranks in a bid to tie compensation more closely to individual and divisional performance.   Indeed, more than 100 of some 500 medium and large companies surveyed by the Hay Group, a consulting firm, said they either had begun to spread incentives to lower levels in their organizations, or planned to do so. The goal: to make the fixed salary a smaller and smaller portion of total compensation."

Mr. McFarlane said he was disappointed by the speech given on Thursday by the South African President, P. W. Botha. Despite a buildup of expectations both in the United States and South Africa, Mr. Botha pointedly did not detail any specific actions for change in South Africa.      Growing Questions on Speech    Mr. McFarlane's comments today came against a background of growing questions in the United States and South Africa as to why expectations were so high that President Botha's speech would contain major concessions to the country's black majority, and whether South African officials suggested that the speech would point in that direction.

The still unpublished ''military protocols,'' signed in Libya last week and announced in Sudanese newspapers on Monday, are ''the most significant in a series of moves aimed at easing tension between Khartoum and Tripoli,'' a senior Western diplomat. ''At the very least, it shows that the new Government here is determined to adopt a more neutral, less pro-Western stance.''   That new Government, led by Gen. Abdel Rahman Siwar el-Dahab and other military officers, came to power after the overthrow of President Gaafar al-Nimeiry three months ago. The general promptly re-established diplomatic links with Libya, in exchange for which Libya shut down an anti-Sudanese radio station and promised to stop supporting rebels in the southern Sudan."

During her childhood in East Texas, her father often told her not to take a job ''where some union goes around telling you what to do.''   But in her five years at the Texas Department of Human Services, Mrs. Mixson has become a convert to labor's cause. A program analyst in her 30's, Mrs. Mixson switched allegiances after management repeatedly ordered sweeping job changes for her and her co-workers without consulting them. ''Unions are the only way that the little people can have an effective say over rules that govern them on the job,'' she now says.   For the labor movement, signing up Mrs. Mixson was a small, but important, victory after a decade of declining union membership and particular difficulty in enlisting young people. Increasingly, union leaders are recognizing that if labor is to reverse its decline, it must woo more young workers. And to that end, American labor has embarked on a host of new strategies to attract the 52 million American workers under the age of 35, who represent half of the nation's labor force."

The Commerce Department said sales at department stores, restaurants and other retail establishments edged up four-tenths of a percent last month to a seasonally adjusted total of $113.7 billion.   The modest rise followed two months of declines, including a sharp 1.4 percent drop in June that originally had been reported last month as a less severe fall of eight-tenths of 1 percent.

Stays Put On Friday, the Government's report on the Producer Price Index - which measures changes in the prices of finished goods as they leave the factory -will show a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent for August, says John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. That is a slightly lower rate increase than the three-tenths of 1 percent for July, when there was a burst in food prices.   The P.P.I. is being held down in part by the still-strong dollar, which keeps a damper on the prices of commodities that go into the products measured by the index, Mr. Paulus said. Looking ahead, he said that producer prices would rise by only 1 percent to 1.5 percent for the entire year."

The powerful American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which once controlled all of the nation's long-distance business and 80 percent of its local telephone service, would decide its position on an issue, marshal the needed troops from its nationwide ranks, then make its point with policy makers. As far as Washington and the telephone behemoth were concerned, differences voiced by the independent telephone companies were little more than static on the line.   But now, thanks to deregulation of the telephone business and last year's breakup of A.T.&T., rampant democracy - and more than a modicum of chaos - has set in.   A.T.&T., with a Washington staff of 14 people as well as a ''field force'' of 70 people across the country, remains a potent lobbying presence. But now each of the seven regional phone companies has a Washington office of its own, with staffs ranging from 6 people to more than 30. The former Bell companies, the old line independents, the long-distance companies, and a host of other contenders for the lawmaker's ear all are making their own spirited efforts to influence telecommunications policy."

In particular, investors have snapped up shares of major drug manufacturers, whose foreign sales account for an estimated 35 to 40 percent of their total business. The Upjohn Company jumped 4 3/4 points Wednesday, and yesterday its stock hit record highs, finishing at 121 1/8, up 3/8.

As Hurricane Gloria roared up the Eastern Seaboard and through the metropolitan area, the New York markets in stocks, government securities, commodities and other financial instruments either never opened or closed by midmorning.   Faced with high absenteeism and concern among those already on the job, banks, investment houses and securities firms concluded in rapid-fire fashion to batten down the hatches and send employees home.   The government securities market opened for about an hour but closed at 10 A.M. after major securities dealers decided that absenteeism was too high. Trading in foreign currencies, which has been a major focus of the financial community this past week, suddenly was reduced in the United States. [Pages 38 and 40.]  Wall Street's shuttering, in turn, quickly rippled across the land, closing the over-the-counter market, the nation's regional stock exchanges, and the two largest futures markets in Chicago, leaving many brokerage firms elsewhere with little choice but to close for the day."

Representatives from 90 nations will be trying again to agree to begin a new trade round, the ninth since the end of World War II, during a special three-day meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the body overseeing world trade. This week's talks are critical, because they may decide whether a new trade round starts in a atmosphere of global consensus, or after a split between industrialized and developing nations.   A new international trade negotiation, which would be the first since the five-year ''Tokyo Round'' ended in 1979, is seen by the Reagan Administration and many other governments as a means of defusing explosive protectionist pressures building in the United States and elsewhere."

Now, with the world's most productive gold fields caught in the turmoil of South Africa, the Canadian moves are starting to seem shrewd.   Gold is ''the one sector in the mining area in Canada which is cooking,'' Christopher Bryan, vice president of Levesque Beaubien Inc., a Montreal securities firm, said. ''There are no long faces. Piles and piles of money are flowing into gold exploration.''   Sizable profits have also flowed into the pockets of investors in Canadian gold stocks.

Activists in the crowd said they wanted to incinerate their victim alive on the burning car for his purported crimes, but he escaped to safety after the Bishop's intervention.   The incident was one of many during a funeral on an African winter's day in this township 30 miles east of Johannesburg that brought into sharp focus the hatreds that township dwellers reserve for both the white-led police and those blacks deemed to be collaborating with the authorities.   Members of the crowd accused the black man of being a police undercover operative. The man's ''sentence'' was passed by an impromptu gathering of blacks who did not believed the man's story - that he was the son of a butcher from nearby Daveyton. His car was set on fire, an activist said, ''to provide his funeral pyre.''"

The downturn, which has occurred during the normally strong summer months, has had an impact on restaurant stocks and caused some analysts to revise their investment strategy toward the group.   The slump has come after a six-month period when restaurant stocks performed significantly better than the overall market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index. And it has hit Church's Fried Chicken Inc., the nation's No. 2 fried chicken chain, after Reynolds Industries' Kentucky Fried Chicken, especially hard."

Jews enjoy the privilege of being allowed to emigrate more or less freely, and many Rumanians are ready to pay the price of adopting an unpopular faith for that opportunity.   In the past some Rumanians, to gain greater acceptance, hid the fact that even part of their ancestry was Jewish.

In the rich cadences of his Jamaican accent, still strong after 40 years in New York City, he speaks with pride about this block and how it has been transformed over the last decade from a row of abandoned and burned-out shells to a vibrant residential strip with stores at street level.   But as Mr. Gooden approaches 144th Street, which marks the beginning of a long row of abandoned buildings on Amsterdam, his talk is tempered by a recognition of the realities: that the Federal funds that made the improvements possible are gone, and that however much is done to create affordable new housing in Harlem, the numbers are still tiny compared with the demand.   Mr. Gooden, a 59-year-old developer and Harlem resident, began in 1977 to work his way along 145th Street from Broadway east to Amsterdam, then south along Amsterdam toward 144th Street, rehabilitating city-owned abandoned apartment houses under the Federal Government's Section 8 housing subsidy program."

Mr. Reed's new appointments themselves presented few surprises, since most of the shifts had been predicted as early as last week. But the logic behind them, which Mr. Reed laid out at a news conference yesterday, provided the first real glimpse of Mr. Reed's management philosophy, which seems to be in sharp contrast to Walter B.

But the panel, in what some analysts saw was a significant change, decided that, if the supply of money began to decline, it would do nothing to keep it from falling.   The minutes indicated that the members were concerned about the continued rapid growth in M-1, the basic money supply measurement, which had expanded at a 13 3/4 percent rate in the second quarter of the year.   At the same time, as announced by Paul A. Volcker, the Fed's chairman, in his semiannual Congressional testimony on monetary policy last month, the members of the Federal Open Market Committee decided to set a new base for the growth of M-1.

In February, the Fed had set growth targets for M-1 between 4 and 7 percent for 1985."

The institutions that have imposed these fees say that the additional expense involved in hooking up to and maintaining a link with a network mandates a charge. But others believe that such switching or interchange levies, which typically range between 25 cents and $1 a transaction, are self-defeating since they tend to diminish the usage of these machines at a time when many bankers are trying to encourage more customers to restrict their personal dealings with tellers.   Automated machines - which automatically provide major banking services such as deposits, withdrawals and account status information on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week basis - first went into operation in 1967, according to the American Bankers Association. Today about 65,000 of these devices are in operation at more than 7,000 institutions, with a large percentage connected to one of the more than a hundred statewide, regional, national or international networks that allow account holders to use machines at other banks as though they were at their own."

A two-and-a-half-minute report earlier this month, including what appeared to be battlefield footage and heroic words from a group of Soviet soldiers, was a far cry from the daily, detailed and often negative reports from Vietnam that filled American television screens.   But the fact that the officially controlled television program was showing burning trucks, explosions and Soviet troops assaulting an unseen enemy raised eyebrows among Western diplomats here.   A Soviet journalist said he believed that the footage had been filmed in Afghanistan but that the battle scenes themselves were likely to have been at least partly staged for the camera."

Farm export sales have slumped. Farm asset values have continued to fall. And farm income has stagnated at levels that are unacceptably low for many farmers. As a result, farm business failures have increased sharply from the very low levels of the past two decades. Problems on the farm have spilled over into rural communities, and financial pressures on agribusinesses and farm lenders have increased markedly.  The main symptom of agriculture's problems is the financial stress on farms and ranches. In the nation's midsection, failures of farm businesses were running nearly four times the normal rate this spring, while partial farm liquidations were more than five times normal."

This might not be true, the analysts said, if the United States could devise an ''extremely capable'' shield that would protect many cities and much of America's arsenal of nuclear weapons.   But the report expressed doubt that a nearly leakproof shield was technologically feasible and argued that a highly effective defense would require that the Soviet Union agree to significant limits on its offensive nuclear force.      Threat to Arms Control Seen    The nonpartisan agency's 324-page report, commissioned by the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the current ''urgent'' effort to develop a high-technology missile defense would probably encourage the Soviet Union to increase its nuclear attack forces and could threaten both ''the entire arms control process'' and the 1972 treaty that limits defenses against intercontinental missiles.   A companion report on antisatellite weapons said that the best course for the United States would be to seek a treaty limiting the testing of such space weapons and, at the same time, to devise ways to defend American satellites from attack."

As demonstrations continued outside the South African Embassy, Randall Robinson, co-chairman of the Free South Africa Movement, said of Mr. Reagan: ''The executive order and speech were designed to help him reconcile his reflexive sympathy for the white minority government of South Africa with the building opposition to his program of constructive engagement in the United States.''"

Although the gain was slightly less than the $3 billion or so that was expected, analysts noted that money supply continues to expand far more rapidly than the Federal Reserve's targets.   Until the central bank's actions prove otherwise, many analysts expect Fed officials to guide monetary policy according to the behavior of the economy, not money supply."

Once the country seemed to provide unlimited markets for the industry to build cities, create industrial empires, win wars. The steelmakers grew comfortable and complacent, and so, after a time, did their union workers.   But Big Steel fell into distress at the end of the last decade. As it lagged in technology and as cheaper imports grew, some of the behemoths began to diversify. The United States Steel Corporation, the industry leader, bought a huge petroleum company, Marathon, and now only one-third of its revenues come from steel. Earlier, National Steel had changed its name to National Intergroup, to reflect its move into financial services and other areas. But the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, long the nation's second-largest steelmaker until the recent merger of the LTV Corporation with Republic Steel, stubbornly stayed with its core business.   The stick-with-steel strategy was all the more noticeable because it was not executed by entrenched executives but by Donald H. Trautlein, 58 years old, an accountant who spent 25 years with Price Waterhouse before joining Bethlehem as controller in 1977. He took over as chairman five years ago."

Aircal Inc., a regional airline that draws about 70 percent of its revenue from the Los Angeles-San Francisco market, hopes to win over a majority of the 6.6 million travelers who each year fly between the four Los Angeles-area airports and the San Francisco Bay area's three airports.   After three strained years, aggravated by fare cutting, that threatened to bankrupt the Newport Beach-based carrier, Aircal returned to stable prices and profitability last year. Since then it has poured millions into new Boeing 737-300 jets and a barrage of advertising aimed at unseating its rival. The company has signed a contract to lease 12 jets valued at $300 million, and it has options for 11 more."

''What came out is that the enemy of yesterday is still today's enemy,'' he said at a rally on the eve of voting for blacks Monday and Tuesday, the second stage of Zimbabwe's first general election since independence in 1980.   Mr. Mugabe said there could never be an alliance between Mr. Smith's supporters and Zimbabwe's black majority. He told up to 200,000 supporters that it would now be ''very hard going for the racists of this country.'' Mr. Smith was Prime Minister of the country when it was known as Rhodesia."

Nigeria, which is relatively flat, has rich oil and mineral deposits. Population Nigeria's population, estimated to range from 80 million to 95 million, includes some 250 tribal groups. About half the people are Moslems, primarily in the north. There are many Christians in the south. English is the official language but major African languages, such as Hausa, Yoruba and Ibo, are widely used. About 70 percent of the population is illiterate. Economy Nigeria is one of the largest suppliers of oil to the United States. It must import 70 percent of its food and raw materials. In addition to oil, which accounts for more than 90 percent of its foreign exchange, Nigeria also exports cocoa and rubber."

While rescue teams continued their search for survivors of the earthquakes that struck the city Thursday and Friday, and while burials continued, other people began to return to work.   The additional cars on the streets -combined with the many blockades in damaged areas around the city -snarled traffic into impenetrable knots. The additional volume of telephone calls resulting from renewed business activity brought the city's crippled telephone system to near collapse, with waits of 15 minutes for a dial tone not uncommon."

(6:20 A.M., New York time) and sent water sweeping through the mountain village of Stava, washing away everything in its path.   The 150-foot-wide wave of mud and water destroyed three hotels, part of a fourth and two dozen houses in one of Italy's greenest and most popular mountain resort areas."
