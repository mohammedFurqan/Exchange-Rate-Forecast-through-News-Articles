But other experts argue that a half-point cut is enough for an economy that, apart from the market, still has considerable strengths.    The debate over how far the Fed should go to reduce its benchmark interest rate -- thus influencing what lenders charge for mortgages, home equity loans and other credit -- reflects sharply different views of the stock market's effect on the economy. Many are urging the Fed to recognize that the economy now dances to the stock market, not the other way around. Others view the stock market's movements as a less important influence on the economy than factors like the level of unemployment, the value of homes and the pace of wage gains.  "

By intervening in the Northwest dispute, which he pledged to do last month, Mr. Bush becomes only the second president to order workers at a major airline to stay on the job since 1966. [Page A1.]    A federal bankruptcy judge criticized a bid by Carl C. Icahn for the assets of Trans World Airlines, and suggested a proposal by American Airlines was the only valid offer. [C3.]    Utility Merger Talks End Abruptly  Merger talks broke down between the Public Service Enterprise Group, which operates New Jersey's largest energy concern, and Cinergy, a Midwest energy utility, executives close to the negotiations said. While the talks could still be revived, they said it was unlikely. Shares of PSEG fell 84 cents, to $41.61, while Cinergy dropped 67 cents, to $34.48. [C14.]    Copyrighted Song List to Napster  In compliance with a court order intended to curb the exchange of copyrighted music on Napster, the major record labels said they planned to deliver a list of 135,000 songs -- music that Napster will have three business days to prevent users from trading. The delivery starts the clock ticking on a process that could gut the amount and types of music Napster users have been able to exchange online. [C14.]    Possible Changes to Tax-Cut Plan  As the tax fight shifts to the Senate, Republicans who have consulted with the White House said the administration had identified two areas of possible compromise in the overall $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan: reducing the amount by which the top income tax rate would drop, and scaling back rather than repealing the estate tax. Those changes could whittle down the dollar figure by several hundred billion dollars. The savings could be used to make the plan smaller, or to add provisions that might attract support from moderates. [A1.]    Ernst & Young Loses Court Ruling  Ernst & Young, the accounting firm whose auditors the government contends failed to uncover a fraud at Cendant, lost an early court battle. A federal judge granted a motion filed by prosecutors to bar depositions by more than 40 potential witnesses in the trial of Walter A. Forbes, above, and E. Kirk Shelton, formerly the chairman and vice chairman of Cendant, who are charged with financial fraud. Ernst & Young asked the judge to either allow depositions by those witnesses or to delay all depositions. The judge refused. [C3.]    The Africa Problem for Drug Makers  This week, the unthinkable happened in Africa: the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies were forced into a painful negotiation over patent rights and the price of AIDS medicines. Suddenly, the question is no longer whether Africans will get life-saving drug cocktails, but how. That question lacks a simple answer; merely cutting prices will not automatically get drugs to patients. [A1.]    BP Faces Hard Choices in Alaska  Over the last few years, BP Amoco broke with most of the oil industry and positioned itself as a leader on environmental issues. Now, a group of American and British investors, hopes to introduce a shareholder resolution at the company's annual meeting on April 19 that asks BP to reconsider drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. They are likely to run into resistance.
