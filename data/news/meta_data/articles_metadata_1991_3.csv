Sometimes they do. A recent study by Michael D.

Mr. Hirsch tracks the holdings at least quarterly to insure the overlap never exceeds 20 percent.   Recently, Mr. Hirsch's has found an anomaly. Of the growth-and-income funds, for instance, 90 percent own shares in International Business Machines, as do more than one-third of the aggressive-growth funds. Philip Morris is another stock that appears in the portfolios of many funds."

Congress has never granted any agency a blank check to spend taxpayer money in private-sector bailouts; a special law has financed each rescue. But in a strange twist to a reform movement intended to shield taxpayers, the House and Senate Banking Committees would change the rules so that taxpayers henceforth absorb some of the cost of rescuing commercial banks. Softened Senate Bill     The original bills were much tougher on taxpayers than the version that emerged on Friday from the Senate Banking Committee -- a version negotiated by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, that preserves taxpayers' responsibility in principle, but in practice might drain away little public money. A consensus appears to be emerging in Congress for the mild Senate version. But whatever the actual language, the Fed and the White House have said in recent days that they will go along with a Congressional desire to recognize a taxpayer role.   The goal in Congress is to discipline the Fed, reflecting wide discontent with the Fed's practice of propping up failing banks. By forcing the Fed to draw on public funds when it lends to some weak banks, Congress hopes the central bank will become more reluctant to make loans from its ""discount window"" -- especially if they extend the life of a dying bank, adding to a bailout's cost.    ""The Fed would be forced to think twice about making the no-brainer kinds of loans it is now making,"" said Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.    The House and Senate panels would alter a practice that has existed since the 1930's: having the banking industry alone bear the cost of bailouts through premiums paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Fed, after lending money to banks that later collapsed, has always gone to the F.D.I.C. for reimbursement.    Now, the House Banking Committee, in a bill approved in June, and the Senate committee's milder provision, adopted on Friday, would require the Federal Reserve to justify lending to some banks in danger of failing and to draw on taxpayer funds if the loans exceeded certain limits set by Congress.    The Fed endorsed the tougher House version before the Senate acted on Friday. The Fed governors have not considered the Senate version, a spokesman said yesterday. A White House official yesterday praised the Senate version, mostly because the Senate dealt more to the White House's liking with the separate issue of rescuing big banks.   ""We think 'too big to fail' rescues should be done, but only in extraordinary cases of risk to the economy,"" said Robert R. Glauber, a Treasury under secretary. ""The Senate bill provides the necessary hurdles.""    The American Bankers Association, representing the nation's 12,000 commercial banks, did not pick between House and Senate versions, but is lobbying for the principle that taxpayers, as well as the banking industry, must pay the cost of failures.   The association's support for a taxpayer role is understandable: Its insurance fund is nearly gone and the premiums paid by the nation's banks have tripled in recent years, to 23 cents for each $100 of deposits. Study of Practices     A House Banking Committee study, released in June, spotlighted the Fed's lending practices. The report found that over the last six years, the Fed had made loans to more than 300 banks that ultimately failed. The Fed has not challenged this. The resulting extra losses from extending the lives of dying banks were less than $2 billion over five years, said L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C. chairman.    If Congress does, in fact, approve legislation that restricts Fed lending, the depositors most likely to be affected are those with uninsured funds -- more than $100,000 a depositor -- in a failing bank.    The Fed, by keeping a weak bank afloat, gives depositors time to transfer uninsured funds to healthy banks. If a weak bank was closed more quickly, people might not have time to do this.    Allowing deposits to migrate can make a bailout more costly. When the bank does fail or is merged, the F.D.I.C. has lost the opportunity to draw on uninsured deposits to help reimburse insured depositors or subsidize the merger.    ""The principle on which most of the people in Congress are operating is to try to prevent us from covering depositors over $100,000,"" Mr. Seidman said.  Limits on Lending     The House bill, in a key provison, limits to five days the period of time that the Federal Reserve can make loans to a bank whose capital, or available cash, falls below 2 percent of its outstanding loans. Any lending beyond five days would not be eligible for reimbursement. And the Fed could not collect collateral from the bank to assure F.D.I.C. reimbursement.   Instead, the money would have to come from the Fed's reserves. If it was lost, the Federal Reserve would have less to give the Treasury to help pay Government expenses, in effect putting more of a burden on taxpayers.    The House bill also permits the Treasury to rule whether a given bank's sudden failure would damage the financial system or a regional economy. Such a designation -- known as ""too big to fail"" -- would, when reported to Congress, enable the Fed to lend money to the bank to keep it going until a buyer could be found or the bank could be closed in some orderly fashion. The recent bailout of the Bank of New England is this sort of case. But under the House bill, the money would have to come from the Fed's pocket.  Compromise Is Accepted     The original Senate version would have imposed even tougher restrictions, requiring the Fed to lend from its own pocket to any ""significantly undercapitalized"" bank, whatever the period of time. But on Friday, the committee accepted a compromise pushed by Senator Gramm.    If a loan of, say, $10 million to an undercapitalized bank goes beyond the five-day limit or some other specified period, and the money is lost in a failure, the Fed would have to pay from its own pocket only the lost interest, say $400,000, but not the principal, as in the House version. The F.D.I.C. would repay the principal.   The Gramm compromise also changed the too-big-to-fail provision, requiring more public debate than the House version. Under the Senate provision, not only the Treasury, but also the President and five of the Fed's seven governors, must decide that a bank is too big to fail. Only then can the Treasury advance to the Fed the money to keep the bank temporarily alive. But the payout would not come from the taxpayers' pocket; the Treasury would eventually recover the outlay through a special assessment on commercial banks.  Champions of Restrictions     The Congressional goal of restricting the Fed is set forth most passionately by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Senator Riegle. This camp argues that the Fed too frequently tries to prolong the lives of banks that are clearly doomed and, as Mr. Gonzalez puts it, is ""cavalier"" in failing to report its lending practices to Congress.    Still, Senator Riegle's committee accepted a compromise put forth on Friday by Senator Gramm that assigned most of the bailout expense to the F.D.I.C. while preserving the principle of Fed accountability.    ""We never intended that the taxpayer should play a role; it is an unfortunate byproduct of an attempt to change the Fed's incentives,"" said Patrick Lawler, chief economist for the Senate Banking Committee. ""We think we now have something that deals with incentives, without putting any appreciable burden on the taxpayer.""   Although the Fed is not publicly fighting the Congressional effort, the restrictions run counter to the Fed's view of its role as an independent supplier of emergency funds.    ""I don't know that we are jumping up and down with joy, but we can understand what they are trying to do and we can live with it,"" John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said last week. ""But my own view is that the lack of any discretionary flexibility is a mistake. One of the principal reasons for the Fed's existence is to provide emergency liquidity."""

That isn't happening now. There was a modest upturn earlier this year, but construction is sluggish in much of the nation. This year, new housing starts are projected to tumble to the lowest level since 1945.   Housing is not leading the economy out of recession because, despite declines in interest rates and prices, only 43 percent of all American households can afford to buy a median-priced home in their region. In much of the East Coast and California, affordability figures are worse. In greater New York, for instance, only 22 percent of households can buy a median-priced home. In San Francisco, the figure is a dismal 9.2 percent."

The division, to be called Pegasus, would be similar in image and pricing to the upper-bracket lines introduced by Mazda's Japanese rivals: Acura from Honda, Lexus from Toyota and Infiniti from Nissan.   The arrival of Pegasus, expected in the 1994 model year, has been eagerly awaited by agencies across the country: it would set off a battle for a new account with estimated annual billings of $50 million to $60 million.   Foote, Cone & Belding, Los Angeles, is the agency for Mazda's existing model line.

James A. Unruh, the Unisys chairman, had said in April that the company would cut its work force to less than 70,000 by the end of the year. It was down to 72,000 by the end of the first quarter. No current figure is available, Mr. Hynes said.   In New York Stock Exchange trading today, shares of Unisys were unchanged, at $3.75."

That forces funds to invest in shorter-term, presumably safer, instruments. One fund chose to change its marketing approach -- and its name -- rather than its investment strategy. The Neuberger & Berman Ultra-Short Bond fund is perhaps the only hybrid, part money fund and part short-term bond fund. The average maturity of its holdings is 30 days to a year.

A few of those attending the Federal Reserve's annual summer conference, including the keynote speaker, went a step further. They argued that the 40-year-old free-trade system, in which more than 90 nations jointly agree to lower tariffs simultaneously, had outlived its usefulness and should give way to these regional trading blocs. The blocs can use tariffs to keep out imports from nations that are not members. Europe, North America Cited     These economists said that the European Community and the emerging United States-Mexico-Canada trading zone were already proving more effective than the older free-trade system, known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on two important counts. The blocs are generating huge increases in trade among neighboring countries, which are natural trading partners anyway. And, the economists said, regional blocs are becoming a way to exclude Japanese competitors, whose products receive equal treatment in the free-trade system."

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, however, told the visiting American Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, that he wanted more time to consider the matter.   King Hussein said, ""We are ready to attend a peace conference, and we are very happy indeed it is going to be a comprehensive one."" The Jordanian ruler spoke at a news conference with Mr. Baker after their talks in Amman, Jordan's capital.   Until now, Jordan has wavered on accepting the American proposal, waiting to see if Syria would.  5 Acceptances in His Pocket    Mr. Baker, armed with commitments from the five Arab countries to take part in a conference that would open the way for direct negotiations with Israel, flew here from Amman to try to persuade Mr. Shamir to drop his opposition to the proposed peace talks.   The Israeli Government, though, seemed shocked -- confronted by Mr. Baker after he obtained, over three days, commitments from the Arabs to take part in the conference and in subsequent direct talks.    Jordan also joined Saudi Arabia and Egypt in offering to suspend the Arab economic boycott of Israel if it will suspend the building of settlements in the occupied lands. And President Bush, on a visit to Turkey, again suggested that Israel halt settlement building on the West Bank.    The Israeli public appears skeptical about the latest round of American diplomacy, tempering hope with caution.  [ Page A6. ] Deadline or No Deadline    Mr. Baker denied that he had set a deadline for an Israeli response on peace talks, but American officials say it is possible that when President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Moscow on July 30 and 31, they will issue invitations to the conference -- as its joint sponsors -- whether the Israelis have responded positively or not. Such a move would put Israel under even greater pressure to attend.   ""We have always indicated that that would be something we might pursue,"" said Mr. Baker, when asked whether invitations would soon be sent. ""Of course, it would be much better, if there is going to be a conference, if everybody could sign on before invitations are issued.""    Senior Israeli officials said they had no idea what Mr. Shamir was going to do, and the Israeli Prime Minister was saying nothing.    Mr. Shamir's dilemma, though, is clear. If he says yes to Mr. Baker, his fragile coalition Government is likely to collapse and he will be challenged by members of his own rightist Likud bloc. If he says no, he risks alienating Israel from the United States, and from much of the rest of the world.   Mr. Baker met with Mr. Shamir alone for 90 minutes. The meeting was taken up almost entirely with a review of the essence of the letter that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria sent to Mr. Bush a week ago. In that letter, the Syrian leader is said to have committed his Government to take part in the peace conference and subsequent direct talks.   The Israelis have been deeply suspicious that Washington and Damascus struck some sort of deal. American officials said that Mr. Baker, without actually showing Mr. Shamir the Assad letter, had briefed him both on its contents and on the side assurances that the United States had provided the Syrians. What U.S. Would Do for Syria    Those side assurances mostly involve restatements of American policy: that the United States does not recognize the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights; that it believes that United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, calling on Israel to exchange land for peace, applies to the Golan Heights as well as to the West Bank, and that the United States is committed to pushing any peace negotiations actively, so as not to allow delays.    Mr. Shamir asked Mr. Baker for more time to consider the matter, and the two men will be meeting again on Monday. ""We are not under any pressure to give an answer soon,"" the Prime Minister's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said. ""The problem is content, not deadlines.""   Before Mr. Baker met with Mr. Shamir, he held talks with three West Bank Palestinian leaders, led by Faisal al-Husseini, and made it clear to them that they, too, had to make some hard decisions. American officials said it was a tough, and at times emotional, encounter in which the Palestinians were essentially told that as the weakest party in the equation, they would have to accept previously unpalatable political realities.    One of those is that the Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Yasir Arafat, can have no direct involvement with their delegation to the peace conference, since that would prompt the Israelis to walk out immediately.    The other is that no Palestinians from East Jerusalem can take part in the first stage of the negotiations. The Israelis have ruled this out, arguing that such a role would imply that East Jerusalem, which Israel has annexed, was negotiable.    But it is possible that the second restriction might be finessed if there is a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and Palestinians born in Jerusalem take part with Jordanian passports.   Despite those restrictions, the Palestinian leaders were told that they would soon have to come up with a list of acceptable representatives, American officials said.    An intriguing thing about the endorsements that Mr. Baker has won from the Arab countries is that the Arab leaders all say in public that they are ready to accept Mr. Bush's proposal to attend ""a peace conference"" to reach a ""comprehensive solution"" based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. But none of them ever mentions that this conference is intended as a ceremonial opening event for direct Arab-Israeli talks.   American officials insist that the Arab leaders have privately assured them that they understand this, but do not now want to say it publicly for fear of alienating their own hard-liners. Each one, instead, allows Mr. Baker to say it for him.   Thus, when reporters asked King Hussein today if he would say in public that he was committed to direct talks with Israel, he was not pleased.    Looking a bit flummoxed, the King replied, ""This is about the most ridiculous question I have ever heard.""   If it is so simple, the reporters persisted, why not give just a simple answer?    ""What do you attend a conference to do?"" the King retorted. ""To mime? To make faces at each other, or to discuss and try to resolve the problem? I have been calling for this for years and years. I assure you that this is really the intention, and it is very, very clear.""   As the journalists continued to press the King to say the words ""direct bilateral talks with Israel,"" he declared the news conference over and walked out with Mr. Baker.                    --------------------       BUSH REITERATES VIEW    ISTANBUL, Turkey, July 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Bush, on a visit to Turkey, suggested once again today that Israel should be flexible for the sake of peace in the Middle East and halt settlement building on the West Bank.    ""The question of settlements has been important,"" Mr. Bush said, in response to a reporter's question at a meeting here today with Turkish opposition leaders. ""I haven't encountered anybody in this part of the world that thinks increasing settlements is a helpful thing. And the United States policy has been opposed to it for years.""    The President also said he did not want to use a ""volatile"" word like pressure in talking about his stance with the Israelis. He preferred to call it ""reasoning and taking this -- what I keep calling a new credibility for the United States in the Middle East -- and using that to encourage what is a very reasonable and important step to peace."""

Evidently the movie is spawning a mini-stampede of executives to cattle drives in search of the same rugged experience. AmyGrubbs, executive director of the Dude Rancher's Association, says she has seen ""a significant increase"" in inquiries since ""City Slickers"" was released in June.

In June, First Interstate Bank of Texas bought the defunct Commonwealth Federal Savings Association, which added 33 branches and $1.1 billion in deposits to the Houston-based company."

Baker 3d presented Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh of the Soviet Union with a new approach today for settling the issues holding up a nuclear arms reduction treaty, but the two ministers wrangled over the details all day, Administration officials said.   The two sides broke up their third day of talks late in the evening and scheduled an unexpected bargaining session for Saturday. One official said that Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh appeared to be narrowing their differences on two critical issues: how to define new types of missiles for the purposes of the treaty and how to monitor each other's missile tests to insure compliance with the treaty.   But the third and final major issue -- ""downloading,"" or how many spare spaces for warheads each side can keep on its missiles -- remained an obstacle, with the Soviets rejecting Mr. Baker's proposals. All or Nothing    In proposing a new, comprehensive approach for settling the treaty issues, the Americans told the Soviets that they must accept the plan in full, officials said, or its separate elements would be invalid. The package incorporates some of the new proposals that Mr. Bessmertnykh brought from Moscow.   Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh are to meet on Saturday to see if they can finally close the treaty.  American officials said they could not predict whether the ministers would reach agreement Saturday on all the basic elements of the treaty or declare that further talks would be needed. The Soviet Foreign Minister had originally planned to leave Washington today.    If they cannot bridge their differences on Saturday, the two sides may try to settle them when President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet for a two-hour lunch in London on Wednesday, officials said.  Summit Hinges on Treaty    A full, two- or three-day summit meeting of the two leaders in late July or early August in Moscow will only be scheduled if the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, is completed.   Under the proposed treaty, which has been under negotiation since 1982, the Soviet Union would reduce its arsenal of strategic nuclear warheads from 11,000 to 7,000 while the United States decreased its stocks from 12,000 to 9,000.    Mr. Baker has been accompanied at the talks by a joint team from the State Department, Pentagon, Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Council staff. Mr. Bessmertnykh has been advised by his arms control experts as well as the chief of staff of the Soviet armed forces, Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev.  Experts Work on Details    Neither Mr. Baker nor Mr. Bessmertnykh would comment on their discussions as they left the State Department this evening. Experts from the two sides stayed behind to continue working on the details through the night.    Depending on how the Soviets respond on other issues, the two sides appear to have reached a compromise formula for resolving the dispute over new types of missiles, American officials said.   Under the proposed treaty, neither side can test a missile with more warheads than it is defined to have, unless it is declared a ""new type."" The Soviets have sought a narrow definition of what constitutes a new type of missile so that they could easily add spare capacity to an existing missile and then test it with only a minor modification in design.   For example, American officials said, the Soviet Union could take its SS-25 long-range missile, which carries one warhead, and with a small expansion in payload capacity declare it to be a ""new type"" and then test it with three warheads. A Potential Danger    The Bush Administration sees this as a potential danger. If the Soviets were tempted to break out of the treaty in a crisis, they would then be in a position to quickly triple the number of warheads on all 700 of the single-warhead SS-25's that they are expected to deploy under the treaty.   The United States has sought a requirement that a missile undergo at least a 30 percent change in its payload capacity before it can be classified as a new type. The Americans have also insisted that there be a change in the diameter of the missile's first stage, so that the Soviets would be prevented from quickly expanding capacity by turning a few screws.   The Soviets wanted to require only a 15 percent change in payload and a percentage change in only the length of the first stage, which would be easier to modify. The two sides now appear to be ready to split the difference, officials said.  Experts See Little Risk    Most arms control experts feel that even with a compromise on this issue accepting the lower Soviet number, the United States would be risking little.   ""I think there is room for compromise on this issue without drastically compromising our security,"" said Dunbar Lockwood, a senior analyst at the Arms Control Association. ""Because even a 15 to 20 percent change in payload capacity would require a fairly substantial change in the missile design that would be difficult to do quickly.""   The other issue on which differences have apparently narrowed is telemetry encription, also known as ""data denial."" This involves determining how much, and by what means, data from missile tests are beamed back to earth, so that each side can easily monitor the other's tests and insure that the other side is not developing missiles restricted by the treaty.   The United States wants a ban on encoding missile test data for the purpose of denying it to the other side, a prohibition established by the draft treaty. But because the two sides use different frequencies, power levels and techniques, they must work out common standards, which can involve major and costly electronic adjustments.   After much wrangling over that issue, the Soviets have agreed to an American proposal that the two sides exchange tapes of data from missile tests, officials said. But they are still discussing how much data should be put on each tape and whether tapes would have to be exchanged on every test -- as the Americans want -- or only on some tests, as the Soviets prefer. A Fine Balance    This is a complicated issue not only because it is highly technical -- Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh acknowledge that they do not understand the details -- but also because it means striking a very fine balance. It is difficult to come up with language that is tight enough to guarantee both sides that they will get all the basic telemetry information they need from the other to verify compliance with the treaty, yet loose enough to avoid surrendering any information on their missile systems beyond what is required.   The main sticking point at the talks tonight was on the issue of downloading, which involves the limits set by .  the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty on the number of nuclear warheads for both sides.    Many missiles now carry 10 warheads. Both sides would prefer to reduce the number of warheads without having to build new missiles expressly designed for only a certain number of warheads.   The more missiles each side has to spread out its warheads, the more difficult it is to destroy them and the less incentive there is for a first strike.   But to accomplish a reduction in the number of warheads, , missiles capable of carrying 10 warheads would have to be ""downloaded"" to carry fewer. Under the treaty they would be counted as if they carried fewer -- even though they would have spare capacity. But if one side or the other broke out of the treaty, that capacity could actually be ""uploaded"" to carry 10 warheads again. How Many Spaces    The Soviets wanted to download all of their SS-N-18 submarine-launched ballistic missiles from 7 warheads to 3 warheads -- for a total of 896 spaces -- plus an additional 750 warhead spaces on three other types of missiles.   They argued that since they had already stopped deploying the MOD-3 version of the SS-N-18, which carries seven warheads, and were only deploying the single-warhead MOD-1's, those should not even count as being downloaded.   The United States argued that only 1,000 warheads should be downloaded and that the Soviets should count all of their SS-N-18's, plus one other missile. The United States proposed to accomplish its own downloading by removing two out of the three warheads in each of its 550 Minuteman missiles."

The impasse has also prompted some Administration and private trade experts to question the United States' wisdom in insisting on the virtual elimination of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies as the key to any deal to liberalize international trade."

The increases amount to 3 to 4 percent for the average car, and more -- sometimes much more -- if a car is redesigned, as the Ford Taurus or the Toyota Camry have been, or is equipped with costly new devices, like the driver-side air bags in the 1992 Honda Accord.    On the face of it, such increases in a car's list, or sticker, price are likely to discourage many Americans from buying 1992 models at a moment when the national economy is weak and people are nervous about job security. Given this reluctance to spend, the laws of supply and demand suggest that prices should fall, or at least not rise, if the industry is to sell all of the 1992 cars soon to be made.

The report, which was somewhat better than expected, touched off a rally in the market for fixed-income securities as investors and traders viewed it as increasing the chances of a new and prompt easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.    ""The economy would benefit from additional monetary stimulation, and there's very little chance of stirring up inflation by doing so,"" asserted Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. The trade group's members closely follow the Producer Price Index since it reflects transactions with their suppliers. Expectations of the Fed     The Federal Reserve generally seeks to avoid appearing to respond to any particular piece of economic news but analysts said today that the next, long-anticipated round of rate cuts could come at any time. On Friday morning the Government is to publish its comprehensive report on retail sales during August and on inflation at the consumer level. Both are expected to reflect sluggish economic conditions.   ""This prepares the way some more for the Fed to ease,"" said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Fuji Securities in Chicago. Comparing a cut in short-term rates to an apple fully ripened on a tree, he said, ""Today, tomorrow, we know it's going to fall.""    The most recent Fed easing came in early August on the heels of weak employment data.    The two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the index for finished goods followed modest declines for June and July, but analysts noted that prices would have been unchanged if energy prices are excluded. They added that political uncertainty in the Soviet Union, the world's biggest oil producer, was a chief factor for a 4.6 percent jump in gasoline, which had dropped 5.5 percent in July. Oil Prices Letting Up     Recently, oil prices have eased and economists said they did not expect overall energy prices -- up 1.8 percent last month -- to prove an obstacle to further reductions in inflation.   The so-called core rate of inflation, which eliminates food as well as energy, also rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August. This was the same pace as in July and in May, with June unchanged. The Labor Department revised downward today the pace of inflation it reported earlier for April and May.   Of further encouragement to analysts was the fact that the producer price indexes for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production were also held in check. Intermediate goods rose four-tenths of 1 percent over all, but just one-tenth without energy; crude goods were unchanged over all, but 1.1 percent lower without energy.   A dress or suit of clothes would be an example of a finished good, an item that will not undergo further processing and is ready for sale to the final user, either an individual consumer or a business. In this case, a bolt of cloth would be the intermediate good and the raw cotton or wool the crude good. 'Inflation Is Under Control'     ""These figures conclusively demonstrate that inflation is under control,"" said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, noting that core inflation at the producer level has remained at about 2.5 percent since February.   The 1.8 percent jump in finished energy prices last month, which included a decline in residential natural gas, was significantly offset by a four-tenths of 1 percent decline in consumer foods. Beef and veal fell 4.7 percent, and prices also fell for fish, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, soft drinks and pork.   But passenger cars and tobacco prices both advanced 1.1 percent as did women's apparel, household appliances, prescription drugs, glassware and textbooks. Automobile prices fell four-tenths of 1 percent before seasonal adjustment. Prices for Manufacturers     Among intermediate goods, materials for nondurable manufacturing, like paint and chemicals, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the first increase for this category since November, the report showed. Materials for durable manufacturing, like copper and brass mill shapes, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent following a one-tenth of 1 percent decline in July.   Finished capital equipment rose one-tenth of 1 percent for the second straight month, as increases for cars, civilian aircraft, agricultural machinery and construction machiner more than offset lower prices for computers, oilfield machinery and trucks.   For the first eight months of the year, prices of finished goods have fallen at an annual rate of 1.1 percent, the report also showed. Since August 1990 there has been a 2 percent advance."

These developments brought this country to the brink of catastrophe. The situation that evolved in this country after the putsch, should it get out of control, could bring about unpredictable consequences both inside this country and in our relations with foreign countries."

American aid to Israel may actually be larger than that, since it consists not only of the well-known grants and loans that prop up the Israeli economy and bolster its military, but also seldom-noticed indirect assistance. This includes such items as huge transfers of surplus military equipment, subsidies for Israel's foreign aid program and assistance to refugees arriving from the Soviet Union, State Department and Congressional officials say."

But experts said Iraq could still cause a price jolt, because President Saddam Hussein might not go along with the conditions tied to the sale or because bureaucratic problems could delay exports.    In the long term, however, a return of Iraqi oil to world markets would tend to push prices lower, and some analysts believe that this United Nations decision, which covers a six-month period, is likely to be the beginning of uninterrupted sales by Iraq.     The United Nations said Iraq could export $1.6 billion worth of oil over six months, which at current prices comes to about 500,000 barrels a day. This is a substantial increment on world markets; for example, the combined quotas of all the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is now 22.3 million barrels a day. OPEC is scheduled to meet on Tuesday in Vienna, and the organization may set a new quota based on anticipated demand for oil and production from around the world, including Iraq."

Hardly.    True, Seoul pursued industrial policy before anybody in Washington invented the term. ""There really was a Government-business partnership in which Government very much had the upper hand,"" said Stanley Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Korea's authoritarian Government threw a protectionist blanket over infant industries, regularly butted into financial markets to control the flow of credit, and, time and again, bullied business into doing what it wanted."

First, be sure the company that issued a policy is licensed to do business in the policyholder's state. In nearly every state, licensed insurers must contribute to a state-run life insurance guarantee fund, which is intended to protect policyholders if an insurer fails. And licensed insurers must undergo annual audits by state insurance regulators. Some experts recommend that no matter where a policyholder lives, he or she should buy a policy from a company that is licensed in New York because its regulators are considered the toughest and most vigilant."

Clearly, the agreement provides Mr. Icahn with the rare opportunity to fix a problem of his own making: the crushing debt load he piled on T.W.A. in 1988 to take it private. If approved, the agreement will shore up the balance sheet, sharply reduce interest costs and shave the amount of time the company would ultimately have to spend in bankruptcy court renegotiating its contracts."

And it may not last. But Argentines and international bankers here are hoping that an economic turnaround has arrived after more than two years of recession, repeated bouts of hyperinflation and isolation from the world financial community.    At the beginning of this month, the average daily trading volume on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange was a paltry $5 million. On Friday it soared to $115 million, and the value of stocks has doubled in the same period."

And all through this period, what economists call real interest rates -- the difference between interest rates on borrowed money and the inflation rate -- have remained high. High real rates are usually seen as a threat to economic activity and an obstacle to a strong recovery after recession.    Such concerns are justified, most economists say. The real test of the impact of interest rates is their level in relation to the inflation rate. The closer the two rates are to each other, the greater the likelihood that salaries and prices will rise sufficiently to offset the cost of a loan. Sometimes interest rates on loans can be falling, but if the inflation rate is falling even faster, the real cost of the loan rises."

To do that, they buy and sell their currencies in the world's $600 billion-a-day foreign exchange market and coordinate their economic policies with one another. Corporations with large sales or operations abroad do not like volatility in the foreign exchange market either. It makes it difficult for them to produce relatively stable quarterly earnings.   But foreign exchange traders love movement: it is a time to make money, not only from trading one currency for another but also from hedging for corporations seeking to protect themselves from the impact of volatility.   Since 1973, when the world abandoned its post-World War II system of fixed exchange rates in favor of the current floating exchange-rate system, traders -- not governments -- have been getting their way. The markets have been volatile. From the beginning of this year until July, the dollar rose 27 percent against the German mark. In the last three weeks, the dollar has fallen 5 percent against the mark. In the same period, the dollar has moved up sharply against most other currencies.   The quarterly reports for the banks that are active traders in the foreign exchange market show that volatility has been good for them. Foreign exchange revenues for the first quarter, when the dollar was most volatile, were up 27 percent to $701 million for the 15 major trading banks in the United States, according to figures compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers. Two Who Have Won J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust    For dozens of banks, revenue from foreign exchange operations has become much more important as other areas of their business have suffered. Banks earn fees on foreign exchange services for corporate customers and profit from daily and long-term trading, often with their own money. Fee-based operations, which carry less risk for the bank, are growing. This makes revenue from the category ""foreign exchange"" more reliable and stable than its name might otherwise imply.    James M. Rosenberg, a banking analyst at Shearson, has used this argument as the basis of his decision to raise the ratings recently of the stock of Bankers Trust Company and J.P. Morgan & Company. Both banks actively conduct trading and hedging operations for their clients. Mr. Rosenberg said this dependable stream of earnings means the banks' stocks were ""materially undervalued.""    In the first half of this year, J.P. Morgan, the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust, had revenue from foreign exchange of $149 million, or 30 percent of net income. Bankers Trust did better, with revenue from foreign exchange of $182 million or 53 percent of net income.    ""The balance has shifted a bit more toward customers,"" said Peter D. Hancock, the managing director for global markets at J.P.  Morgan. ""There is a recognition of the important niche that Morgan holds because of its customer franchise. But this is not to say that we do not have a certain appetite for risk.""  What Customers Want The Biggest Banks Are Most Popular    With so many banks competing for business, which ones do corporations prefer? In foreign exchange, it does not hurt to be big. Of the top five banks rated as best by corporate treasurers and other customers in Euromoney magazine, four -- Citicorp, Barclays Bank, National Westminster and Union Bank of Switzerland -- are among the 30 largest banks in the world. Morgan Guaranty Trust, rated third, is 59th in assets worldwide.    The Euromoney list also showed that investment banks are making their mark. Goldman Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley & Company are now rated among the world's 20 most preferred currency traders.   But the credit ratings of the banks themselves also seem to play a role in why some are favored. The banks that rose in the rankings -- like J.P. Morgan, which went from eighth place to third, and Union Bank of Switzerland, which went from 17th to fifth -- both had credit ratings from the Standard and Poor's Corporation of AAA, five levels higher than the rating for Chemical Bank, which fell from third to seventh, and Chase Manhattan, which fell from sixth to 14th in the rankings. These higher ratings bring in customers who are concerned about the state of the banking system and want to do their longer-term transactions with banks considered healthy.    The credit rating issue is very important to the new foreign exchange operations that will be created at the merged Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust.    In comments to analysts, John McGillicuddy, who will be chairman of the combined bank, made clear that the key to improving the new bank's foreign exchange revenues will be to make the financial moves necessary to raise the bank's credit rating first to an A and then to an AA.    ""We really have professionals that can execute in these areas if we give them an improved rating to operate with,"" Mr. McGillicuddy told the analysts. ""There are several banking institutions in this city, for example, that really kind of have the field to themselves right now, and it's not, in our judgment, because they're better than we are."" Traders Without Jobs Cost Cutting In Currency Units     The explosive growth of the foreign currency market in the 1980's brought new banks and scores of new traders into the business. Now they are elbowing each other for a share. At the same time, cost cutting in the banking industry has spread even to lucrative areas like foreign exchange. Traders are beginning to feel the pain.   A few foreign banks, like Hill Samuel International of Britain, have closed their New York foreign exchange operations. On the West Coast, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Barclays Bank of Britain have closed their operations.    The New York market is especially tight. At Union Bank of Switzerland and many other banks, managers do not move quickly to replace traders who have left.   ""Traders are suffering for the first time,"" said David Rivers, the executive editor of FX Week, a newsletter for currency traders.   Anthony G. Mecca, a former foreign exchange trader turned headhunter, said job listings are down about 40 percent from a year ago. He has had to turn the efforts of his own firm, the Paulen Company, toward other kinds of job searches because of the slowdown.    ""A lot of the people who were unemployed last summer are still unemployed,"" he said, adding that he has seen more than 30 traders this year who had lost their jobs.   One of the reasons for the cutbacks, beyond cost, is that the boom in foreign exchange trading in the 1980's brought a lot of people into the market who are having trouble handling the business today.    ""The 1980's brought in a lot of people who were not up to the quality and talent that you need today,"" said Robert A. White, vice president at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. He said increased volatility and quick changes in the direction of the foreign exchange market make it much more difficult to make money now than when the dollar was generally going down every day in the mid- and late 1980's.    Traders hired now tend to be more experienced. ""I would look for seasoned traders with a good track record,"" said Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, a Finnish bank in New York. ""And a good track record does not mean volatile earnings. A good track record would mean an upward slope in earnings.""    The threat of more bank mergers, like the joining of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover, means there could be other traders on the street soon looking for jobs. Mr. Mecca believes Chemical has the stronger foreign exchange operation, which means it will be dominant in the combining of the companies' operations. But he believes David Puth, manager of foreign exchange at Chemical, will run counter to the rule in the market and take younger people so he can train them. This time ""I think you will see a lot of senior people out on the street,"" he said. A bank spokesman, Joyce Oberdorf, said the bank will train younger traders, ""but not at the expense of senior people.""   For one senior trader in particular, the situation is a little queasy. J. Thomas Stanley, who was vice president and manager for corporate exchange at Chemical Bank, left three months ago. He left to do the same job at Manufacturers Hanover Trust. At this time, Mr. Stanley has no comment about his future. THE DUAL ROLE OF OPTIONS    ON the floor of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and in banks and investment banks around the world, currency options are being used increasingly to hedge against foreign-exchange losses.    Currency options are a type of right. They give their owners the opportunity to buy a unit of a currency at a prearranged price sometime in the future. As a result, they are an insurance policy against unwanted or unanticipated moves in the foreign exchange market. Options are traded on exchanges in a number of standard forms or individually crafted for special customer needs by banks and investment banks.    While options offer protection, they also give companies the opportunity to take advantage of a positive move. The cost of combining insurance and opportunity is much higher than traditional forms of hedging, which use forwards -- contracts to buy currencies in the future at current price.   Forwards also offer insurance against adverse moves by locking in an exchange rate, but they offer no chance for gains. According to International Risk Control Inc., a foreign exchange consulting firm in Redwood City, Calif., a three-month option can cost four times more than a forward contract or about 3 percent of face value.    Even though options are more expensive, their use is growing. According to Greenwich Associates, a foreign exchange consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn., companies that use options spent a median of $150 million on them last year, up from $90 million the year before."

The system is in place at three banks, with more expected to begin in the next few months."

Lars Gullstedt announced his $1 billion plan this week to alter the face of Atlanta's famous Peachtree Street, there was nearly as much curiosity about the quiet man behind the project as there was about his elaborate model.   Over the last year, Mr. Gullstedt assembled a 10-square-block parcel midway between downtown Atlanta and the fashionable new office towers clustered near the Woodruff Memorial Arts Center.   But he has remained an enigma. Known in Stockholm for his three-million-square-foot commercial and industrial development called GLG Center, Mr. Gullstedt has no American holdings outside Atlanta.   As he purchased one parcel of midtown property after another, Mr. Gullstedt made no public comments about his intentions. Then, on Tuesday, his 56th birthday, Mr. Gullstedt announced a plan to build nearly 20 million square feet of residential, office, hotel and retail buildings on his holdings. The developer plans high-rise buildings that combine apartments, offices and retail shopping.   ""People will like to live closer to their work and to entertainment and culture, said Hans Tiveus, president of Gullstedt Gruppen. ""That's why we are not interested in building a single high-rise development for offices. In this development, you can live, work, entertain and shop and you can be less dependent on cars.""   With Mr. Tiveus's assistance as translator, Mr. Gullstedt said he began his career with nothing. His parents were farmers in Finland, and he was a carpenter for two years in the late 1950's before working for an engineering company.   He later started a construction company and eventually looked for opportunities overseas. ""Through my lawyer, I heard about the land in Atlanta,"" Mr. Gullstedt said.   Construction already has begun on a 50-story, mixed-use office tower on 14th Street, and work is scheduled to begin next month on Mr. Gullstedt's project to renovate the 77-year-old Biltmore Hotel and surround it with 11-story apartment and office buildings."

As the major republics proclaim independence and vow to pull away from the central Soviet system, insurgent leaders like Mayor Gavriil K. Popov of Moscow are voicing suspicions that there is far too much opportunity in the current breakdown for Communist apparatchiks to stay in place by switching to some new libertarian label out in the provinces, where the party has long been the basic institution.    In the current confusion about whether and how to design a new national political system -- be it federation, commonwealth or something vaguer -- the leaders of the major republics are indeed trying to survive first personally in their home precincts astride reliable organizations manned by loyal patronage networks, whatever they may be called.    Chief among these is Leonid M. Kravchuk, the leader of the Ukraine, who is facing a presidential election on Dec. 1 and a potential new lease on power as the leading ex-Communist survivor in what could be a powerful independent republic.    Ranking with him is Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the Kazakhstan leader who, while not making an independence proclamation, took care to have his republic's Communist Party break away from the national party as the latter became the chief target of condemnations and bannings.    The two leaders run the major republics flanking the nation's keystone republic, the Russian federation. All three would be required as the nucleus of whatever new nationwide political system might be attempted. At the very least they need each other economically as the political miasma continues.    This is the reason that the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, has reached out to both his neighbors with a proposal to find new ways to build mutual trust beyond the collapsing union. When republics began proclaiming independence, Mr. Yeltsin compounded the general anxiety by warning that he would raise the potentially explosive issue of readjusting borders if any of his neighbors wanted to secede.   In trying to repair the political damage from this hasty broadside, which critics characterized as Czarist and bullying, Mr. Yeltsin sent emissaries to apologize to his neighbors. More important, he proposed that Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and other republics that might be interested, find fresh trust for some new association by agreeing to emphasize their economic ties and improve them through free-market pioneering.  Biting the Hand That Fed Them    This is the only germ of an idea for a new national system that republic leaders have been discussing as they join in the general lambasting of the Communist Party, which brought most of them to power in the first place.    Ordinary citizens are delighting in measuring the relative times the three republic leaders chose to leap from the Communist ship. Mr. Yeltsin is the pre-eminent populist apostate, having left over a year ago, vowing to undo the then combative and vindictive party. The others left only in recent days as the party foundered after the unsuccessful Kremlin coup d'etat.    The one politician who dares not relish Mr. Yeltsin's relative purity is Mr. Yeltsin, for he needs his neighbors if some new approach at national reconstruction is to be attempted.    More basically, he has to protect vital economic ties that are being carefully itemized lately in public remarks by Mr. Kravchuk, the Ukrainian leader who turned in his party card at the 11th hour to pursue Ukrainian nationalism full time.  Interdependence Reins Yeltsin    The Ukraine needs Russian oil in the same way that Russia needs Ukrainian grain, he stresses in a typical ecumenical appeal that is replacing now forbidden Communist dogma on the hustings.    Seeing to his survival with voters, Mr. Kravchuk now regularly points to the border issue to raise the Ukraine's traditional wariness of being Russia's ""colony,"" an specter Mr. Yeltsin's blunt style serves all too well to reinforce.    More to the point, Mr. Kravchuk also is pointing to his republic's economic uncertainties. He notes that its pre-eminence, for example, at producing over 90 percent of the nation's locomotives is rooted in the fact that the parts for these locomotives come from 800 factories across the union.    The concrete truth of this interdependence is what prevents Mr. Yeltsin from skewering, as he might like, the credentials of Mr. Kravchuk and other leaders of the major republics now attempting to survive their past lives in the Communist hierarchy.    As leader of Russia, the largest republic with the largest needs, President Yeltsin has to look beyond the many hypocrisies and ironies of the political storm if its centrifigal threat to Soviet life is ever to be eased."

'So Far as It May Be Practical' . . .,"    Hat in hand, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev goes to London this week to meet with leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. His goal is to win some relief for his nation's rheumatic economy, and last week he said he would ask for investment from the West rather than for direct aid. As some of the opinions expressed here indicate, experts are divided on what it would take to make such a plan work, what strings should be attached -- or indeed whether aid for development would really help solve the deeply entrenched troubles of the Soviet economy.    One plan to spur Soviet economic recovery -- devised by a group of Soviet and Harvard academics -- proposes direct Western aid along the lines of the Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild Europe after World War II. A spokesman for Mr. Gorbachev said last week that the Yavlinsky Plan -- named for one of its Soviet authors -- would be one source for plans that the Soviet leader would bring to London this week. Here are some excerpts.  "

The gesture was typical of the style of the bank, which spent millions around the world in efforts to influence public officials. B.C.C.I. was seized last month by financial regulators in seven countries after the Bank of England uncovered evidence of widespread fraud, drug trafficking and money laundering.   Mr. Young said he regarded the debt forgiveness as belated payment of $50,000 in annual retainer fees that the bank had promised his consulting firm while he was Atlanta's Mayor. Mr. Young was Mayor from 1982 to 1990 and remains one of Georgia's most influential public figures.

But ""buckyballs,"" an unusual form of carbon first identified in 1985 and now thought to have huge commercial potential, may have been built into a lung-scanning device developed in Australia before anyone realized they existed.   As a result, the inventor of the lung scanner and the Australian company making it are pressing broad patent claims covering the best-known method for making buckyballs and related molecules. Their claims, which have been greeted skeptically to date, pit them against the University of Arizona and the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Germany, whose researchers developed the machinery now used to make most of the buckyballs being sold to fellow researchers throughout the world.

The researchers at Microelectronics, a consortium owned by a group of electronics companies, contend that the devices make it possible to build much faster computers.   Superconductors conduct electricity with no resistance. Traditional superconductors must be cooled to almost absolute zero, or 273 degrees below zero Centigrade, and newer materials function at somewhat higher temperatures. For electrical circuits, the advantage of superconductors lies in their speed and their sensitivity to faint electrical signals, traits that can help overcome bottlenecks in high-speed processing circuits. But superconductors are far less efficient that semiconductor devices for storing information, which is a crucial component for all computer operations.   The problem has been linking superconductor transistors, which produce signals with tiny voltages, and semiconductors that require much higher voltages. The key to the new invention is a tiny amplifier, small enough so that 1,000 can be placed on a single computer chip.   Dr. Harry Kroger and Uttam Ghoshal, a research associate, received patent 5,024,993.     Patents are available by number for $1.50 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.  "

As Mr. Basson now tells it, he was actually an army reserve major employed in an elaborate plot by the South African military to manipulate Namibia's transition to independence. Mr. Basson said his role in the conspiracy, which he contended had Cabinet authorization, was to devise a press campaign that camouflaged a murkier intelligence operation aimed at subverting the South-West Africa People's Organization, the black liberation movement popularly called Swapo.  Reducing Victory Margin     The strategy, he said, reduced Swapo's margin of victory to 57 percent of the vote in the United Nations-supervised elections in Namibia in November 1989. This fell well short of the two-thirds majority that Swapo needed to impose the socialist-oriented constitution it preferred. The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, which Mr. Basson served as a spokesman, emerged with 28 percent and sits as the official opposition in Parliament."

Then by late Wednesday, when the political threat had abated, all three funds were at or above their Friday closes, and value-oriented traders who had bought shares were counting their profits. ""It was like Christmas,"" said Thomas J. Herzfeld, the president of a Miami investment firm that specializes in closed-end funds.    Since the country funds are, in his view, the least efficient sector of the closed-end fund industry to start with, political bombshells tend to widen the discount that typically exists between prices and the funds' underlying asset values. ""People overreact on the downside and the upside,"" Mr. Herzfeld said, suggesting that the opportunity to trade against the crowd may not be over. ""Now you have people reasoning if the hard-liners are out of the picture, reforms can go forward at a faster pace."""

Louis Borget, president of the Enron Oil unit, and Thomas N. Mastroeni, its vice president, were charged in a civil suit filed by the S.E.C. with violating Federal securities laws. - Without admitting or denying guilt, they have agreed to settle the commission's charges. The settlement bars them from violating the laws again.   The suit contended that the men had engaged in commodities trading that exceeded limits set by Enron.

Gutfreund said he would resign from Salomon Brothers in the wake of the widening scandal involving illegal bidding in the Treasury securities market. The powerful chairman molded the firm into the premier bond-trading house on Wall Street. The firm's president, Thomas W. Strauss, also said he would step down, and Warren E. Buffett, who has a big stake in the firm, said he would step in as chairman temporarily.  [ Page 1. ]   For Gutfreund, the move was a shocking and abrupt end to an otherwise impressive 38-year career. He has led the firm for 13 years and was once dubbed the ""King of Wall Street.""  [ 33. ]   Buffett has a reputation for high integrity, brilliant investing and a caustic attitude regarding the foibles of Wall Street. And with a $700 million investment, he has a big interest in getting Salomon straightened out.  [ 33. ]   Salomon still faces many legal and regulatory problems. It is too early to say how they will eventually affect the firm.  [ 44. ]   John W. Meriwether did not offer to resign. It is unclear whether the fiercely competitive vice chairman will stay.  [ 44. ]  The Economy    The trade deficit narrowed in June to $4.02 billion, the lowest monthly level in eight years, on a resurgence of exports of manufactured goods, low oil prices and shrinking demand for imports, the Commerce Department said.  [ 1. ]   Bush said he would sign a bill providing extended unemployment benefits but would block spending of the $5.8 billion.  [ 1. ]   Production rose at U.S. factories, mines and utilities for a fourth straight month in July, the Fed said.  [ 34. ]  Companies    Mazda is expected to announce details of a new luxury-car division next week that will begin operating in the U.S. in 1994. Mazda hopes to challenge the Infiniti Q-45 and Lexus LS 400.  [ 33. ]   Chevron, Mobil, Shell and Texaco agreed to settle a long-running price-fixing case for more than $180 million, California officials said. Each company agreed to pay $45 million.  [ 33. ]   Pioneer Hi-Bred's bumpy ride through the 1980's illustrates that the pursuit of wonder products does not necessarily yield wonder profits.  [ 33. ]   Orion Pictures has struck a deal with bondholders that will keep it out of bankruptcy court, and the company's shares plunged. John W. Kluge, Orion's majority stockholder, will put in $50 million in exchange for the bondholders forgiving $267 million in debt.  [ 35. ]   Electronic Data Systems said it had won its hostile bid for control of SD-Scicon, a British computer services company.  [ 35. ]  Markets    The stock market dropped sharply, shaken by the turmoil at Salomon Brothers and some spotty bad news on earnings. The Dow ended at 2,968.02, off 30.41 for the day and 28.18 for the week.  [ 33. ]   Prices of Treasury securities were little changed, as dealers kept one eye on new economic data and the other on Salomon.  [ 36. ]   The dollar staged another broad advance, with dealers saying the rise reflected relief that rate increases by Germany's central bank failed to attract much buying of the mark.  [ 41. ]   Platinum futures prices rose more than $5, ending a three-day string of losses.  [ 41. ]  Today's Columns    Many people are scrambling to get a better return with short-term interest rates down to about 5 percent, but in doing so they often expose their principal to risk. Your Money.  [ 34. ]   A ""magic wheel,"" which expands and contracts and looks something like a circular accordion, has been patented by a professor of mechanical engineering.

The company does not plan to produce this more expensive fuel unless it is ordered to, but since it is certain to be ordered to do something, it clearly wants to take the initiative.    Later this year California is expected to issue new fuel regulations, and the oil company's announcement is apparently an effort to shape those rules and head off requirements that would be more difficult for the company to meet."

Now armies of police lie in wait for motorists who do it, bringing fat revenues to the states and to insurance and radar-detector companies. But the economic rationale for the 55 m.p.h. limit no longer exists nor do valid safety grounds. It's time to raise the speed limit.    In 1973, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries created a temporary, artificial oil shortage worldwide. As people panicked on long gas lines, Congress ordered a maximum national speed limit of 55 miles per hour. Billions in Federal highway funds would be cut off to states that defied it. This ""temporary"" measure, billed as a fuel-efficiency move, became permanent in 1975. But it has produced mass civil disobedience, engendering contempt on the part of citizens that resembles nothing so much as their reaction to the Volstead Act and Prohibition."

Maatman says an insurance agent should be more than someone who takes your money, issues you a policy and occasionally pays a claim. To succeed in today's cutthroat environment, Mr. Maatman says, insurers will have to be actively involved in helping policyholders reduce losses.    Now, Mr. Maatman will get a chance to test his theory. Yesterday, the Kemper National Insurance Companies, the Long Grove, Ill., insurer group for which Mr. Maatman has served as president and chief executive, gave him the added title of chairman, effective with the retirement next February of Joseph E. Luecke, who is 64. It will thus fall to Mr. Maatman, 61, to chart the future of the nation's 16th-largest insurer."

After a lull, new funds seem to be on the rise again, with 211 entries through May of this year, already outstripping the total for all of 1990.   This may seem to be bad news to investors, who are already struggling to sort out the hundreds of varieties of funds out there. Yet the recent flurry shouldn't create too much 1/3 1/5 #usion. Many of the new funds are ""dual-class"" clones, that is, they are identical funds with different pricing strategies. Others are versions of existing types of funds offered by banks eager to share in the profitable fund business."

But in the view of a surprisingly broad spectrum of Western analysts, he left the economic summit with his glass one-quarter full, not three-quarters empty.    Those who think loans to Moscow would be a waste of money, or worse, interpret the vaguely worded offer of technical assistance, expanded trade and ""special association"" with international lending agencies as a very polite and constructive brush-off. They expect it will force President Gorbachev to face up to economic realities he has, in their view, been ducking since he rose to power."
