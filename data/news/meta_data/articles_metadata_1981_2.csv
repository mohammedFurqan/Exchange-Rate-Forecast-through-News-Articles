A Cabinet-level auto task force had considered tax and import relief as well but took no specific actions because of disagreements. The industry immediately hailed the regulatory changes. (Page A1.)   House Democrats proposed a $713.5 billion budget for fiscal year 1982, $4 billion less than President Reagan had requested. They also endorsed a smaller tax cut than proposed by the President, urged that the Administration's proposed $50.5 billion deficit be slashed to $24.6 billion and projected a balanced budget by fiscal 1983.

Schaeberle accounced the marriage last week of his company, Nabisco Inc., and Standard Brands Inc., he termed it ''a merger in every sense of the word.''   But, without elaboration, Nabisco's chairman and chief executive officer then added that both companies ''will maintain their separate identities,'' a notion that F. Ross Johnson, his counterpart at Standard Brands, seconded. Both organizations ''will remain intact,'' Mr. Johnson said.   That left management specialists wondering what Mr. Schaeberle and Mr. Johnson had in mind for Nabisco Brands Inc., the new successor company. Many, however, say that the intention is evident: to fashion a more efficient and streamined organization than either could build alone."

In an interview, the official said Administration planners had become increasingly worried that the behavior of the markets would cause members of Congress to have second thoughts about voting for Mr. Reagan's tax program, despite the momentum created by the President's recent victories.   The official also said that recent disarray in the markets had shown some Reagan aides that Wall Street was afraid that tax cuts would widen the budget deficit, contributing to the fear of inflation. As a result, he said, the Administration was more willing to compromise on the size of the tax cut.   The Administration was also taking steps to make additional spending cuts this year as a way of convincing the markets that President Reagan was adamant about controlling deficits, he said. The decision to announce a series of Social Security cutbacks this week, he said, was in part spurred by the need to counter problems in the markets."

Senior American officials said Mr. Weinberger gave the Defense Ministers a graphic and detailed intelligence briefing on the Soviet military buildup in and around Poland and presented a sweeping analysis of the steady growth in Soviet nuclear and conventional arms.   On his first trip to Europe in his new position, the Secretary described a new mood among Americans on national defense and outlined the Administration's plans for rearming America, the official said.  Finally, he laid out his message for the Europeans."

The nation's leaders expected the Reagan Administration to resume military assistance suspended since 1977 and otherwise deal more sympathetically with them.   United States law prohibits arms aid to countries guilt of continuous violations of human rights. In Guatemala, there have been more than 5,000 killings of people in opinion-making positions since 1978, decimating university faculties, moderate and left-of-center political organizations and other groups. There have been no arrests or investigations."

The spokesman, Maj. Gen. Mohsen Hamdi, said that an investigation was under way into the crash, which occurred as the plane was making its approach to the Cairo-West air base shortly after midnight. (The bodies were flown tonight to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, according to The Associated Press.)   In operations of this kind it is ''normal and acceptable'' that losses occur, the Egyptian general said.  He dismissed suggestions that the American pilot's lack of familiarity with the local terrain might have been the cause.  The plane was taking part in a two-day airlift in which 1,400 members of the Rapid Deployment Force and their equipment have been ferried to Egypt's largest air base from Fort Benning, Ga. The airlift was completed this morning a few hours after the crash."

This is done through its appointments, its first measures, usually symbolic, and its first words. These, in different ways, are all signs. Through them the Government says what it would like to be, as opposed to its campaign version of what it thinks the voters would like it to be or what reality will compel it to be in the future.   The most conspicuous thing, a week after Francois Mitterrand became the first Socialist President of the Fifth Republic, is cheerful confusion and unsettled dust. The Minister of Environment cannot find a place for his offices, and there seem to be two, or possibly three, official presidential press representatives and a host of unofficial ones. Newly important people are unexpectedly free for lunch, not because they have nothing to do but because they have so much that it is stuck on its way up to them."

Brazilian officials have categorically denied all aspects of the narrative, but doubts persist because of the habit of Brazil's rulers of conducting the country's affairs in secret and the history of Brazil's acceding to pressure from Iraq, its principal oil supplier until the war with Iran cut the flow.   The episode has proved embarrassing to Brazil because its highly pragmatic foreign policy labors to keep the country out of superpower struggles or political entanglements that could impede pursuit of its own interests.   Brazil, a country eager to be considered stable and reliable, is also portrayed in the account as trying to dodge international nuclear safeguards."

Like the ceremony last week for Robert Sands, the first I.R.A. man to die in the fast for political status in prison, the funeral procession this afternoon to a country churchyard in this peaceful little village 25 miles west of Belfast was accompanied by masked paramilitary commandos in battle dress.   Just outside the Hughes family home, which is two miles from the church, they fired three ceremonial volleys of rifle shots over the coffin, which was draped in the green, yellow and orange flag of the Irish republic.   The tense military mood - set not only by the hard-looking young men with their masks and guns but also by four British Army helicopters that clattered overhead - contrasted harshly with the peaceful, sun-soaked countryside, a picture-postcard land of ancient stone cottages with thatched roofs and gentle green meadows grazed by fat lazy sheep."

The Ayatollah demanded that the President broadcast an apology to the Iranian people for calling on them last week to resist the clergy-dominated Government.   The President responded with one letter pledging loyalty to the revolutionary leader but complaining that he had been treated unfairly, then sent a second defending himself against charges that he had violated the Constitution by refusing to sign a bill empowering the Government to fill Cabinet vacancies and complaining that his first letter had not been broadcast.   It was not clear what the next step would be in the running battle between the dominant Islamic fundamentalists and the President, who has been stripped of virtually all power."

Such pressures have already provoked price reductions or elimination of special surcharges by Kuwait, Iraq and Egypt.   Companies discuss the accelerating moves in only the most guarded terms for fear of angering foreign suppliers. But they privately concede that the moves are prompted by the current glut of world oil, which in turn has led to painful losses by almost every refinery in the world. It is routine for companies to lose $3 or more on every barrel of oil processed in the present market, although many companies are still posting profits from their drilling operations.."

Botha's National Party was maintaining its overwhelming dominance in Parliament early today in the all-white general election despite significant defections by Afrikaner voters to extremist parties that accuse the National Party of endangering white rule.   With roughly 1.2 million voters setting the political course for this nation of 28 million, the governing party found its margins of victory narrowing in rural districts in the Transvaal and Cape provinces where it had not been seriously challenged in recent elections.   But its only loss of seats came in urban areas at the hands of the relatively liberal Progressive Federal Party, which took National Party seats in Capetown and Pietermaritzburg. The Capetown seat was lost by the Minister of Industries, Dawie de Villiers, the first Cabinet member to be defeated since the National Party came to power in 1948."

This optimism, however, was tempered by a call by several deputies of Kuwait's National Assembly to impose another oil embargo against the United States, and suggestions by various Middle East experts that Saudi Arabia may have been angered by Israeli violation of its airspace during the flight to Iraq by the Israeli jets that carried out the attack..   ''I know for a fact that it's going to upset them,'' said David Toufic Mizrahi, editor of MidEast Report, which is published in New York.   The issue could be decided as early as Friday when Arab foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Baghdad to discuss the situation.  ''We're still awful, awful vulnerable even though we think we're in good shape,'' said a top official of one of the world's biggest oil companies. Moreover, United States intelligence officials have not ruled out the possibility of an Arab oil embargo."

The warning came from Dr. James B.

The agency now has a trigger that makes emergency oil-sharing mandatory when its members experience a 7 percent reduction in supplies. But it was suspended at the request of some major members during oil cutoffs brought on by the Iran-Iraq war last year."

Haig Jr. leaving tonight on a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, the American military relationship with Saudi Arabia and Israel has become complicated by a possible arms race that seems to have been inadvertently set off by an American desire to build up Saudi defenses against any Soviet threat.   Mr. Haig conferred with President Reagan at George Washington University Hospital this morning and received last-minute messages for the leaders he will meet on the trip.   Mr. Haig will spend one day each in Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. On Wednesday he will fly to Spain with a stop in Italy.

The weekly auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills, which averaged 13.91 percent and 13.62 percent, respectively, was the latest sign of the widely anticipated decline in short-term rates.  By accepting a lower yield for three-and six-month bills than could be earned in shorter-term money market instruments, investors and traders were showing that they did not expect the higher yields on the shorter maturities to last long.   Yesterday, for example, the institutional investor's return on new Treasury bills was well below the 18 5/8 percent that could have been earned on an overnight loan in the Federal funds market, and was also less than the 16 1/2 to 17 percent yield available on one-month issues of commercial paper or negotiable bank certificates of deposit."

One trader called it a ''nervous spasm,'' but it was nevertheless strong enough to raise some long-term bond prices more than 2 1/2 points.   Most analysts attributed the rebound, which also reduced some Treasury bill rates by about a quarter of a percentage point, to technical factors, such as short covering by speculators. In the financial futures markets, where speculative positions can be taken with very little cash, the anticipation of a drop in rates from current high levels was great enough to lift prices sharply for Treasury bill and bond contracts."

In one sense, the striking workers hunched over barrels of burning wood scraps outside the factory entrance and the silent machinery inside constituted just another statistic in Britain's long history of acrimonious labor relations.   But on a broader level, the stoppage, a scene repeated countless times across Britain, was apparently a consequence of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's efforts to improve economic performance in Britain, until now a home of low productivity and high propensity to strike.   Her conservative economic philosophy has pressed companies like Ford to insist on more efficiency, and workers like these to acquiesce. Mrs. Thatcher's critics see broader results of her policies, particularly her tight control of the money supply: a neardepression that has left two and a half million Britons unemployed and left British companies virtually without profits."

The amendment would require that President Reagan certify, in two semiannual reports to the Speaker of the House, that the Government of El Salvador is not engaged in a consistent pattern of violations of human rights and is achieving substantial control over all elements of its armed forces so as ''to bring to an end the indiscriminate torture and murder of Salvadoran citizens by these forces.''"

American and British military analysts say they believe such a drive could begin in the next few weeks. British sources put the size of the Iraqi force at 60,000 men and 1,000 tanks. These figures, analysts say, may be inflated, but they report signs that Baghdad is stressing that Abadan must be taken.   The Iraqis hold large parts of Iran's oil-producing province of Khuzistan, with the occupied territory varying from 19 to 37 miles in depth. But analysts point out that the strategic objective of Iraq's drive into Iran - control over the Shatt al Arab - cannot be achieved as long as Iranian guns in Abadan can command the waterway, which separates the two countries at the head of the Persian Gulf."

Thomas G. Hardy and Robert A. Schmitz, principals at McKinsey, believe many executives in the United States are unaware of the ways inflation has altered the rules of business. Mr. Hardy, 36 years old, and Mr. Schmitz, 39, have discussed managing in an inflationary economy with the 200 executives in periodic seminars. Mr. Hardy was interviewed recently.   Q. How does inflation change fundamental business operations? A. It changes the way you make money. While profits from running the business remain critical, gains from appreciating assets and from the use of debt are important. You also need more cash to finance working capital and to replace working capital. There is also a risk of a cash squeeze."

There were only two signs of discord at places he visited during the trip - a sign hanging from a dormitory at the College of William and Mary saying ''Free Sands'' and a crowd outside the White House last night chanting ''Bobby Sands, Bobby Sands, Bobby Sands.'' Mr.  Sands is in the 64th day of a hunger strike at a prison outside Belfast, Northern Ireland, demanding status as a political prisoner."

Last week, while the agreement was still pending, Government spokesmen in Vienna denied reports that the sale was imminent. Some Austrian labor leaders, legislators and youth groups said, however, that they would seek to block it because of the human rights record of the Argentine military regime. The 57 tanks were originally part of an order of 100 tanks for Chile, but that order was canceled last year after similar objections were raised.

Now with the season almost spent in 98-degree temperatures, the land is parched and inhospitable to agriculture.   For most farmers, the land will become useful again only in July, weeks after the rains set in to soften the soil. They will then sow rice and corn and grow them while the rains last. In four months, they will harvest the only crop for the year."

The rise in the index of leading economic indicators was the second straight following three monthly declines.   The result, substantially in line with expectations, confirmed the views of many analysts that the economy would continue to push ahead into the summer but at a considerably slower rate than it did during the first quarter, when the nation's output of goods and services grew at an exceptionally robust annual rate of 8.4 percent."

The problem, as seen by the associate of the Chancellor, who flew home Friday from talks in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, was that judgments would be made not only by Saudis and Israelis but also by Americans and Russians.   On Tuesday, when Mr. Schmidt announced in Riyadh that a weapons sale to Saudi Arabia was ''not feasible at this time,'' the associate was reminded of the earlier remark and asked what he thought the reaction would be in those places where West Germany wanted to maintain its influence.   The answer, in a sense, was a recognition of concern that Mr.  Schmidt might be seen as a man so weakened over the last six months that he could not do all he seemed capable of from 1977 until after his re-election last fall."

Whereas a decade or so ago many planners felt that downtown areas had to compete with their suburban counterparts - the regional shopping centers - and create enclosed malls to invite off-street strolling and capture something of the spirit of congregation, the planning pendulum is swinging again.   High-rise towers with gallerias, atria and arcades proliferated in recent years, but these ''covered pedestrian spaces,'' which gave developers a zoning bonus of more building bulk, were often not noticed and unsuccessful.   Many planners are now advocating the supremacy of the street and the need to reinforce its environment for pedestrians. The city's draft revision of midtown zoning proposes to eliminate many of the bonuses for certain ''public amenities'' and mandates, in many instances, street-level retail uses."

This conclusion, intelligence officials said, is based on Iraq's ambitious nuclear program, which they described as far exceeding either the Iraqis' power requirements or programs aimed at commercial use. But the conclusion is questioned by some Administration and Congressional quarters.   Concern about Iraq's nuclear capabilities has grown recently, the officials said, in light of intelligence reports that Baghdad has been negotiating with an Italian company to purchase a small reprocessing plant. In addition, the officials said that Italy had been training Iraqi technicians and scientists in reprocessing technology, which could be used to separate plutonium as a weapons material, a development that generated intense concern in Israel."

The majors are said to be retrenching and the independents falling by the wayside. And the reasons are legion: the skyrocketing costs of talent, production, promotion and distribution; the percentage of profits consumed by the rising prime rate; the impending directors' strike; the attrition rate of quality motion pictures; and the difficulty of closing favorable distribution deals and of collecting the agreed-upon share of box office receipts.   Having considered all that, CBS Inc. wants in. It wants to be a star, a studio to rival the long-established Hollywood majors - even though it phased out its last feature-film venture at a loss. It wants to produce movies that, far from being film fodder, will succeed at the box office and sell year after year on video cassettes and videodisks."

Although the dollar eased in later New York trading, the strong showing in Europe raised widespread fears among European bankers and monetary officials that other countries would also be forced to increase rates to defend their currencies against the dollar, further depressing Europe's recession-gripped economy and creating more unemployment.   Contributing to those fears, France's central bank today raised its discount rate for seven-day Treasury bills a full percentage point, to 13.5 percent, in an effort to bolster the sagging franc. The franc has been depressed by the fast-climbing dollar and fears that President Valery Giscard d'Estaing may lose next Sunday's Presidential election to his Socialist opponent, Francois Mitterrand."

Discussions of possible military developments have increased in the last 48 hours because both diplomatic and military sources believe there has been a worsening of the situation. The Soviet Union, it is said, has reached the point where it cannot ignore further Polish defiance and where it must weigh the pros and cons of military action.   An important element in Soviet planning, an Atlantic alliance source said, must be the evaluation of the loyalties of the Polish Army and Air Force in the event of an intervention. The consensus among Western experts is that, with the exception of a small number of senior officers, the ground and air forces would resist Soviet military intervention."

Treading a thin line between resistance and compromise, he prevailed - through Stalinist incarceration and the persecution of the faithful, through the harassment that followed, through Communist efforts to legislate the church into submission, through the downfall of a succession of discredited party and Government chiefs.  In the end, an officially atheist regime had to turn to him and his bishops for rescue from a citizenry enraged by economic hardships as well as by official corruption and ineptitude.   In the labor unrest starting last year, Cardinal Wyszynski became the arbitrator between between the leaders of the independent labor movement and the Communist Party leadership. Right to Be a Catholic Nation   ''After 10 centuries of Catholicism,'' he had reminded Poland's political leaders long before, in 1966, ''we have the right to be a Catholic nation, and we do not resign that right.'' Responding to cheers from hundreds of thousands of pilgrims in Upper Silesia, he used that show of support to plead for co-existence between the Church and ''the authority of Caesar.''"

In 1978, when the idea of tanning booth franchises was first marketed with vigor, the enterprise looked like an entrepreneur's dream. In two minutes, for a few dollars a visit, the public would get brown. And seemingly, for a franchise fee of $7,000 to $30,000, a few strips of plywood, some goggles, some ultraviolet tanning bulbs and a supply of reflective paper, the entrepreneurs needed only to wait for the profits to roll in."

The three-man commission also accused the Government of President Rodrigo Carazo Odio of covering up its involvement in the regional arms traffic and of trying to block the 11-month-long congressional investigation.   The 73-page report, which was issued yesterday, has added to the widespread disenchantment with President Carazo, whose management of the economy and foreign policy has come under mounting criticism from both opposition parties and his former supporters.   Almost all Costa Ricans cheered on the Sandinist guerrillas in their struggle to overthrow Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle two years ago. They condoned the fact that Costa Rican territory was being used by the guerrillas as a propaganda base, for military training and as a conduit for weapons being supplied to them by the Governments of Panama, Venezuela and Cuba."

Before that move, these thrift institutions were attempting to sell savings certificates with maturities of up to 10 years. And they had begun to extend the average maturity of their deposits. Since the advent of the six-month certificates, the thrift institutions have sold close to $100 billion of them, but not without some troubling consequences. As a result of the large amounts of money flowing into the thrift institutions, this inflationary effect drove the national average price of a home up close to 100 percent, and as savers closed out passbook accounts and put the money into the new certificates, this more than doubled interest payments on deposits and put a tremendous squeeze on the thrifts' profits."

One phrase is the slogan on a Socialist poster: ''Change? Or 14 Years of Giscard?'' The other was heard all over town today; for instance, in a statement by Roger Chinaud, an aide to Mr. Giscard d'Estaing: ''If Mitterrand is elected he will need the presence of Communists in his government.''   The two phrases suggest why the May 10 runoff election between the two largest vote-getters yesterday offers a crucial test of the French Fifth Republic.   The institution erected by Charles de Gaulle - a presidency with a seven-year term and powers unequaled in any other democratic Western nation - was designed to give strong government to a France weakened by continual political crisis."

RULE AND LENS CLEANERS,"  The introduction of the soft contact lens more than a decade ago proved a boon to the companies that made them. And like lots of other new products, the soft contact lens was a boon as well to ancillary industries - in this case, the business of helping wearers to clean their thin little shells of plastic.   One manufacturer, Burton, Parsons & Company of Seat Pleasant, Md., did especially well. The company produced a sterilized saline solution, the only such product approved by the Food and Drug Administration in l978. In that year, the F.D.A. banned less costly salt tablets that lens-wearers had mixed with water to make their own cleansing solutions. The F.D.A.'s concern was directed at users who might not have used the distilled water specified, causing harm to their eyes."

In three days of talks and carefully worded public statements, Mr.  Haig demonstrated to the Chinese that the Reagan Administration could be sensitive to their internal political concerns.

But just right now, the lid is popping off at American Can. After years of comfortable profits, earnings plummeted 33 percent last year. And in a Brooklyn Federal court earlier this month, a jury found one of American Can's units, Sam Goody Inc., guilty of dealing in thousands of counterfeit tapes of popular music."

The ''white paper'' on El Salvador, issued Feb. 23, formed part of a major diplomatic effort by the Reagan Administration accusing the Soviet Union and Cuba of supporting left-wing subversion in Central America and justifying United States military aid to the militarybacked civilian Government of El Salvador.   The State Department, reaffirming its findings of external Communist political and arms support, based on captured guerrilla documents and other intelligence information, said that a ''few points of misstated detail or ambiguous formulations'' in the report did not invalidate the conclusions about Communist intervention."

Like 70 percent of the capial's two and a half inhabitants, Hasan lives in one of the bleak squatters' houses called gecekondus, or night houses, that have sprouted all over the hills around Ankara.   Hasan, who would rather not mention his last name, is from the village of Otaci, 45 miles west of Ankara, where his father has a small farm producing wheat, vegetables and a few cows.  The boy came to Ankara because he was ""bored"" with farm life and also because it is the tradition for village boys to go off to the city and seek a better life."

In the process of revolutionizing the way meat is butchered and packaged, Iowa Beef forced the competition either to copy its methods or quit the business.   Analysts are nearly unanimous that Occidental could not have found a better partner through which to make a major entry into the food industry. The combination of Occidental's money and Iowa Beef's experience is expected to turn the meatpacker into a worldwide processor, not only of beef but of pork products as well."

According to the officials, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin worked out an arrangement last month for senior aides to meet regularly, starting this month and continuing through the summer, in advance of a meeting in late September between Mr. Haig and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.   Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, will conduct the discussions with Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the No. 2 diplomat at the Soviet Embassy.  Mr. Eagleburger will be assisted by Richard R. Burt, Director of Politico-Military affairs in the State Department, officials said.   The disclosure that the Russians have agreed to the arrangement is the first indication that Moscow has apparently accepted the Reagan Administration's timetable for talks, officials said."

In the absence of a good flow of orders from investors, securities dealers said the credit markets were dominated by the increase in the Federal funds rate to 16 1/2 percent during the afternoon. ''The market seemed to focus on the higher funds rate and the large volume of Treasury securities to be sold next week,'' commented Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber Inc. ''Everyone is ignoring signs that would encourage higher bond prices, such as a slowdown in the economy and less inflation.''   In the Treasury bill market the higher funds rate helped increase the average rate for new three-month and six-month bills to about 14.19 percent and 14.04 percent, respectively. Last week the average rates were 13.55 percent for three months and 13.62 percent for six months."

In the money markets, rates were little changed to slightly higher as the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market fluctuated around 15 5/8 percent.

Since the death of Mao in 1976, the party has been trying to restore its prestige among a population of one billion people brutalized by radical policies in Communist engineering. So far it has had little success, and it has been forced to argue that despite ''serious mistakes'' in the past, it remains the only force in China powerful enough to prevent Balkanization and a return to feudalism.   In preparing for festivities on July 1, the party-controlled press has dwelt on the glories and victories of the struggle against foreign oppression in the period before it came to power in 1949. It has eulogized the early optimistic years of its rule and glossed over the era since 1957 in which China mostly stagnated behind a wall of propaganda that made many in the outside world think of it as a utopia."

J.G. Strijdom, who died in 1958, would undoubtedly twirl in his grave if he could contemplate the degree to which the South African racial system has been set aside in a territory that he regarded as just another South African province. So would Hendrik F. Verwoerd, his successor, who is memorialized in a small park a few steps from the hotel at which the Americans stayed.   But the homage that is still paid to their memory is one of numerous signs - a military presence of roughly 20,000 troops is another - that South Africa remains the de facto colonial power in this vast, arid land that it took from Imperial Germany in World War I and later received, after the fact of conquest, as a mandate from the League of Nations."

Mr. Armstrong will not breathe a word about the President's money, but he will talk about the investment strategies that guide the managing of Starwood's $400 million of pension funds and large personal holdings.   Mr. Armstrong, not a large man but one who enjoys a large reputation on Wall Street, apparently impressed Justin W. Dart, chairman of Dart & Kraft's executive committee and a friend of Mr.  Reagan's, with a presentation before the company's pension committee. He doesn't speak as an adviser to small investors, rather, as a pension fund manager who buys and sells big blocks of stock, the kind of trading that has come to dominate Wall Street and, he admits, has added to its frustrating volatility.   ''We feel the stock market is in a very favorable position to grow over the next five years,'' the 55-year-old president of Starwood said in a lengthy interview. ''But that doesn't say much about the next five months. If you can take a lot of turbulence for several months, you can probably make a lot of money in stocks.''"

MARTIN, the first woman chairman of the American Advertising Federation, who takes office June 8, is arriving at a time when that grass roots organization is becoming more important to the advertising industry than it has ever been.   With the cutback of Federal regulation under the Reagan Administration, the A.A.F. now expects cities and states to fill the void in regulating and taxing advertising, thus enhancing the role that the federation will play, she said the other day.   And as important as they are in the industry, the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers are not in a position to monitor such activities. But the A.A.F., with some 25,000 members belonging to 203 clubs in all 50 states, will be able to hoist the early warning signals, catch early legislative activity before trends start and then mount counterattacks."

Load management also minimizes the use of the units that generate the most expensive power, which saves consumers money."

With five-sixths of the returns in, the Minister of the Interior, Christian Bonnet, announced that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing was leading with about 28.2 percent of the vote and that Mr. Mitterrand's share stood at 26.2 percent.   Though the President's showing was not as bad as his supporters had feared, his slim lead confirmed his decline in the last few weeks.  Mr. Mitterrand, on the other hand, did unexpectedly well.   The vote, which eliminated eight other contenders, was too close to permit any predictions about the May 10 runoff between the two finalists.

Since April 29, when Syria first moved batteries of antiaircraft missiles into Lebanon, Israel's stake in a political solution has grown, and the alternative of military action, which at first seemed such a decisive, conclusive answer, has developed serious liabilities. Military Force Is Not Ruled Out   The shift in perception is not absolute and does not rule out armed force should diplomatic efforts fail. But Mr. Habib's two weeks in the region have provided a cooling-off period, time for Syria to reinforce its defenses and a chance for the Israelis to analyze and define more sharply their security interests across their northern border."

By doing so, they were able to recover a major portion of the capital they had invested in the land while leasing it at reasonably attractive long-term fixed rates.   They also contracted to pay the new landowner a portion of incremental rents over the years. When the contracts were initiated, this seemed like a good deal for all parties concerned."

There he was thrown together with another political commissar, 11 years his senior, named Deng Xiaoping.   It was the beginning of a long friendship between Mr. Hu and Mr.  Deng, now China's predominant leader.  From the early 1940's on, the career of Mr. Hu - his name is pronounced hoo yaow-bahng - has closely paralleled that of Mr. Deng.  They served together in the army for eight years. They marched south into Sichuan Province and worked in the local administration there at the outset of the People's Republic in 1949. They were transferred concurrently to Peking in 1952. And when Mr. Deng was purged in the Cultural Revolution as a ''capitalist roader,'' Mr. Hu was toppled along with him, attacked by Red Guards as a member of Mr. Deng's ''club.'' It was a pattern that was to be repeated in 1976 when Mr.  Deng was disgraced for a second time."

Alberta wants to raise its oil prices closer to world price levels at a pace faster than the federal Government is willing to permit. The wellhead price of domestic crude is now $17.75 (Canadian) a barrel, about half the world price. A Canadian dollar is worth about 83 cents in United States currency."

This represents a cut of $43.8 billion below the Carter Administration's proposed budget for that year. But the Reagan budget figures are clearly wrong, even before the first Congressional budget resolution has been printed. Virtually no informed person in Congress or the White House believes that spending in the fiscal year 1982 will be anywhere near that low.   Next month the appropriations committees of Congress will start to wrestle with producing agency totals that stay within the $695.5 billion ceiling - a task made impossible by prices and interest rates that are higher than the Administration or Congress had assumed."

Plan,"  ONE of the greatest intellectual achievements of the 20th century is game theory, developed by the mathematician John von Neumann in 1928 and extended to economics by Dr. von Neumann and the economist Oskar Morgenstern in their classic, ''The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior'' (1944).   Game theory, a mathematical system for analyzing contests where opponents seek to outwit each other and design the best course of action under all circumstances, has had a steadily growing influence in fields as diverse as warfare, arms control, politics, business and the humanities.   The current contest between Republicans and Democrats in Congress over President Reagan's economic program poses a challenge for game theory. The Democrats have two basic strategies: (I) mainly support the Reagan program or (II) attack the Reagan program and present a tax and spending program of their own. The Republicans also must choose between two strategies: (A) fully defend the President's program or (B) compromise with the Democrats, who have a majority in the House (if they hang together)."

Both in private conversations and at a news conference, Mr. Haig's principal aim appeared to be to disabuse Spaniards of the impression, widespread here since the attempted military coup on Feb. 23, that the Reagan Administration was lukewarm in its support of Spanish democracy.   This impression had grown from an off-the-cuff remark the Secretary made shortly after Parliament was seized that what was occurring in Spain was ''an internal matter.'' Though the Reagan Administration sent messages of congratulation to the King and Mr. Calvo Sotelo after the coup collapsed, the Spanish press interpreted Mr. Haig's comment as a sign of indifference and, in some publications, as proof that Washington knew of the coup attempt in advance."

Under this unpublished agreement, France was to have kept scientists working at the French-built reactor outside of Baghdad until 1989. The scientists were authorized to watch all nuclear experiments that Iraq carried out at the reactor and to check afterward to insure that it was still functioning safely.   In Washington today, Under Secretary of State Walter J. Stoessel Jr. said that although the Reagan Administration had been concerned about Iraq's nuclear program, it would not agree with Israel's assertion that the reactor destroyed near Baghdad was designed to produce nuclear weapons.

UP STRONGLY FOR FIRST QUARTER AT 6.5% YEARLY RATE,"  The nation's economy grew in the first quarter of 1981 at an annual rate of 6.5 percent, a figure that was higher than most economists had expected.   The economists divided over the impact of the figure, with some saying that the strong growth would damage chances for Congressional passage of the Administration's proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent annually for three years. The tax cut is designed to stimulate economic growth.   The advance in the ''real'' gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services adjusted for inflation, was the biggest quarterly gain since the second quarter of 1978 and compared with an annual growth rate of just 3.8 percent in 1980's fourth quarter."

Hastily erected by the tottering regime of Fulgencio Batista days before his overthrow in 1959, it is a symbol of the ambivalence with which religion exists under the Communist Government of Fidel Castro.    While the ''Christ of Havana,'' as it is known, has never been removed, it strikes an uncomfortable image standing over a harbor busy with Soviet ships loading and unloading cargo.   It is both a rebuke to the state's atheistic doctrine and something of an embarrassement to many Christians, who see it as a reminder of a bygone era and a cause of tension between Communists and Christians.

Even efforts last week by the Democratic leadership, including Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski and Speaker of the House Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., to persuade business to back their version of business tax relief do not appear to have won many converts. Big business has lined up solidly with the Reagan plan, which centers on depreciating plant and equipment.   Representatives of small business, though more interested in the new proposal, did not seem to be fighting for it although they said the plan would probably benefit them."

President Reagan proposed the levies, which are called users' fees, and said they would pay for part of the services of the Coast Guard, whose duties include looking after boaters. The proposal has met some heavy opposition.   Darrell Trent, Deputy Secretary of Transportation, told a House subcommittee hearing last month: ''The reasons for this policy are twofold, equity and efficiency. Those who obtain valuable services from the Government or use Government-funded facilities should pay for them. Those who do not should not be asked to share the cost.''"

This state of affairs is reminiscent of the frothy days of the late 1960's leading up to the debacle of the early 1970's when the stock market experienced its worst setback since the crash.   Investors would do well to reaffirm the twin goals of money management: preserve purchasing power, that is, seek gains equal to or in excess of inflation, but not if safety of principal must be sacrificed.   A money management firm in Boston called Atlantic Financial Management feels so strongly about the capital preservation aspect of the equation that the company's assets have twice been withdrawn from the market completely and placed in money market instruments to ride out an anticipated storm."

More than 300 yards of a double-bore tunnel had already been dug.

In that range, the new subcompacts - Chevrolet Cavalier and the Pontiac J2000 - are priced just below comparably equipped models of G.M.'s larger ''X'' cars, although a stripped-down ''X'' car would cost less than the new ''J'' cars.

The carpeted corridors of Bermuda's largest hotel, which had expected to be filled with 1,200 visitors by now, are ghostly and deserted.   But in the streets outside the post office, in front of the hospital, at the airport and elsewhere, striking workers move silently in picket lines under the watchful eyes of the police. ''No law is going to make economic slaves out of us,'' proclaimed a sign carried by a striking telephone company worker. ''If a man has to work three jobs just to survive, he's a slave,'' said the man grimly.    The strike, which Bermuda's Prime Minister, David Gibbons, has denounced as ''illegal, irresponsible and reprehensible,'' began more than three weeks ago when several groups of government employees were unable to reach agreement with the Government on a wage increase."

What high officials describe as Mr. Reagan's ''very measured response'' reflects Washington's basic political and diplomatic quandary - how to balance American understanding of Israel's anxiety about a potential nuclear threat with Washington's need to protect its own credibility and influence in the Middle East, as well as to control its own arms sales policies.   By suspending the scheduled shipment of four F-16 aircraft to Israel and reporting to Congress that the Israeli raid may have constituted ''substantial violation'' of the 1952 American-Israeli arms agreement, Mr. Reagan has put the Israelis on notice that they cannot expect a blank check when American interests in the region are so vividly at stake. Far Short of '75 Action   But by merely suspending this one arms shipment ''for the time being'' the President has stopped far short of the kind of arms embargo that was invoked by Congress against Turkey in 1975.

Experts envision that robots will eventually move from industry to the home, as the computer is doing.   An affordable robot that can do household chores is at least five and probably 20 years away. But a variety of entrepreneurs and tinkerers are already trying to get into the business and scores of hobbyists are experimenting with their own robots."

It worked, it was full of big game and fine lodges, and so it was fun to visit. It encouraged free enterprise, kept its human rights record fairly clean and, from the Western point of view, won high marks for shunning Soviet influence and retaining a devout commitment to capitalism.   None of this has changed. However, something has gone wrong in Kenya, and it seems to be on the mind of most of the people who live here. Tribalism has a lot to do with it, as well as mismanagement and poor development planning. The trouble has its roots in the presidency of Jomo Kenyatta, who led Kenya to independence in 1963 and who was President from 1964 until his death in 1978.   Mr. Kenyatta was a Kikuyu. The Kikuyu are the most populous of the 13 major tribes in Kenya. The one political party, the Kenya African National Union, over the years essentially became the Kikuyu party.  Although the Vice President was always a non-Kikuyu, it was no secret that the more powerful jobs and the better development projects went mostly to the Kikuyu during the Kenyatta days."

''In 1978 and 1979 we scrapped a half million tons of capacity and we are now operating (industry-wide) at 60 percent of the 1.1 million ton capacity,'' said Tatsuro Oya of the economic research department of Sumitomo Light Metal Industries. ''This was partly due to depressed demand but mainly due to the flood of imports.''   American producers sent their share of total Japanese aluminum imports to 36.5 percent last year, up from 15 percent in 1979 and only 5.8 percent of total imports by Japan in 1978. In the fiscal year that ended March 31, 1980, Japan imported about 300,000 tons of aluminum ingots and semifabricated products from the U.S., more than three times the volume of the previous year."

The officials in charge of finding a new policy for the Reagan Administration say the Carter Administration's approach was not working, so they had to try a new one. The Carter policy was to threaten South Africa with sanctions so it would agree to relinquish its administration of South-West Africa, and then to try to persuade Angola to send home the 20,000 Cuban troops stationed there.   The Reagan approach, outlined in a memorandum that became public this week, essentially would reverse the steps in order to keep movement towards settlement on both issues in parallel. But officials know they are playing a long shot, because of deep-seated problems both here and in Africa."

The October report of a ''broadly based'' expansion of factory, mine and utility output appears to support expectations that the economy will ring up in the fourth quarter a stronger advance than in the third, when business picked up by a bare 1 percent at annual rates. There was also good news in the figures for unemployment insurance, where initial claims have been declining.   Nevertheless, there were warnings from economists that the outlook was uncertain and that by early 1981 the recovery from the short 1980 business recession could be decidedly sluggish, as widely forecast.  Citing the upward thrust of interest rates since September, Otto Eckstein, president of Data Resources Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., economic consulting firm, said that the first or second quarter of 1981 ''could easily be a minus.''"

In the 1960's, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the metropolitan airports, forecast growth for the Newark field that has not been approached, much less attained. It estimated that the number of passengers annually would explode to 18 million or 19 million by 1980. To handle the growth it envisioned, the authority built a $400 million complex - Terminals A and B - in the southern part of the field. Today, they easily accommodate passengers using Newark. For while Newark now is growing faster than La Guardia Airport or Kennedy International Airport, last year's passenger traffic at Newark reached only 9.2 million. Terminal C, with its shell completed in 1973, was mothballed. The authority says that construction of that terminal, originally planned as an international arrivals center, is now scheduled to resume in January 1983."

The officials say they believe that key black-ruled African countries will have no choice but to go along.   According to documents made available to The New York Times and interviews with Administration officials, the strategy includes these elements:   - South Africa's ''major concerns'' are to be met, including improved relations with Washington, as the only way of inducing that country to give up control of South-West Africa, or Namibia, but actual consummation of the agreement is to be held off.   The prospect of getting South African troops out of Namibia, from which they have been attacking guerrilla forces based in Angola, is to be used as leverage on the Soviet-backed Government of Angola.   Angola is to be asked both to obtain a withdrawal of Cuban forces from its territory and to share power within Angola with Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Western-backed Union for the Total Independence of Angola."

It was the beginning of an undertaking that in that short time has made Brazil the world's largest exporter of chicken, with projected sales in 1981 of 260,000 tons, worth $390 million.   The ends of Mr. Quraitem's endeavors have more than forestalled any questions of the means he used to achieve them. ''Fifty percent of Brazil's chicken producers would be bankrupt today if it weren't for what I did,'' said Mr. Quraitem, a 42-year-old naturalized Brazilian, son of a Maltese father and an Italian mother."

Ford's Office of Management and Budget. NEW YORK - The current budget dispute in the Congress involves a high-risk game in which Reagan either may triumph completely, or see his carefully built edifice begin to crumble. The Reagan economic plan hit its first real snags in the budget committees of the Congress. Three Republican senators on the Senate Budget Committee switched sides and precipitated the first major vote against the plan in the Senate. Representative Jim Jones, the Oklahoma Democrat and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has devised an alternative budget that involves less tax cutting than Mr. Reagan desires and lower deficits, while Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is pushing for significant changes in the plan."

They are trying to do everything to block the advance of socialism, to erode it from inside. For that purpose they are using any means, such as economic pressure and blackmail, false propaganda, flattery and demagogy, support and encouragement of counterrevolutionary forces where they still exist, and many other types of subversive activities.   All of this, comrades, you remember from your own experience. It has convincingly shown: the plans of reaction are without prospect.  Similar attempts are now being made with regard to the Polish Peoples Republic. But the Polish Communists, with the support of all genuine patriots of Poland, will be able, one should believe, to give a fitting rebuff to the designs of the enemies of the socialist system who are at the same time the enemies of Poland's independence, will be able to uphold the cause of socialism, the genuine interests of the Polish people, the honor and security of their motherland."

It is uncertain whether the incidents, in which at least 9 people were killed and 59 seriously injured, were a spontaneous outburst of nationalist discontent by the ethnic Albanians who make up most of the province's population or a meticulously planned action to undermine the Yugoslav Government.

About two years ago the Society of Fire Protection Engineers estimated that at least 5,000 fire protection experts would be needed in the next five years, but only about 50 graduated that year with B.S. degrees.   The need has grown, according to Boyd A. Hartley, chairman of the department of fire protection and safety engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology, which has offered a fire protection engineering program since 1903.   ''And the basic problem still remains. High school vocational counselors talk to students about jobs as firemen, but the counselors know little or nothing about fire protection and safety engineering as a career,'' he said."

Deaver, the White House deputy chief of staff, gave President Reagan a memorandum containing the State Department's recommendations for several key ambassadorial appointments. At the bottom of the list was a name Mr. Deaver had himself added: Joseph V. Reed Jr. Mr. Reed, a longtime confidential aide to David Rockefeller, was recommended for appointment as Ambassador to Morocco.   Mr. Reagan approved the appointment along with the others, and pending a routine security check that is now under way, Administration officials say, the 43-year-old aide of the recently retired chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank will be the next American Ambassador in Rabat.   The story of his selection provides insights into how some ambassadors are actually chosen. In theory, under procedures established at the outset of the Reagan Administration, the names of prospective ambassadors reach the President only after careful screening by committees composed of senior officials in the State Department and the White House. In many cases, however, including this one, personal entreaties by politically influential patrons, intercession by a close personal aide to the President and other factors can effectively circumvent the normal bureaucratic process."

For several years, such insurers as Aetna Life and Casualty, the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company and the Prudential Insurance Company of America have been providing the new kind of motorists' protection to a handful of customers in a limited number of states. But the insurers say they expect the demand for group auto policies to increase gradually over the decade as current problems - including unfavorable tax laws, state regulations, and the need to structure the policies to provide economic benefits for employers, employees and insurers - are ironed out.   In contrast to individual automobile policies, group auto is purchased by an employer and the underwriting, generally shared by both employer and employee, depends on the experience of the group over time rather than the driving record of the individual car owner. Since the group premium is averaged, the pace of its upward spiral is dependent on the group's collective driving record."

Weinberger's directive that the Rapid Deployment Force be established as an individual command in 18 months rather than in three to five years reflects the Pentagon's desire to endow American strategy with a mobility and flexibility needed to honor new military commitments. But the emphasis on these new commitments and the major expansion of American military power planned by the Reagan Administration may well increase the difference in power between the United States and its NATO allies and lead to doubts about the solidity of the American resolve in the defense of Western Europe.   A major acceleration in the formation of the force, which in itself represents a change in American strategic thinking, will mean little unless there is a comparable acceleration in the procurement of equipment to move large forces great distances in a short time. Some Pentagon planners also think that the new strategic approach, which embraces southern Africa, Southwest Asia and Latin America, also calls for a re-evaluation of some present weapons programs."

Academic research reactors tend to be smaller than those used for power production. According to Dr. Leon J. Lidofsky, professor of nuclear science and engineering at Columbia University, the designated power of the Iraqi reactor was more like that of the reactor with which India is said to have produced plutonium for its atomic bomb."

''Clearly we're heading back to where we were before the rebates began,'' said Harvey Heinbach, auto analyst for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. ''I don't think we're going to see much of a spark in auto sales until the second half of this year.''

Like a spring tornado, this season's enthusiasm for genetic engineering is sweeping over agriculture, one of America's biggest businesses and the nation's chief export industry.   The signs of a new industry in the making are everywhere. The names are often old-line and the numbers huge - Du Pont, Monsanto, Pfizer, Atlantic Richfield, Stauffer Chemical, Upjohn, Occidental Petroleum, and Ciba-Geigy, among others, are spending tens of millions of dollars to explore the agricultural applications of bio-engineering.   At the smaller end of the corporate spectrum, a swarm of new companies has been spawned. The big three among these pioneers are Advanced Genetics Science Ltd., of Bermuda and Greenwich, Conn., partly owned by Rohm & Haas; the Agrigenetics Corporation, which is building a new laboratory for basic plant research in Madison, Wis., and the International Plant Research Institute in San Carlos, Calif., which with the help of funds from Atlantic Richfield is exploring everything from plants that can grow in salt water to putting animal genes into plants in order to produce meat-like proteins."

He promised that the United States would never accept Soviet intervention in countries such as Afghanistan.

About four million voters, who had rejected Quebec's separation from Canada in a referendum last year, turned around and gave Mr.  Levesque a sweeping show of confidence in his ability to lead Quebec as a Canadian province. Parti Quebecois, which led from the start of the count shortly after the polls closed at 8 P.M., won 80 of the 122 seats at stake in the National Assembly against only 42 for the Liberal Party. In the outgoing assembly, which had 12 fewer seats, Parti Quebecois had 67 seats, the Liberals had 34, Union Nationale had 5, independents had 2 and 2 seats were vacant.   In a northern Montreal sports arena, a huge crowd of Parti Quebecois supporters, who had watched the defeat of their independence dreams in tears 11 months ago, was deliriously happy tonight as the seats piled up for their party. Mr. Levesque has promised voters, however, that he will hold no new referendum on independence during a new term, although he did not rule out an election on the issue before the end of the legal five-year term."

Shad, after little more than a month as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is facing two key decisions that Wall Street and businessmen feel could well set the tone for the future direction of the commission's crucial enforcement division.   In the first place, Mr. Shad must replace Stanley Sporkin, who as head of the division was its most visible symbol until his appointment last month to the post of general counsel for the Central Intelligence Agency.   Mr. Shad, though he has not yet made a final decision on Mr.  Sporkin's replacement, is apparently going to break with recent S.E.C. tradition and appoint as enforcement director an outside lawyer who has never worked for the commission, according to sources familiar with the selection process.   These sources say the leading contenders for Mr. Sporkin's post are three private lawyers: John M. Fedders, a partner in the Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter; Jed S. Rakoff, a partner in the New York firm of Mudge Rose Guthrie & Alexander, and Peter R. Taft, a partner in the Los Angeles firm of Munger, Tolles & Rickershauser."

DISPUTE LOOMS ON INFANT FORMULA,"  A dispute over the sale of artificial milk to third-world countries is likely to break out next week when the United States casts what may be the sole vote against a code outlawing the promotion of infant formula.   Reagan Administration officials confirmed today that the White House had directly ordered the ''no'' vote, overriding the Departments of State and Health and Human Services. The two departments had recommended an abstention, officials said, to narrow the gap between the United States and the 156 other nations at the United Nations' World Health Assembly.   The leading American makers of powdered milk, Abbott Laboratories, the American Home Products Corporation and the Bristol-Myers Company, have waged a campaign for the ''no'' vote. Administration aides agreed with the manufacturers that there was no persuasive evidence of a connection between the promotion of powdered milk and a drop in breast-feeding and that the code infringes on free speech and restrains trade. In addition, Administration officials oppose any precedent for economic regulation by United Nations agencies."

The Fed's buying did not dispel the widespread uncertainty about future changes in interest rates. Traders are troubled by fluctuations in overnight interest rates, and many investors are not buying many long-term bonds until they are more confident that inflation and interest rates will subside.   ''With no such thing as a trading range for Federal funds anymore, the market is on edge,'' one Government securities dealer explained.  This lack of indication about how high or how low the rate may go increases greatly the risks of doing business because financing costs can change so rapidly, he observed. The result: less liquidity in the long-term market and wider price swings resulting from relatively few trades."

Mostly from North African and Arab countries, they are represented with disproportionate strength among the less-educated, the blue-collar work force and the politically hawkish.

''The guerrillas moved around very openly in daytime,'' he said.  ''Some had little plastic badges identifying their particular group.'' Most of them, he went on, had Soviet AK-47 assault rifles and ''no shortage of ammunition.''"

In the wake of the attempted rightist takeover, which was aimed at overturning the country's five-year-old democracy, representatives from multinational companies have trooped to Spain to take its weak economic and political pulse. The influx of capital is below the 1979 peak, but the decline does not seem to have been aggravated by the coup attempt.   Multinational companies that expect to use Spain as a springboard into the European Common Market appear to regard the country still as a good bet: Without democracy, Spain would be rejected by the European Economic Community. But some potential foreign investors also seem to have come to the distinct conclusion that a lurch back to more authoritarian rule would not be altogether bad for business."

The Russians seem desperate to arrange a forum for the discussion of disarmament.   Why? Because the Soviet Union, at the moment, needs to launch a new ''peace offensive.'' After its aggression in Afghanistan and its temptation to use force in Poland, the Soviet Union is once again seen by many Europeans to be a genuine threat. To lull the West back into a false sense of security - and in particular, to prevent the Europeans from letting the U.S. deploy theater nuclear weapons to counter the SS-20 missile threatening Europe - the Russians need a propaganda forum."

A gradual increase in the number of Iranian air attacks is expected to be followed by an offensive against strong Iraqi positions in the oil province of Khuzistan. One interpretation of Iranian preparations is that the Teheran Government has lost hope in mediation efforts by the Islamic League and the United Nations.   Recent reports from Teheran, confirmed by reconnaissance photographs, disclosed a significant buildup of military supplies in depots in and around the capital. They included large quantities of plasma and other medical supplies, a sign, analysts said, that Iran is preparing for heavy fighting later in the spring."

The issuance of such an order, which would come just days before the swearing-in of the next agency chairman, John S.R.

Mr. Shad, the sources said, has nonetheless given his approval for the commission's expected action.   The S.E.C. will be taking the action, sources said, because it concluded that a computerized trading link is needed to implement the 1975 law requiring the agency to ''facilitate'' development of a national market system for stock trading. Such a market, Congress had said, should employ advanced technology to link trading markets to insure that investors receive the best price on stock trades regardless of location."

Even then it was considered a strange law because it covered domestic farm products, while exempting so-called '' foreign commodities'' such as sugar, copper and other metals.   Actually, the law was a sop to farm groups who blamed the futures markets for the low prices they received during the Depression years. As far as the trade was then concerned, they were more upset by the principle, than by the law's effect. Few speculators at the time ever dreamed of holding three million bushels of corn, wheat or soybeans, or 30,000 bales of cotton, which are still the position limits on these items, for example."

The slogan is ''Constellation of States.'' Supposedly it has something to do with the just economic and political order that Prime Minister P.W. Botha says he wishes to create in southern Africa. But the precise nature of that order, the questions of who will belong to it and on what terms, of how it can be expected to satisfy the aspirations of the various population groups in this white-dominated country, all remain a blur.   Sometimes ''constellation'' is used to describe the proposed political and military grouping that would be created to withstand the ''Marxist threat'' that southern Africa is supposed to be facing - not just South Africa and the tiny black states it has created within its borders, which were formerly known as homelands, but neighboring nations as well."

And some may be particularly intriguing if interest rates turn down, since they allow the investor to lock in an interest rate for a period of time, but still provide the freedom to pull funds out."

Mr. Jaroszewicz, who was dropped as Prime Minister at a party congress in February 1980 and was expelled from the party several months ago, is widely reported to have enriched himself during his 10 years in office. In addition, his son was given a lucrative job heading an automobile importing agency while Mr. Jaroszewicz was Prime Minister."

For purposes of the most direct comparisons, the evaluation might best be made between the two major bank cards, Visa and MasterCard, on the one hand, and the three major travel-and-entertainment cards, American Express, Diner's Club and Carte Blanche, on the other. The biggest differences and advantages are the following:   - The bank cards offer revolving credit and a smaller credit line, usually from $500 to $2,000, with the limit rarely exceeded."

Getting a tan is one of many photochemical processes - that is, light-induced chemical changes - that are a part of everyday life.  Others include photography, in which pictures are produced by lightinduced changes in the chemicals on the film, and photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into the sugars they need to survive.   Despite the pervasiveness of a few applications, the controlled use of light to cause chemical reactions is in its infancy, according to most experts. Theoretically the stage was set for dramatic growth in photochemistry when the laser was invented 20 years ago.  Practically speaking, however, so much has remained unknown about the nature of light, the capabilities of lasers and the economics of photochemistry that commercial applications of laser-based chemistry have proved elusive."

Traders claim that extreme volatility of prices and interest rates will continue to make investors nervous and hide the underlying trends.

As predicted, item-by-item scrutiny of proposed cuts has brought forth the programs' supporters. The possibility that the President will not get the full $36 billion reduction in nondefense spending called for under the current budget resolution has made compromise on taxes increasingly important, some analysts say.   Lawrence Chimerine of Chase Econometrics now expects about $47 billion in tax cuts to survive, about $7 billion less than the current Reagan proposal. While a multi-year reduction in personal taxes seems likely, Mr. Chimerine says a two-year, 8 percent reduction in rates stands the best chance of passing Congress. And investment-oriented proposals to expand exemptions for individual retirement accounts and lower the maximum tax rate on unearned income and capital gains taxes are likely winners, he says, as is a lower ''marriage penalty.'' The more moderate cuts are to offset spending that may run $25 billion higher than Administration estimates for the coming fiscal year."

Last March, the company agreed to these terms, pending final commission approval.

The Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin is described by officials as eager to avoid a war with Syria, which would at the least undermine the peace treaty with Egypt and could spread into a wider conflict. Yet Mr. Begin has also convinced those who have seen him recently that he is serious about taking some form of military action if the missiles are not removed.   The Israeli concern stems from the increase in the Syrian presence in Lebanon that the missiles represent - beyond what the Israelis say was an understanding reached in 1976 - and from the threat the missiles could pose to Israeli planes conducting air strikes and reconnaissance missions against Palestinian guerrilla bases from which terrorist raids into Israel are launched."

Previously, officials had said only that Israel may have violated the agreement and that the matter was being reviewed.   However, Mr. Reagan went on to endorse at least some of Israel's justifications for the raid, saying: ''I do think that one has to recognize that Israel had reason for concern in view of the past history of Iraq, which has never signed a cease-fire or recognized Israel as a nation, has never joined in any peace effort for that.

Now it is introducing a system that might help save the LP from becoming obsolete.   The traditional grooved record is facing a challenge from the newer digital disks, which represent sound by a series of numbers rather than by oscillations of a stylus in a groove. These new disks and their players are expected to reach the market in two years and are generally expected to replace the LP in the long run because they offer higher-quality, fuller sound with no surface noise."

In the 12th century Moslem invaders brought Islam to Bengal, which is now part of Bangladesh, and the Moslem rulers remained until the British arrived in the 18th century. In 1947, predominantly Hindu India won independence from Britain and a separate Moslem state, Pakistan, was created in two parts divided by 1,000 miles of Indian territory. With power centered in West Pakistan, the more populous East Pakistan demanded greater economic benefits and political change. Rioting broke out in the East in 1968. In 1970 the separatists in the East won a majority in the National Assembly and called for more independence, but Assembly sessions were postponed by Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan, who was then President.  Rioting in the East erupted into civil war and Bangladesh was declared independent, forcing the resignation of Mr. Yahya Khan.  Sheik Mujibur Rahman, a leader of the Bengali nationalists in the East, became Prime Minister but was killed in a 1975 coup. His successor was also deposed, and Maj. Gen.

Arbatov, the Soviet Union's top expert on the United States, accused the Reagan Administration today of failing to formulate a coherent foreign policy in its first 100 days, and of generating anti-Soviet talk that was ''fraught with danger.''   In the long run, Mr. Arbatov wrote in the Communist Party daily Pravda, Mr. Reagan is bound to realize that ''there are no acceptable alternatives to peaceful coexistence.''   ''But the important question is how long this zigzag will last and what price will have to be paid for it,'' he said.  The article by the head of the Soviet Institute on the U.S.A. and Canada underscored Moscow's frustration with what Mr. Arbatov called the Reagan Administration's campaign of ''absurd inventions, accusations and threats.'' But it also suggested that Soviet policy makers have not written off Mr. Reagan as a potential partner in critical matters like arms negotiations."

George P. Shultz, the chairman of his 13-member economic policy coordination committee, has indicated that Mr. Reagan will stick to the strategy laid out in his major economic-policy statement of Sept. 9.   That plan, labeled ''Ronald Reagan's Strategy for Economic Growth and Stability,'' is therefore very much alive and worth careful reexamination. It represents an effort to marry the growth-oriented tax-cutting strategy of Mr. Reagan's populists - embodied most importantly in the Kemp-Roth bill for cutting personal income taxes by 30 percent in the next three years and thereafter indexing them to the rate of inflation - with the more cautious fiscal strategy of such conservatives as Mr. Shultz, Alan Greenspan and Arthur F. Burns."

The struggle over black housing, which has as much to do with racial ideology as with financing, is a measure of how hard it has been for that system to absorb the meaning of the violence of 1976.   On one side are die-hard apartheid supporters in key civil service positions who see Government control of housing as a weapon to limit the number of blacks. Increasingly this faction has sought to shape South Africa's racial laws so that the right of blacks to be in an urban area would depend on whether they were properly housed. And that, in the existing system, depends almost entirely on the authorities."

Delays in clearance amount to an invisible barrier against American exports."

The government expects to refund more money this year than a year ago, but bracket creep and stronger economic performance than was initially anticipated are expected to raise revenues even more. According to Treasury Department estimates, individual taxpayers will receive $47.7 billion in refunds this year, 6.4 percent higher than 1980 levels. Average refunds are expected to reach $635 this year, up from $590 in 1980. With promised tax cuts still an unrealized dream, most economists expect the money to raise consumer spending. However, few think the impact will be substantial. In spite of the refunds, the government is expected to take in nearly 13 percent more revenue from individuals in 1981 than last year, an estimated $325 billion, somewhat more than first anticipated. While some analysts think the increase could reduce Government borrowing requirements in the second quarter, others like Lacy H. Hunt of Philadelphia's Fidelity Bank see no slowdown in expenditure growth, and expect Washington's credit needs to remain strong."

They are not the ultimate contrary opinionists; they are aficionados of antique bills and rare notes. The objects of their affections beguile the eye with elaborate engravings and beautiful colors, odd shapes (hexagonal) and even odder denominations (6 1/4 cents), fascinating adjuncts to history that serve to remind just how multifarious and provisional the notion of money has been. Judging from price trends, collecting currency also represents a new twist on the adage that money makes money. An old $5 bill bought for $6.75 in 1948 recently sold for $1,800, a gain of roughly 267-fold. ''I would say that in the past five years, notes in general have appreciate 2,000 percent,'' says Herbert Melnick."

Mr. Ortega, who has been attending a meeting here of the World Council for Peace and who was the guest of President Fidel Castro at celebrations last night marking the 20th anniversary of the Cuban victory at the Bay of Pigs, was particularly critical of the training of Nicaraguan exiles at camps in Florida.   The Nicaraguan Government, he said at a news conference for Cuban and American journalists, had recently sent a note of protest to Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and had also discussed the matter with the American Ambassador in Managua."

With uncertainty about Arab reaction and possible retaliation, Administration and Congressional leaders were cautious about making assessments that went beyond the State Department's strong condemnation of the Israeli raid.   Officials feared, however, that the Israeli strike had not only complicated Philip C. Habib's peacemaking effort in Lebanon but might also handicap broader American efforts to promote Arab-Israeli peace and to encourage a strategic consensus by Israel and moderate Arabs to resist Soviet penetration of the region. Fostering Arab Solidarity   Normally, when tensions rise between Israel and an Arab nation, moderate Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan feel the pull of Arab solidarity and become more reluctant than usual to be drawn into the peace process with Israel. Iraq's call for an Arab meeting seemed to be designed to exploit such tensions."

But United States and NATO military analysts, as well as some Arab military sources, believe Iraq is unlikely to accept the humiliation of the attack without attempting some form of reprisal. The possibility that reprisal action might lead to a another Arab-Israeli war is a major concern. A related issue is whether the Israelis intend to establish a nuclear monopoly in the Middle East."

But the analysts say that several factors, including the Reagan Administration's willingness to sell more grain to the Soviet Union, would determine how long prices might continue to rise and to what level.   In the face of mounting complaints from farm leaders and from Republicans in Congress who represent farm states, Agriculture Secretary John R. Block has been saying he is ''increasingly optimistic'' about an end to the grain curb soon. But there was still no support for such optimism from the White House today.  Administration spokesmen insisted that no decision had been made and that none was likely to be made as long as unrest in Poland continues."

Aggravating the situation was a perplexing increase in overnight interest rates. Overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market averaged about 19 1/2 percent and rose to 21 percent for much of the afternoon, a sharp increase from the 16.28 percent average for the week ended Wednesday and the range of 15 to 15 1/2 percent that prevailed in the first half of April.   The rising interest rates had a severe impact on other markets, too. Investor confidence in the stock market suffered, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.57 points, to 997.75 -closing below 1,000 for the first time in 11 sessions. (Page D6.) Expectations that higher rates would attract funds to dollar-denominated accounts sent the dollar up sharply in foreign-exchange trading. It reached a 10-year high against the French franc, and set a record against the lira. (Page D11.)"

But farmers and grain traders cautioned that the actual harvest would undoubtedly not be that high. Today's report, they noted, was based on planting conditions as of June 1 and did not take into consideration recent flooding in Indiana and Ohio, which has prevented some planting in those key states. When the Agriculture Department issues its first production forecast on July 10, they predicted, the outlook will be down sharply. They expect a crop closer to 6.5 billion bushels, which would mean a tight supply for the second straight year."

Mr. Sadat, who will be meeting tomorrow with Secretary of State Alexander M.

The officials discussed this possibility as the White House, seeking to demonstrate that foreign policy business was going on as usual despite the wounding of President Reagan, announced formally that Chester A. Crocker, the Assistant Secretary of State-designate for African Affairs, would lead a mission to southern Africa next month.   The Administration wants to ask the various parties to consider adoption of a ''Zimbabwe formula,'' in which the future laws of the country would be worked out before an election took place. The current United Nations plan for South-West Africa's independence says elections would be held first to set up a constituent assembly that would in turn draft the laws."

Copper futures prices on New York's Commodity Exchange provided an example of the impact of interest rates, which are the dominant factor in all futures markets today.

The bankers are responding in part to a beginning-of-the-year tendency toward optimism and to the very high spreads being offered by Brazil. But the representatives of foreign banks here are also acting out of belief that the austerity measures being adopted by Brasilia are the correct ones to combat the soaring inflation and manage the foreign debt that is the largest in the developing world."

Although the rate was below November's 7.5 percent, the improvement was too slight to suggest any real recovery. Janet L.

''To make an oak fall,'' he said in an interview, ''one must start by sawing it.''

Buffett, always reflects on the world of business in his company's annual report.  This year his subject is the impact of inflation on corporate earnings, and he paints a grim picture. As always, his remarks have relevance for the nation's shareholders generally.   In Mr. Buffett's view, it is a mistake to focus on reported earnings in determining how the owners of a business did. Only gains in purchasing power represent real earnings on investment, he says, and he uses this illustration to prove his point:   ''If you (a) forgo 10 hamburgers to purchase an investment, (b) receive dividends which, after tax, buy two hamburgers and (c) receive, upon sale of your holdings, after-tax proceeds that will buy eight hamburgers, then (d) you have had no real income from your investment, no matter how much it appreciated in dollars. You may feel richer, but you won't eat richer.''"

Several developments over the last few days suggest that as things stand now, there is a slightly more than even chance that the series of right-of-center presidencies that have run the Fifth Republic since Charles de Gaulle set it up 23 years ago will give way to one to the left of center.   Of the two major polls taken since last Sunday's first-round balloting - in which the President finished slightly ahead of his Socialist challenger but did not win a majority - one has 51.5 percent favoring Mr. Mitterrand and 48.5 percent for Mr. Giscard d'Estaing.

Yet the Gaumont name is written in tiny letters on its billboards, and its executives meet in a secluded villa removed from the festival limelight.   This low profile typifies the company's distinctly untheatrical demeanor in an industry sometimes given to histrionics.  From an unremarkable modern building just outside the Paris city limits, a young management team has brought the company from a sleepy family entertainment business with revenues of $31.3 million in 1975 to one of Europe's hottest competitors, with revenues of $82.4 million last year."

In a medical bulletin issued at Gemelli Hospital and the Vatican, the Pope's doctors said that the tests, which were carried out over the last three days, confirmed an earlier finding that the wounds in his abdomen were not infected.   The cause of the infection, which was identified as a cytomegalovirus, is often transmitted through the blood, according to a medical expert. In the emergency operation after the Pope was shot he was given about 10 pints of blood, which means that virtually his entire blood volume was replaced. But today's bulletin made no connection between the virus and the blood transfusion."

The big German concern was to a certain extent forced into this heady world of international construction in the early 1970's, when a slumping market in West Germany led it to seek projects abroad.   And at the same time, the company found that engineers fresh from successes in Kuwait or Brazil brought new ideas to building subways or streets in Mainz or Hanover.   Today, however, Hochtief may be facing its biggest challenge: how to engineer continued profits in the face of a renewed building slump in Germany, a worldwide recession, growing political uncertainties and spreading competition from builders in developing countries. Competition Is Broad   ''There is competition from Korea and the Far East, Brazil and Mexico,'' said Harald Peiper, Hochtief's chief financial officer and head of international operations at the company's headquarters here.  ''On the best projects, they're always along. Building is one of the first things these countries want to do themselves. It's part of a profound shift on the market.''"

Fluor shares, which closed at 46, were the sixth most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. Some traders forecast further declines, while others expressed optimism about the multibilliondollar takeover proposal.   Only a day earlier, the two companies reached a preliminary merger agreement that calls for Fluor to pay $60 a share for 45 percent of St. Joe's stock and to swap 1.2 shares of Fluor stock for each of the remaining St. Joe shares."

Now, with the rising cost of energy, critics increasingly are suggesting that this agriculture pattern may be costing consumers dearly, both in dollars and in food security.   A new study, released last week, details what the American food system means for Pennsylvania, the most important agricultural state in the Northeastern region. Pennsylvania, according to the report, imported $8.4 billion worth of food - almost 70 percent of its total food needs - in 1980. That figure includes $400 million for transportation costs alone."

The former inspector, Roger Richter, was one of three people familiar with nuclear reactors to testify this morning that Iraq was capable of using the reactor bombed on June 7 to produce plutonium, which can be used to make atomic weapons.  But neither of the other witnesses, Robert Seldon, head of the applied theoretical physics division at Los Alamos Laboratory, nor Herbert J.C. Kouts, chairman of the department of nuclear energy at Brookhaven National Laboratory, would say under questioning if he believed that Iraq was in fact planning to use the reactor to produce fissionable material for weapons.   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr.  Richter said his concern over agency constraints in inspecting the Iraqi reactor led him to report his misgivings to the State Department last year. He said that he had never personally inspected the reactor, explaining that checks of the Iraqi plant had been conducted only by Soviet or Eastern European members of the International Atomic Energy Agency."

Thus began the Communist rite of spring in the Soviet capital, a demonstration as carefully orchestrated and controlled as the Chicago event it commemorates was chaotic and unforeseen.

Rural blacks who cannot find employment in this small frontier town in the western Transvaal have no real alternative to working in the mines, for there is no prospect of a job or productive farming in the crowded countryside where they live. But now, with job hunger growing in the rural black areas of southern Africa, work in the mines is hard to come by even though the industry is in a period of expansion.    In the first two weeks of May there were hundreds of job-seekers in the rural area of Bophuthatswana known as Lehurutshe. But there were only 38 new jobs to be filled at the office of the Employment Bureau of Africa, which serves as the recruiting arm for the six major South African mining houses."

The immediate cause is Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's new nationalistic energy policy, which uses discriminatory taxing and exploration grant guidelines to favor oil companies defined as Canadian-owned. The goal is to raise domestic ownership of Canada's petroleum industry to 50 percent by 1990 from 28 percent today.   Government planners hope that many huge foreign energy companies, such as Exxon, Gulf, Texaco, Acquitaine, Chevron and British Petroleum, will sell all or part of their Canadian subsidiaries to Canadian companies, including Petro-Canada, the state oil company.  The federal Government is using Petro-Canada to gain its own substantial share of the oil business."

Both business and pleasure travel rise in good economic times, while they are fall off during recessions.   Yet in the last 12 months, airline stocks have shown in interesting ways how stock prices in a cyclical industry sometimes surge en masse, sometimes come in for individual scrutiny by investors, and sometimes are affected by special external considerations, such as the recent drop in fuel prices.   Over the last year, the basic movement among the airline stocks has been strongly upward, despite the widespread operating losses during 1980. As a group, the stocks of the 13 airlines, which include the 10 major airlines, known as ''trunk carriers,'' and three regional airlines - Frontier, Texas Air and USAir - soared by 113 percent between late April 1980 and the close of trading last Wednesday.

This is in sharp contrast to the problems that oil brought to Western economies after the Iranian revolution two and a half years ago.   Bulging worldwide oil inventories are 400 million barrels greater than normal, spot prices have slipped by more than $2 a barrel and expectations are rising that oil prices will decline or remain stable for the rest of the year.   Government statistics show that the abundance of oil is already slowing inflation, aiding economic growth and cutting the United States trade deficit to the slimmest total in more than five years.   These economic gains are also strengthening the dollar, which is approaching its record high levels of the early 1970's on the world's foreign exchange markets. (Page 29.)"

Big banks must obtain the Fed's permission for practically any new venture or product - even to open or close a small branch. In addition, the Fed rules with a certain moral authority that it gets from just being the Fed - it commands awe and deference.   Most bankers, therefore, have been understandably reluctant to take on the Federal Reserve. Today, however, the Fed has a rebellion on its hands. The banks are being punished by competition from money market mutual funds, and on Wall Street, such formidable names as American Express and Prudential have formed alliances with leading brokerage firms, further threatening the banks' competitive position."

His desire to return to gold ran afoul of the convictions of the monetarists, who strongly favor floating exchange rates rather than the fixed exchange rates required by the gold standard. The answer to inflation, the monetarists say, is a slow and steady rate of increase in the money supply. The gold standard's history, they note, was one of turbulence, crises and ultimately great depressions when wartime inflation clashed with a fixed relationship of gold and currencies."

Haig Jr.'s 27,643-mile Asian mission is drawing to a close today with the satisfaction that he had felt over the trip somewhat dampened.   Mr. Haig's mood has been hurt by the political uproar over the criticism of Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States delegate to the United Nation, that came from his party and by the growing complaints that the Reagan Administration lacks a coherent foreign policy.   The Secretary arrived in Hawaii two days ago after a grueling overnight flight from New Zealand hoping to spend some time on the beach before meeting with President Reagan in Los Angeles to report on his travels. But suddenly the focus has shifted from the pros and cons of the Administration's China policy to whether Mrs. Kirkpatrick and Mr. Haig were at odds over how she handled herself during the negotiations last week on the resolution condemning Israel.   The information on Mr. Haig's role in the Security Council debate was first provided as a result of questions from reporters on what the Secretary was doing about other parts of the world while he was in Asia. But his staff also wanted to give him public credit for what many of them regarded as extraordinary hours spent on behalf of the country."

The battalion, made up of black refugees from Angola and a few Europeans who would normally be described as mercenaries, is a unit of the South African Army, but the only South African citizens in it appear to be its commander and senior noncommissioned officers.   Four South African journalists who visited the unit at its base in the western part of the Caprivi Strip, adjoining Angola, were told that most of the troops were former soldiers in the Front for the Liberation of Angola, a faction that was defeated in the struggle for power after Portugal granted independence to Angola in 1975.  Other blacks in the battalion used to serve in the Portuguese Army."

This stability requires that all nations act with restraint and responsibility. Claims by the Soviet Union that it too subscribes to such policies are not borne out by Soviet deeds."

Many analysts believe that much of the money that is going into money funds is coming from banks and savings institutions, which pay lower interest rates.

Mr. Ito was understood to have resigned to take responsibility for confusion here over the wording of a United States-Japanese communique issued after Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki met with President Reagan in Washington last week. Mr. Ito accompanied the Prime Minister to the United States.   The controversy arose from the use of the word ''alliance'' in the communique. The word was used in the context of United States-Japanese relations to imply, Foreign Ministry officials said later, that a military relationship was developing between the two countries, as hoped for by the Reagan Administration."

According to Israeli diplomats, Israel fears that President Reagan may have been maneuvered into a position where, against his own instincts, he will have to ask Israel for concessions it will not make. These include opening up its own nuclear reactor for international inspection, dropping its opposition to the sale of radar planes to Saudi Arabia, or moderating its position on removing Syrian missiles from Lebanon.   The Israelis say that the maneuvering is being done by Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger and that it could result in further Israeli-American tension. Mr. Reagan stopped shipment of four F-16 fighter-bombers to Israel after it used F-16's in the June 7 raid on an Iraqi nuclear reactor."

The increase in this interest rate, called the discount rate, came late in a day of turbulence in the financial markets.  On the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 16.48 points to 979.11. Brokers said that stock prices fell sharply from the opening because traders had expected interest rates to rise because of Friday's announcement of a sharp increase in the money supply.   By early afternoon, major banks had raised their prime rate a full percentage point, to 19 percent. The prime, an indication of the direction of most interest rates, is described by banks as the rate charged on short-term loans to their best corporate customers, although these loans are often made at a lower rate.

Slowly, however, computers are learning to speak people's language.   In laboratories around the nation, scientists are grappling with making computers understand English so that people can communicate ''naturally'' with them.   Development of such natural language systems is part of an effort to make computers easier to use. At the National Computer Conference in Chicago last week, the feature attraction was the Star work station, a computer terminal developed by the Xerox Corporation, which allows its user to point at little pictures on the screen rather than to type commands. Other vendors demonstrated terminals that could recognize voice commands. These developments are expected to help computers become more widely used by businessmen and eventually by consumers who have had no formal computer training."

Haig Jr. to the Trilateral Commission in Washington on March 31:   The controversy over American foreign policy and human rights concerns four questions: Firstly, is our concern for human rights in other countries compatible with the pursuit of America's national interest?  Secondly, how does our foreign policy reflect our concern for human rights?  Thirdly, how should we treat violators of human rights?  And the fourth question, how can we advance human rights in the world today?  Unless we can answer these questions, we cannot speak of a human rights policy. And the way we answer these questions tells us a great deal about how we view ourselves as a people and the problems we face today in international affairs.   Let me deal first with the question of whether a concern for human rights is compatible with the pursuit of America's national interest. My answer to this is a resounding yes."

The British development comes at a time when the navies of the non-Communist world are preparing to place orders for a new generation of torpedoes, which defense experts estimate could bring manufacturers as much as $16 billion worth of new business over the next 20 years.   The challenger is the Marconi Company, which after nearly 12 years and $400 million of research, has developed a new generation of torpedoes that ''think'' as they swim, a feat that Marconi executives say is five to 10 years ahead of American technology.   In general, United States makers dispute that claim by Marconi.  Spokesmen for both the Gould Corporation of Cleveland and the Honeywell Corporation of Minneapolis said, however, that they could not provide details about the performance capabilities of their torpedoes because of constraints imposed by their contracts with the Defense Department."

This was a sharp defeat for the ''free traders'' in the Administration, led by Secretary of the Treasury Donald T. Regan, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who thought they had already won the internal battle.   On April 15, Mr. Weidenbaum, when asked in an interview with The New York Times whether the Administration had decided against trying to impose quotas on the Japanese, replied: ''Oh, no question. We've taken a strong, adamant position against quotas. In fact, I must admit I got quite a charge out of a senior representative of the previous Administration who made his mark on public policy by negotiating formal orderly marketing agreements urging us in strong terms not to succumb to protectionist sentiment.''"

In 1971 the company's stock traded as high as 45 7/8, a figure that still stands as its highest price of the last 10 years.  American Can's announcement served to exemplify a development that, in one form or another, is sweeping through corporate board rooms.  Kenneth S.

A young man from an impoverished family in eastern Turkey, Mr. Agca went west to Istanbul to seek his fortune and fell in with a group of right-wing extremists who had chosen terror as a way of life.   The roots of political violence in Turkey are generally traced to the 1968 student uprisings in Western Europe, which were followed by a wave of leftist talk and student demonstrations in Turkey.   There was no serious violence then, but the radical right took fright and began to organize anti-Communist raiding groups. There were inevitable clashes, a few people were killed and the radical left-right vendetta had set in."

Meanwhile, records levels were reached yesterday for both the American Stock Exchange's market-value index, which rose 1.94, to 375.47, and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, which added 1.01, to 220.24."

Trade officials here said that this message would be communicated to Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki of Japan when he arrives in West Germany tomorrow for two days of talks with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt at the start of a 13-day tour of Europe.   On Saturday, Bonn's Economics Minister, Count Otto Lambsdorff, left for Tokyo for four days of talks with Japanese Government officials and industry leaders. He is seeking a relaxation of Japanese import restrictions and assurances that Japan's recent agreement to restrain car exports to the United States would not increase car sales to Europe."

The personnel changes were more of a shuffle than a shakeup. Jozef Pinkowski, who served as Prime Minister during much of the crisis and was replaced in mid-February, was dropped from the Politburo. His dismissal was something of a foregone conclusion, since he was widely viewed as ineffective and associated with the party's old guard, now in disrepute."

In addition, he said, Syria must make a commitment not to fire missiles from its own territory at Israeli reconnaissance planes operating over Lebanon.   These demands, made in a television interview with the NBC News program ''Today,'' were expected to complicate diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict over the missiles.

The Foreign Ministers of the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia declared that a political settlement must be based on three initial steps: the introduction of a United Nations peacekeeping force, the withdrawal of the Vietnamese Army and the disarming of the warring Cambodian factions once the Vietnamese have left.   A senior diplomat from one of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said that the five countries' strategy was to convince Vietnam that it was in its interest to reach a political settlement that would make Cambodia neutral and thus satisfy Hanoi's security concerns.   ''This is not directed against the interests of Vietnam but the beginning of a common effort to enhance the longer-term interests of the region,'' said Carlos P. Romulo, Foreign Minister of the Philippines. ''Asean urges Vietnam to see the light of reason,'' he said, referring to the regional organization by its initials."

Although the law considers all noncash benefits to be taxable income unless they are specifically exempted by the tax code, historically such perquisites as bargain air fares for airline employees and free tuition for children of university professors have not been taxed.   These benefits can be worth thousands of dollars to people who work for the ''right'' employers. Take the hypothetical case of a family of four in which the father is an airline executive, the mother is a college professor and the daughter works as a clerk at a retail store. The entire family travels to Europe every summer, lives in a comfortable house provided by the wife's employer and has free use of the school's recreational facilities. The father's company pays for his chauffeur-driven limousine that takes him to and from the office, and also pays for his city luncheon club. Their teen-age son gets a free education at a neighboring college, and the family buys most of its clothes and furniture at a large discount from the store where the daughter works. Such a family's untaxed fringe benefits would easily surpass $20,000 a year."
