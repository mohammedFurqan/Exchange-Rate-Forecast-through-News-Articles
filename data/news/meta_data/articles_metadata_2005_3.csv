The airlines of China have ordered 165 planes this year valued at $17 billion from Airbus and Boeing Company, making them the world's largest buyers of aircraft. Two of three of the planes bought this year in China were Boeing models. Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, is counting on the world's fastest-growing aviation market to maintain its sales and delivery lead over Chicago-based Boeing. Chinese airlines may need 1,790 new planes, valued at $230 billion, in the next 18 years, starting with the transportation demands of an estimated 70 million visitors during the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 Shanghai World Expo, according to Airbus estimates. (Bloomberg News)    Airline in Taiwan to Buy Mainland Cargo Carrier       China Airlines, Taiwan's largest airline, said yesterday that it would join with two shipping companies to buy a combined 37 percent stake in the mainland Chinese air cargo carrier Yangtze River Express Airlines. The deal marks China Airlines' latest effort to tap into the mainland's rapidly growing cargo market, after it failed to close a deal to buy a 25 percent stake in another Chinese cargo airline after four years of negotiations. The plan still needs the approval of the governments of Taiwan and China. A venture with a Chinese carrier is the only way China Airlines can enter the China market, as China and Taiwan have never agreed on the establishment of regular direct transport links. Despite political tensions, Taiwan and China have close commercial relations. Taiwanese companies have invested more than $100 billion in the mainland since the early 1990's and trade between the sides now exceeds $60 billion annually. The Taiwanese airline said yesterday that it planned to pay $39 million for a 25 percent stake in Yangtze River Express, a wholly owned unit of China's Hainan Airlines Group. In separate filings with the Taiwan Stock Exchange, Yang Ming Marine Transport and Wan Hai Lines said they would each pay $9.4 million for 6 percent of Yangtze River. (AP)    DaimlerChrysler Spokesman Denies Insider Trading       DaimlerChrysler's chief spokesman denied yesterday that he used inside knowledge to trade in the company's shares, in response to media reports that his offices were searched by prosecutors. ''There is nothing to these allegations,'' another company spokesman quoted Hartmut Schick as saying, adding that Mr. Schick had not bought any DaimlerChrysler shares for 15 years. Mr. Schick himself was not available for comment. An executive board member, Rüdiger Grube, left, the head of business development and of operations in China, also denied in a weekend newspaper interview that he was involved in insider deals. On Thursday, German prosecutors investigating possible insider trading of Daimler stock searched the homes and offices of four people, including two DaimlerChrysler staff members. German media said the search included the offices of Mr. Grube and Mr. Schick. German state prosecutors and the country's financial watchdog BaFin are investigating trading of Daimler shares before the surprise announcement on July 28 of Jürgen Schrempp's resignation as of the end of the year. BaFin has said it had concrete indications of improper deals in the firm's stock before the news, which sent the share price up more than 10 percent. (Reuters)    Gas Supplier in Spain Bids for Big Power Company       Gas Natural SDG, Spain's largest natural gas supplier, has offered 22.6 billion euros ($28.3 billion) for Endesa, the country's biggest power company, its second hostile attempt in two years to create Spain's dominant energy company. Gas Natural will offer 7.34 euros in cash and 0.569 of a share for each Endesa share, Gas Natural said in a statement yesterday to stock market regulators. The offer is 12 percent more than the 19.09 euros at which Endesa shares were suspended early yesterday. Antoni Brufau, Gas Natural's vice chairman, for more than two years has sought to build a power and gas company capable of competing with E.ON of Germany and Électricité de France, utilities that are more than twice the size of any provider in Spain. He led the company's unsolicited bid for Iberdrola in 2003, a plan that was blocked by regulators. ''There is merit in the idea of a combination as Endesa wants to boost its gas operations and Gas Natural wants to be more active in power,'' said Rele Adesina, an analyst with West LB in London, in a note to investors. ''Still, a merger would be more dignified for Endesa, and we would not expect it to succumb to such aggression without a bitter fight.'' (Bloomberg News)    Carlyle Group Buys Child Car Seat Unit of Britax       The Carlyle Group, a Washington-based buyout firm, agreed to buy a unit of Britax International that makes car seats for children for £230 million ($425 million). Britax Childcare, which also makes Roemer and Safe-n-Sound child car seats, had sales of £120 million pounds in 2004, Carlyle said in a statement Monday. Britax, owned by the buyout unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, is selling the unit to cut debt. ''Britax has an excellent position in a strong market,'' Glenn Youngkin, a managing director at Carlyle, said in the statement. Britax's products include the Cosy Tot Isofix seat for children. Carlyle is paying for the business through the $2.2 billion European buyout fund it raised in March. The firm wants to increase its investments in consumer-goods makers and retailers after hiring Sandra Horbach to head its consumer and retail group four months ago. (Bloomberg News)  "

Hughes, pressing her campaign to promote democracy and improve the American image in the Middle East, won a commitment from the Egyptian prime minister, Ahmed Nazif, to ease emergency restrictions on political freedoms in the next session of the Parliament, her chief aide said. The aide, Dina Powell, said Mr. Nazif had told them that President Hosni Mubarak could not lift the restrictions on the rights of assembly and protest without replacing them with an anti-terrorism law he would seek to get passed. The emergency laws were imposed in 1981 after the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat and have been used since to arrest suspected extremists. The United States has repeatedly called for them to be lifted. Ms. Hughes, the administration's top envoy for public diplomacy, also met with ''opinion leaders'' friendly to the United States but critical of some American policies and then flew to Saudi Arabia for meetings with officials and women's groups today.

(Bloomberg News)    Creator of Sasser Internet Worm Ordered to Do Community Service  Polo Ralph Lauren Climbs on Strong Results Shares of the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation rose $3.87, or 8.9 percent yesterday, to $47.34, after the New York-based clothing maker said operating margins were better than expected in its fiscal first quarter, which ended July 2. More full-price selling has been increasing revenue in both the retail and wholesale operations, while cost-cutting has further helped improve operating margins, Roger N. Farah, its president and chief operating officer, said. The company will report first-quarter results on Aug. 9. Sales for the first quarter are expected to rise about 20 percent, in line with the company's previous forecast, the company said.

How does a firewall program know if someone or some program is trying to deliberately break into a computer?    A. Firewalls -- named after the flame-blocking structures designed to keep fires from spreading -- are programmed to analyze the network traffic flowing between your computer and the Internet. The firewall compares the information it monitors with a set of rules in its database. If it sees something not allowed, say, another computer trying to connect to one of the machines on your network, the firewall can block and prevent the action.  "

The chairman of Deutsch, New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, he appears five nights a week on ''The Big Idea With Donny Deutsch,'' on CNBC. Mr. Deutsch is also the author of ''Often Wrong, Never in Doubt: Unleash the Business Rebel Within'' (Collins, $24.95), to be released in October. Here are excerpts from a conversation.    Q. Corporate scandals have tarnished the popular image of the chief executive. Is it recovering?    A. Yes, everything is cyclical. Clearly, around 2000, it was time for some chief executives to do the perp walk, whether Bernie Ebbers or Dennis Kozlowski. It's not much different from the end of the 1980's with the Ivan Boeskys of the world and Michael Milken. It was also the end of an era and there was a lot of greed.    Q. You say that business, pop culture, news and entertainment are blurring these days. How so?    A. You can watch news and information television. But news is packaged differently on other shows. You watch some of the more tabloid, ''Access Hollywood'' kinds of shows, where you see promotion of products versus entertainment. The promotion becomes the entertainment.     Likewise, politicians go on late-night entertainment shows. Business leaders can turn up there, too. I was on the Carson Daly show. Jim Cramer was on ''Conan O'Brien.''    Q. You have a television show. But do the vast majority of chief executives have time to go out and become celebrities?    A. Clearly not. Their job is to build their companies, and that's what I've spent the last 20 years doing. I've stepped back and I'm now chairman and I will be naming a C.E.O. I would not be doing this if I were a hands-on, driving C.E.O. Those two worlds would not make sense in most cases.     But for Donald Trump, that's part of his brand. Martha Stewart, she is her brand also. I always had an individual brand. This is something I'm just venturing out to do. Clients get a kick out of it.    Q. What's your take on Donald Trump?    A. He's one of the brilliant marketers of our time. He has consistency and remains true to his values. The Trump brand is one of the most clearly defined brands. If you line up 100 people and ask them what it means, they'll tell you upscale and glitzy. They may not like it, but it's clear what it is. Not all brands are for everybody. All great brands have clarity to them. They don't have to be for everybody. If you make a car for everybody, you don't have a clearly defined car.    Q. And what's your view of Martha Stewart?    A. The sexiest story in the world is someone who is on the way down but then in the next story is on the way back up. She understands that going to prison has worked for her by making her more human. She's been brilliant in incorporating that.    Q. Can celebrities simply be manufactured?    A. We now have celebrities who are nothing but celebrities, like Paris Hilton. They didn't get celebrity from somewhere else. We do live in a crazy world. For the most part, the public chooses whom they are interested in and with whom they want to engage. Some of it can be manufactured, sure. We all know what publicists do. But for the most part, not. Paris Hilton has a very clearly defined brand. She is the poster child for today's young and for sexuality and decadence. Dumb is the new black. The truth is, she's dumb like a fox.    Q. Do most chief executives want to be in the limelight?    A. Most C.E.O.'s in our world of Sarbanes-Oxley don't want to be front and center. But they should be the embodiment of the core values of the company. Charisma can be a very powerful tool.    Q. What advice do you have for business executives about exercising charisma?    A. The fact that I did have a persona in our business did help us build the agency. Sometimes it works for you. Sometimes it works against you. You have to accept that.      A guy like Richard Branson has made his personality work. Or you can take Warren Buffett, who is a nonpersonality, but that in effect has become a personality.    Q. You built an independent agency, then ran it as part of Interpublic. Now you say you're pulling back as chief executive. Were you a good chief?    A. The record speaks for itself. The agency was very small. My dad built the beginning of it. We went on to become one of the dominant agencies.      My real talent as C.E.O. was putting the most brilliant people around me. I subscribed to the Ronald Reagan school of management. That's the job of any C.E.O. at the end of the day.    Q. Is advertising going away?    A. Consumer touch points keep getting fragmented. And consumers have more control over what they see. Messages have to become more and more customized. But there's a troika between the product, the consumer and the advertiser. There's going to be some commercial formula between the three of them. Someone's going to be paying for it.      The 30-second commercial isn't going away. It just may be that you and I living next door and watching the same television show may see different commercials. We may control when we watch those commercials. But they're not going away."

Green, the chief executive of Accenture, the global consulting firm, says that more than 25 percent of today's working-age population will leave the American workplace by 2010. That will leave a shortage of 10 million workers and a huge gap in skills and knowledge, Mr. Green argues. Here are excerpts from a conversation:    Q. How big an issue is the aging of the work force?    A. A lot of the intellectual capability and the heartbeat of companies is about to retire. The rate of that picks up every year. If you look at some companies, it's not uncommon to see 25 or 50 percent of the operating leadership -- I don't mean the chief level, I mean the people who run the place, who are the heartbeat of the place -- who are all in their late 50's and early 60's. They will choose to retire in two or three years.    Q. Why aren't companies ready for this?    A. A lot of it has to do with demographics. A lot of it has to do with mobility in the younger generation. In other words, people move from company to company and from job to job. To have someone with 15 or 20 years' experience at the same company and ready to step into that next role is a lot less common than it was for the generation before them.    Q. How can companies prepare?    A. Seventy-five percent of the solution is the ability to translate what's in people's minds into new processes which are enabled by things like decision-support technologies, information management and automated business analytics.           But a vast percentage of the decisions that get made day to day are based on someone rubbing their fingers together and saying on the basis of instinct, ''I think we ought to turn left instead of right.'' There's no amount of computer code or process definition that can capture that synthesis of six or eight key considerations to make a decision. In the end, a lot is based on instinct. ''I've been there, done that.''    Q. Is there enough time to respond?    A. It's less about tomorrow. It's about five years from now. In true American fashion, if we have the will and the resolve to fix things, we do. That's why people are working hard on this work force transformation and are working hard on capturing processes and technologies that help us have predictable outcomes.    Q. So technology is the key?    A. Technology has done a great job at providing data. People install these large enterprise resource planning systems that generate a lot of pretty charts. The reports come out. But we have data overload and information underload. What information management, business analytics and business intelligence are all about is, how do you take all that and put in it in a format that helps people make decisions? We think this is going to be a $27-billion-a-year market in four or five years. We just invested $100 million in our information management capability.    Q. Isn't it a little utopian to think that information systems can replace complex human decision-making?    A. That's why I said that 75 percent of the problem can be dealt with by capturing and synthesizing the data, but there's 25 percent of it that you will never replace because the human mind holds all the cards when it comes to the synthesis of a lot of moving things. That stuff will never be replaced.    Q. Aside from developing new systems, what else are managements doing to prepare for this shift?    A. We need what I call the next generation of succession planning. We have tended to do succession planning at the very top: we have three candidates to be the next chief executive officer and we let them shoot it out. But the equally important consideration is the supply chain and logistics manager, the person who runs the machine shop, the distribution manager, the merchandiser -- all those key operating positions where million-dollar decisions are made in seconds every day. For those, you need to start thinking really hard about how you will bring along the next generation.    Q. Won't some baby boomers choose to avoid the full, traditional kind of retirement and stay engaged in some way in the workplace as consultants or advisers?    A. It's a Band-Aid. Yes, you'll be able to reach out and get capability. Yes, people will help you transition from one thing to another. But if you wait until that day, it'll be too late. I believe we have an obligation to bring along the next generation so that they're prepared for the jobs before they have to step into them.    Q. How will this play out for manufacturing?    A. The work force, the people who chase parts in factories, who make the engine move -- this is just a huge issue. One of the technologies that's getting a lot of play to help this transition is e-learning. What it's about is, how do you make people capable of doing the job at a dramatically faster rate than simply allowing them to gain experience on the job? The key seems to be business simulations.    Q. What is business simulation?    A. The best example is if you take how we train pilots in aircraft simulators. You would never want to train a pilot in a real airplane. We use that same concept for business functions and jobs. You create an environment that teaches people how to make decisions. It's all interactive and it's all online. You can do it at any time."

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting a 43 cent-per-share profit when Alcoa announces financial results on Oct. 10. Alcoa blamed lower aluminum prices and higher costs, particularly in energy and raw materials. Seasonal weakness in Europe and automotive markets also hurt business. Alcoa also said Hurricane Rita's impact would hurt third-quarter results. The company, based in Pittsburgh, was forced to close its Point Comfort, Tex., alumina refinery and the Lake Charles, La., anode plant because of the hurricane.

But it did say it would focus the cuts on high-cost plants and increase sourcing from Asia as it seeks other ways to increase productivity while introducing new products.

They agreed to appoint Mateo Diego-Fernandez to oversee the process, which involves collecting data on markets and similar companies from other World Trade Organization members. The information will be used to assess the Airbus and Boeing subsidies. The W.T.O. set up legal panels two months ago to investigate cases brought by the two trade powers, which accuse each other of illegally subsidizing the aircraft makers. (AP)    ACE Aviation Holdings , the owner of Air Canada, said it reached an agreement with its pilots union that might allow the carrier to renegotiate an aircraft order with the Boeing Company. The Air Canada Pilots Association, which represents 3,100 pilots, agreed to a binding arbitration process that gives the airline ''certainty on pilot costs,'' Air Canada said. In June, the pilots rejected a contract with Air Canada to fly new Boeing jets, a move that forced ACE to cancel a $6.1 billion plane order for 18 Boeing 777s and 14 787 Dreamliners. An agreement with pilots would allow ACE to approach Boeing for another order.

Like most insurance, policies for long-term care protect against improbable events. But unlike homeowners' insurance and auto insurance, this coverage often requires a lifetime commitment to one insurer; premiums can rise sharply if the policyholder switches. And while health insurance covers immediate issues, buyers of long-term-care insurance can pay premiums for decades with no way to predict if their coverage is what they will need.  "

That turned the moribund company into a prime acquisition target. Wilbur L.

Roberts, chief executive of Lippincott Mercer, a brand consulting firm. Following are excerpts from a conversation:    Q. Aside from basic advertising and marketing, what does building a brand entail?    A. What it's all about is reaching your customer through touch points, or all the points where people interact with a product. You know about Mercedes because you've seen the ads. Or you've visited the showroom. Or your best friend has one and told you about it. Or maybe you've test-driven one. Or maybe you've owned one or two or three. There are whole different levels of knowledge. Then there is a range of different experiences -- the buying or leasing experience, the ownership experience and the ''trying to find a hard-to-find part'' experience. All of those shape your perception of Mercedes as a brand.    Q. Who's doing a really good job of branding these days?    A. Have you flown on Virgin? They do a spectacular job. They've constructed an experience for their customers that's very different from the other airlines. They've identified the touch points. The safety video, for example, is a cartoon. When they give you the instructions to take your shoes off going down the slides, everyone in the video looks at this guy wearing cowboy boots. It's a little hipper, a little funnier than others.  "

The rate of growth was the lowest since the first half of 2002. Higher oil costs and state controls on fuel prices to curb inflation are slashing margins at Chinese refiners and making some gasoline retailers limit sales, prompting shortages. ''The refiners are being squeezed,'' Philip Niem, Asian investment strategist at Barclays Bank in Hong Kong, said. ''Crude oil prices are increasing so rapidly, it's hard for the Chinese government to keep up.'' Snopec's refining business had an operating loss of 1.3 billion yuan, swinging from a profit of 4.3 billion yuan a year earlier.

PKF Consulting says that room rates paid in May averaged $386.15 in the top-luxury category in Manhattan, a 15.1 percent increase over May 2004. Occupancy in that category was 88.6 percent -- up 4 percent. It can be difficult to find a hotel room in New York at any price. For Manhattan hotels in all price categories, the average occupancy rate was 89.6 percent in May (up 4.5 percent from May 2004). The average rate paid for a room was $240.23, up 12.6 percent from $213.30 in May 2004.    JETS BY THE HOUR -- Now there is a 10-hour card for buying private jet service. Through Sept. 30, Delta AirElite, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, is selling 10 hours of flight time on various private jets, rather than the usual 20-hour or 25-hour commitment. The new program, called Perfect 10, costs $41,400 for 10 hours in a light jet, $59,900 for midsize jets and $102,900 for large jets, a Delta spokeswoman said. Delta said the program was a way to allow its new private-jet customers to experience hourly membership at a low level of commitment.    HURRICANE WAIVERS -- Because of Hurricane Dennis, most domestic airlines are waiving penalties for changing flights to and from most airports in Florida. The time limits for making changes on nonrefundable tickets without penalty vary, and were posted yesterday on airlines' Web sites.    FEWER EMPTY SEATS -- Feeling a little pinched in the air? Airline domestic load factors -- the percentage of seats filled by paying customers -- hit records in June. Here are some examples of how crowded flights were on average: American Airlines, 84.2 percent; United Airlines, 88 percent; Delta Air Lines, 80.9 percent. US Airways does not break out domestic load factors, but its overall load factor in June, including international flights, was 81.2 percent. Southwest Airlines reported a slight drop in its load factor in June, to 76.2 percent, which was attributed to a sharp increase -- 13.5 percent -- in the number of seats available compared with June 2004.    MILEAGE CUT FOR REWARDS -- American Airlines said yesterday it was cutting the number of frequent-flier miles needed to book free travel for short hops on its Web site, AA.com. From Sept. 1 through next Feb. 28, round-trip reward tickets for flights under 750 miles (one way) will require 15,000 frequent-flier miles, a reduction of 10,000 miles from the current requirement. First-class and business-class reward tickets on such routes will require 30,000 miles, a reduction of 15,000.    YES, WE HAVE NO PRETZELS -- Looking to trim more costs, US Airways said it would eliminate bags of free pretzels on its flights starting in September, after a similar move by Northwest Airlines last month."

But even as the surge in prices appeared to be easing, policy makers and consumer groups nationwide increased calls for a host of government interventions to punish profiteers, reduce gas taxes and institute price caps. [Page C1.]    Opening a series of Congressional hearings on soaring fuel prices, the Senate energy committee vented bipartisan wrath at allegations of energy-company profiteering. [C5.]    Governments across Asia are overhauling energy policies in response to high world prices for gasoline and diesel, cutting subsidies and raising local prices in moves that could curb demand and help bring down global prices in the months ahead. [C5.]    Toyota Poised to Benefit From Higher Gas Prices  With Hurricane Katrina pushing American gas prices above $3 a gallon at the pump, Toyota may find itself in the right place at the right time, with a new, half-mile assembly line in Japan capable of producing gasoline-electric hybrid Prius cars at the rate of one a minute. [C1.]    In Katrina's Wake, an Electric Utility Proves Resilient  Entergy, the electric utility that serves New Orleans and other portions of the region damaged by Hurricane Katrina, indicated that despite the widespread death and damage, shareholders could expect no more than a slight, temporary dip in profits. That is partly because New Orleans represents only a small portion of Entergy's revenues, and partly because some lingering effects of the hurricane could benefit other Entergy business operations. Market Place. [C10.]    U.S. Budget Plans Are Endangered as Storm's Costs Rise  Hurricane Katrina is about to blow a hole in the federal budget, and it is already jeopardizing President Bush's agenda for cutting taxes and reducing the deficit. Administration officials told Republican lawmakers that relief efforts were running close to $700 million a day, and that the total federal cost could reach as high as $100 billion. [A22.]    Shipping Begins Its Return to the Gulf Region  In fits and starts, the shipping business in the Gulf region is coming back to life. In the past few days, a handful of ships laden with American grain have been steaming out of the mouth of the Mississippi River, headed for overseas markets. And dozens of vessels full of imports have been steering away from New Orleans and other damaged cities to unload at other ports eager for the business. [C1.]    Mississippi's Casinos Not Ready to Fold  Several Mississippi casinos -- all were built on barges because by state law they must float on water -- were lifted by the rising waters of Hurricane Katrina and flung to land, where they were smashed into pieces. That kind of devastation might persuade other businesses to close permanently. But the gambling industry is not just any business. [C1.]    Prosecutors Plan to Expand Inquiry Into Tax Shelters  Federal prosecutors said they planned to file new charges and name as many as a dozen new defendants in their investigation of questionable tax shelters sold by the accounting firm KPMG. Prosecutors described the widening criminal investigation at the arraignment of nine former executives. [C1.]    Investment Firm Sues Over New York Investigation  J.&W. Seligman & Company, a New York-based investment firm, filed suit against the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, contending that he had overstepped his authority in his investigation of improper trading in Seligman's mutual funds. Seligman is one of the few mutual fund managers that has yet to reach a settlement regarding market timing in its funds. Market timing -- the rapid trading in and out of mutual funds -- has been the focus of an investigation made public by Mr. Spitzer, above, two years ago this week. [C8.]    NBC News President Says He Will Step Down  Neal Shapiro, who led NBC News through the Sept. 11 terror attacks and the conflict in Iraq, and who oversaw the first anchor succession on a network nightly newscast in nearly a quarter-century, announced that he was resigning as president of the news division, effective Friday. In an e-mail message to the news staff, Mr. Shapiro expressed a yearning to return to a hands-on role. [C2.]    Stocks Rise Strongly as Energy Futures Fall  Stocks rose strongly as futures prices of crude oil and gasoline fell and an index of business activity in services showed strength well beyond expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 141.87 points, to 10,589.24. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.37 points, to 1,233.39. The Nasdaq composite index increased 25.79 points, to 2,166.86. [C11.]    Investigators Fault Handling of U.N.

An investor group led by Formation Capital had raised its offer for Beverly Enterprises to $12.90 a share in cash, which was higher than overtures it previously made and exceeded the $12.80-a-share deal the nursing home company sealed on Wednesday with North American Senior Care. Traders said that the two offers were so close in value that North American Senior Care could return with a higher bid, creating a bidding war for Beverly, which operates 345 nursing homes, and assisted-living and hospice centers. (Reuters)    Dillard's Posts Narrower Loss  The department store Dillard's said that its second-quarter loss narrowed, while AnnTaylor Stores said that profit declined and margins would widen in the second half. Shares of both companies rose. Dillard's net loss was $12.3 million compared with $26 million a year earlier on a 1.2 percent sales gain. Profit at AnnTaylor dropped 76 percent as revenue rose 7.6 percent. Dillard's same-store sales -- in stores open at least a year -- increased 1 percent, the first gain in five quarters, after it added upscale merchandise like lingerie by Calvin Klein. AnnTaylor's profit excluding a relocation expense exceeded analysts' estimates. Shares of Dillard's rose $1.49, to $22.09. AnnTaylor increased $1.56, to $26.60.

(Bloomberg News)    Bribery Accusation Hurts Brazil's Markets  Brazil's stocks and currency tumbled after São Paulo state prosecutors said the finance minister, Antonio Palocci, left, might have taken bribes as a mayor in the 1990's. Rogerio Buratti, an aide to Mr. Palocci when he was the mayor of Ribeirão Preto in the 1990's, testified to state prosecutors that Mr. Palocci received 50,000 reais ($20,362) a month from a company in charge of the city's trash collection. Mr. Palocci, who is considered the architect of Brazil's economic reform, denied the charges in a Finance Ministry statement. Ricardo Campos, who helps manage $4.1 billion of assets for Hedging-Griffo Asset Management, said, ''The problem is that Palocci is the man carrying the economic policy,'' adding, ''It's all that the market was concerned about.'' The currency weakened as much as 3.6 percent to the dollar, and settled down 2.1 percent to 2.4486. The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell as much as 2.9 percent, but ended down 0.9 percent, to 26,643.77. (Bloomberg News)    Home Depot Management Change  Home Depot, the home-improvement retailer, said that its chief of stores in the United States and Mexico, Tom Taylor, would replace John Costello as chief of marketing and merchandising. Mr. Taylor joined Home Depot in 1983. Mr. Costello, who was hired in November 2002, left to pursue other opportunities, the company said in a statement. (Bloomberg News)    Work-Hour Rules Revised  The Transportation Department issued revised work-hour rules for highway truck drivers, keeping provisions of earlier regulations that a federal court threw out last year. The department had to revise the rules, which raised maximum daily driving hours to 11, from 10, after groups like Public Citizen told a federal court in July 2004 that the government failed to show that drivers could stay alert with the added hour. The new regulations retain the 11-hour daily limit, as well as 10 hours of rest every 24 hours. (Bloomberg News)    Maytag to Cut 200 Jobs  Maytag, the appliance maker, is cutting about 16 percent -- about 200 jobs -- of the work force at its Newton, Iowa, washer and dryer plant.

My debit card was still in my wallet. I hadn't used it in days. The bank said thieves might have created a counterfeit card. Someone -- a store clerk, waiter, whoever -- could have used a card reader to harvest the information imbedded in the magnetic strip to create a fake one.

In New York, stocks actually closed higher, shaking off early declines. [Page C1.]    The London Stock Exchange remained open after the terrorist attacks, though the market closed lower after setting a trading volume record. [C7.]    Experts said photographs from the London attacks, taken with cellphone cameras and digital cameras, were posted online in greater numbers and with greater speed than they had seen in past major events. [A12.]    The airline industry is trying to remain positive in the aftermath of the London bombings. But that did not seem easy yesterday. [A14.]    Retired Morgan Chief's Exit Package Disclosed  Morgan Stanley disclosed that its board awarded Philip J. Purcell, who retired as chief executive and chairman after a bitter struggle for control of the firm, an exit package worth an estimated $113.7 million. [C1.]    Omnicare to Buy Rival for $1.55 Billion  The nursing home drug provider Omnicare has agreed to buy its rival, NeighborCare, for $1.55 billion in cash, creating an institutional pharmacy behemoth. Earnings at the two companies are significantly dependent on Medicare, the federal program that provides insurance for the elderly and disabled. In 2006, the program will begin paying for prescription drugs for its 43 million members. [C9.]    Retailers' Sales Show Increases for June  Nearly across the board, retail sales increased in June, from luxury to midmarket to discount. The reasons were varied: hotter weather, hotter fashion, more markdowns and less concern about gas prices than experts had anticipated. [C1.]    Family Pursues a Tax Shelter Case  Among the civil lawsuits filed by dozens of individuals against the accounting firm KPMG over sham tax shelters, one case stands out because of its size -- $188 million -- and because it is a rare example of an entire family buying a bogus shelter. [C1.]    Chip Maker Gets Its Story, and Its Name, Out Front  Hector Ruiz, left, chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, would like you to understand exactly why his company is suing Intel, its larger and much-better-known rival. Short of that, he would like to make sure that at least you have heard of A.M.D. To do this, A.M.D., the second-largest maker of chips for personal computers, took out full-page ads last week in several national newspapers. Advertising. [C5.]    Broker Faces Retrial on Trading-Related Charges  Theodore C. Sihpol III, a former Bank of America broker who was acquitted last month on 29 of 33 criminal charges that he engaged in improper trading of mutual funds, faces a retrial on the four counts on which jurors could not agree, lawyers in the case said. [C3.]    Drug Companies Campaign Against California Measure  Pharmaceutical companies are pouring tens of millions of dollars into a campaign to defeat a measure on the November ballot in California that would pressure them to lower drug prices for millions of people. [A16.]    NitroMed, the company that broke new ground by winning federal approval for the first drug intended for African-Americans, may now be entering new territory with a controversial pricing system for the medicine. [C3.]    New Claims for Jobless Benefits Rise  The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment insurance benefits rose by 7,000 to 319,000 last week, with a significant portion of the rise related to temporary layoffs in the auto and school sectors, the Labor Department said. [C9.]    Schwab Says It Plans to Stay Independent  The Charles Schwab Corporation, the discount broker, said it had no interest in being acquired after its shares surged on speculation that it might be a takeover candidate. [C7.]    Credit Card Processor Hires Security Auditor  CardSystems Solutions, the credit card payment processor at the center of one of the biggest data breaches in recent history, said that it had hired a security auditor and that it hoped to comply with the industry's security standards by the end of August. [C4.]    Wary Eastern Europeans Look to Russia Again  When the Soviet Union collapsed, so did trade between Russia and the Eastern European countries it had so long controlled.

At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, international flights are scheduled to begin operating Saturday from the $1.7 billion, two-million-square-foot Terminal D. The airport was ranked sixth in the world last year in passenger traffic (after Atlanta Hartsfield, Chicago O'Hare, London Heathrow, Tokyo Haneda and Los Angeles International). But the opening of a $438 million terminal at Southwest Florida International Airport scheduled for tomorrow has been delayed to allow the completion of last-minute work and federal certification of baggage handling systems. A new date has not been set for the opening of the terminal, which will replace a 22-year-old building. The airport serves the booming Fort Myers-Cape Coral region.    NEWARK FARE WAR -- After JetBlue Airways announced last week that it would begin service in October from Newark Liberty International Airport to destinations in Florida, Continental Airlines, the dominant carrier at Newark, announced a $69 one-way fare sale and said it would add eight daily round-trip flights (for a total of 35) on Newark-to-Florida routes in October. JetBlue had set its introductory fares to and from five Florida cities at $69. Southwest Airlines said it would begin service in October from Southwest Florida International Airport with nine daily nonstop flights to Baltimore-Washington, Chicago Midway, Long Island-Islip, Orlando and Philadelphia. One-way advance purchase fares range from $29 to $79.    GLOBE TROTTERS -- Underscoring a surge in trans-Atlantic traffic this summer, the number of passengers on flights to Europe increased 6 percent in June from a year earlier on the top nine trans-Atlantic airlines, according to the Donald N. Martin Company. Most of the growth came from traffic originating in Europe, with the number of American travelers up just 1.5 percent, the company said. Planes were full, with an average 87.9 percent of seats filled by paying customers. Among United States airlines, the biggest trans-Atlantic traffic gains in June were on Continental (29 percent), Delta Air Lines (21.7 percent) and American (16.9 percent). The skies are even more crowded this month, according to OAG Worldwide, a travel information provider, which said the number of scheduled flights to and from North America had jumped 5,000 from last July, to 128,573.    HOTELS BUSIER -- In another indication of the rebound in the domestic hotel industry, PricewaterhouseCoopers says hotel employment will reach 1.8 million this year, only slightly less than the 1.84 million peak in 2000. Last year, after three consecutive years of job losses, the picture began brightening with a 1.2 percent growth rate over 2003. But hotels continue to cut costs even as they add rooms. This year, the industry will have about 63 employees per 100 occupied rooms, compared with 70 in 2001 and a record 75 in 1988. ''Productivity remains extremely high,'' said Bjorn Hanson of the lodging division at PricewaterhouseCoopers.    STROLLING DOWN THE AISLES -- Passengers can now get out of their seats within 30 minutes after departure from or 30 minutes before arrival at Reagan Washington National Airport. Responding to a directive from Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, the Transportation Security Administration dropped a rule, imposed shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks, requiring passengers to remain seated during the 30-minute approach to or departure from the airport, which is close to the White House and the Capitol.    NEW NONSTOP LONG HAULS -- American Airlines will begin daily nonstop service between Chicago O'Hare and New Delhi on Nov. 15. India ''is one of the fastest-growing international markets for both passenger and cargo traffic,'' said Henry C. Joyner, American's senior vice president for planning. The route, to be flown with 236-seat Boeing 777-200 jets, is about 7,500 miles and will be American's longest nonstop flight. In April, Continental Airlines said it would start daily nonstop service between Newark and New Delhi on Oct. 31, also on Boeing 777's. That route, at 7,300 miles, would be second in length to Continental's 8,060-mile New York-to-Hong Kong service. And Emirates said it would add a second daily nonstop flight between Kennedy International Airport and Dubai starting Nov. 7, using A340-500 aircraft from Airbus. JOE SHARKEY  "

No, this is not the first line of an absurdist joke. The serious answer, courtesy of the product development team at Zyliss USA, a kitchen tools maker, is that neither item is useful on its own.

Socks often vanish in the tumble dryer; corn holders tend to go mysteriously astray during the journey from picnic table back to the utensil drawer. To make matters worse, according to Patrice Gerber, Zyliss USA's director of worldwide product development, searching for a misplaced holder can be painful -- literally. ''Corn holders are pretty sharp at the tip,'' Mr. Gerber said. ''If you go fumbling around your drawer looking for one of these, you might hurt yourself.''  "

That is not good news for international carriers based in the United States. Their business-class products are generally viewed as inferior to those on foreign airlines like British Airways and Cathay Pacific. In all, 70.5 percent of those polled said they preferred the premium cabins on foreign carriers to those on domestic ones.    FARES STILL LOW -- Underscoring the revenue pressures faced by domestic airlines, the average domestic air fare paid by business travelers in the second quarter was 7 percent less than in the year-earlier period, according to the American Express Business Travel Monitor. The average one-way fare paid in the second quarter of 2005 was $218. The average was calculated by tracking fares for 329 pairs of cities as paid by clients of American Express Business Travel, the travel management unit of American Express. Average international fares rose 6 percent in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period, American Express said. In the second quarter of 2000, the average one-way domestic fare was $218.    NO CELLPHONES! -- An overwhelming majority of the more than 674,000 travelers who responded to an online survey by Skytrax, a research firm, said they ''strongly opposed'' permitting cellphone use on long or short flights, the company said.    LOUNGE DEAL -- Is lifetime membership in American Airlines Admirals Club airport lounges worth $5,500? The airline, a unit of AMR, is about to find out after announcing the offer, which is good through Dec. 31. American's more than 40 clubs around the world offer workstations, copiers, fax machines and snacks, but in recent years have replaced free drinks with cash bars. New annual memberships cost $300 to $450.    BRITONS LOVE NEW YORK -- British travelers rate New York as the best city in the world, according to a survey of 4,000 travelers in Britain by the advertising agency Leo Burnett Worldwide in partnership with the British polling firm YouGov. The rest of the top 10: Sydney, London, Barcelona, Paris, Rome, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Toronto and San Francisco. The survey rated cities in categories including cultural ""buzz"" and perceived attractiveness as a destination.    MASSAGE MESSAGE -- This is not a joke: Hyatt Hotels is promoting a massage ''catering to the tech-savvy business traveler'' who gets a sore thumb from excessive use of hand-held electronic devices like the BlackBerry. The BlackBerry Balm Hand Massage, available at HyattPure spas, consists of 30 minutes of stretching of the hands and arms.    GAS AND TAXES -- Reacting to the recent sharp rise in gasoline prices, the Internal Revenue Service has raised the deduction for business use of a vehicle. The rate is 48.5 cents a mile for the final four months of this year, from 40.5 cents for the first eight months and 37.5 cents last year. The I.R.S. said it would set rates for 2006 at the end of this year rather than in the fall because of uncertainty about gas prices.   JOE SHARKEY  "

Banco Bilbao withdrew its offer of 6.5 billion euros for Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which is based in Rome, hours before the deadline as it became clear that fewer than 1 percent of shares had been tendered. ABN Amro let its offer of 6.3 billion euros for Banca Antonveneta based in northeastern Italy, run its course, but received only about 2.2 percent of Antonveneta's shares, bringing its total stake to 27.2 percent.

The company, based in New York and Paris, said revenue rose 21 percent, to $3.43 billion. Excluding gains related to final payments from the sale of a semiconductor business two years ago, Schlumberger earned $473.2 million, or 78 cents a share in the quarter, beating analysts' expectations of 67 cents. Shares of Schlumberger rose $4.32 yesterday, or 5.5 percent, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Abramovich, left, the owner of the Chelsea soccer club in Britain, paid more taxes after President Vladimir V. Putin demanded that businesses stop minimizing payments to the budget and tax collection tightened. The Yukos Oil Company takeover of Sibneft collapsed last year as the government levied $28 billion in tax claims against Yukos. Income-tax payments soared to $874.7 million, from $183.8 million, increasing the tax burden to 30 percent, from 7 percent, last year, the company said.

The jury said his family should receive $229 million in punitive damages and $24.4 million in actual damages. Last September, the company pulled Vioxx from the market after a study showed it significantly increased the risk of heart attack or stroke among patients who took the drug for at least 18 months.

Mr. Volcker, who heads the independent committee investigating the United Nations oil-for-food program in Iraq, was not talking about the program per se, but about corruption in general.      A new study by Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, sheds light on just how much corruption could have taken place in exchange for oil sales in the oil-for-food program. Although their estimate greatly exceeds the Central Intelligence Agency's figure, the amount of kickbacks and political favors given for lucrative oil deals was still fairly limited, probably no more than 3 percent of the total oil revenue collected, they concluded.

The White House said it would release emergency oil stockpiles to meet shortages and would relax environmental standards nationwide. [Page A1.]    After one of the worst storms ever to hit the Gulf Coast, large parts of the nation's distribution system had shut down, slowing down imports and exports. One result could be that American consumers will be paying more for everything from coffee and bananas to paint and tires. [C1.]    From as far away as Massachusetts and Ohio, convoys of utility trucks and reinforcement workers are descending on the storm-damaged region to restore electricity to the estimated 1.7 million household and business customers still without power. [C1.]    Landline and wireless phone service across the Gulf Coast from New Orleans eastward has been largely cut off, and work to restore it is going to take weeks, if not months. [C7.]    Drivers Begin Turning Away From Big S.U.V.'s  Consumers nationwide are gradually shifting away from large sport utility vehicles toward smaller, more fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s and cars.

[C4.]    Client Switches Account, Dealing a Blow to Interpublic  The troubled Interpublic Group of Companies was dealt a serious blow when one of its largest clients, Bank of America, dismissed Interpublic and shifted its consolidated account, with total spending estimated at $600 million, to the Omnicom Group. The account shift is one of the largest in advertising in recent years. Interpublic has been plagued by financial and operational problems since 2002. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C3.]    Hedge Fund Company's Brokerage Arm Draws Attention  Over the last two and a half years, Bayou Securities, the brokerage unit of Bayou Group, the Connecticut hedge fund company at the center of a growing investigation, generated $51.5 million in revenue executing trades for its four affiliated hedge funds. Such revenues seem excessive for a small firm like Bayou, hedge fund experts said. [C1.]    Stocks Climb After Fed Official Comments on Rates  Stocks climbed yesterday, rising after the president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve signaled that the central bank could change its interest rate policy in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Falling oil prices also helped stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.78 points, to 10,481.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.92 points, to 1,220.33, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.33 points, to 2,152.09. [C11.]    MasterCard Plans to Take Itself Public  MasterCard announced plans to pursue an initial public offering that could value the credit card company at more than $10 billion. [C1.]    F.D.A. Approves Drug for Children's Growth  The Food and Drug Administration gave approval to the first new drug in 30 years for the treatment of abnormally short stature in children. It is the first drug approved for Tercica, a biotechnology company based in Brisbane, Calif. An estimated 6,000 children in this country have the specific condition for which the F.D.A. approved the drug, although some doctors expect it to be more broadly prescribed to children with less severe growth abnormalities. [C5.]    As health officials worked to avoid another flu vaccine shortage like that in the 2004-5 season, regulators approved a flu shot from GlaxoSmithKline, and a Chiron vaccine plant in Liverpool that was shut last year because of contamination moved closer to being opened.

In the face of the turmoil, the government stepped up its release of strategic oil stocks to refiners. [Page C1.]    All across the country dealers posted eye-popping gasoline prices yesterday, reflecting panic in both dealers and consumers not seen since the days immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Novartis already owns 42 percent of Chiron, the world's second-largest producer of flu vaccines. In 2004, British regulators forced the closing of Chiron's factory in Liverpool because of quality problems, which led to a flu vaccine shortfall in the United States last year.

The fare, based on purchase yesterday afternoon of a round-trip ticket leaving New York Tuesday and returning Thursday, was listed on the Song Web site at $554.90. On the Delta Web site, the fare for a Delta flight -- using the same dates and itinerary and same purchase conditions -- was one penny more.    IT'S BACK -- Airport congestion, that is. During the first two weeks of June, flight arrival delays were up sharply at many hub airports, according to the inspector general's office of the Transportation Department. Based on the percentage of delays, the average length of delays (just over one hour) and the projected growth in passenger traffic, the agency listed the following as the top six ''airports to watch'' for potential major disruptions -- and possible federal intervention -- this summer: Atlanta (34.8 percent of flights delayed June 1-15); Newark (33.4 percent); Philadelphia (32.6 percent); Fort Lauderdale (31.6 percent); Washington-Dulles (30.1 percent); and La Guardia (28.2 percent). At Chicago's O'Hare, usually a major center for summer delays, the government has already reached agreement with airlines to limit flights through the fall.    BERLIN EXPRESS -- Continental Airlines started daily nonstop service last week between Liberty International Airport in Newark and Tegel Airport in Berlin. That follows a move by Delta Air Lines last May to resume nonstop service between Kennedy International Airport and Tegel. Before May, there had been no nonstop service between the United States and the German capital since Lufthansa dropped a Washington to Berlin route shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks. In 1998, Delta dropped a previous route between New York and Berlin, citing low passenger traffic. Continental said its new service was the latest in an aggressive international route expansion.    TRAVEL TO CUBA -- Virgin Atlantic is to begin twice-weekly nonstop service Thursday between London and Havana. The airline said the new flights were in response to a surge in British tourism and business travel to Cuba. Last year, more than 160,000 British travelers visited Cuba, up from 46,000 in 1997, Virgin said. Meanwhile, American travelers continue to be barred from visiting Cuba. In Congress last week, the House voted to retain a trade embargo imposed in 1960 that bans most travel between the United States and Cuba.    MANHATTAN TRANSFER -- There is a new corporate flag flying at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces last week assumed management of the Pierre, the fashionable Fifth Avenue hotel, from Four Seasons Hotels. With its high land prices and dearth of space for new development, New York has long posed a challenge for foreign five-star hotel companies seeking to establish their brand, and acquiring existing hotels is seen as the most efficient way in. ''Taj Hotels has been searching for such a property for some time,'' said Raymond Bickson, the managing director of Indian Hotels, which operates the Taj hotels. Taj plans a $35 million renovation at the Pierre, which opened in 1930.   JOE SHARKEY  "

But rising consumption and capital spending in Japan suggest it may be revving up its motor, too. A spate of reports on economic activity in July that are due out in Tokyo this week -- the unemployment rate and retail sales today, automobile production and automobile exports tomorrow and construction orders and industrial production on Wednesday -- should give a clearer picture of whether the Asian giant is waking up.    TOO INCHOATE TO CALL -- Gassing up the S.U.V. is getting expensive, and the value of your house might be about to turn south. Glass half empty. On the other hand, the economy is humming along. Glass half full. The monthly measure of Americans' economic anxiety level comes out tomorrow, and whatever it shows, it will not be a trend. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell last month after rising in June, rising in May and falling in April. (Last Friday, the University of Michigan's monthly survey showed a sharper-than-expected drop in consumer sentiment, so brace yourselves.) Three other gauges of our collective material well-being -- figures on personal income (expected to be flat), personal spending (expected to be up 0.2 percent) and jobless claims -- follow on Thursday.    COMING INDICATORS -- Then there are macroeconomic numbers: factory orders for July, due out tomorrow; preliminary G.D.P. growth for the second quarter and preliminary corporate profits on Wednesday; construction spending for July on Thursday; and then the big one, the August unemployment rate, on Friday. It will probably remain at 5 percent, though Bloomberg News said the median forecast of the economists it surveyed called for an increase of 190,000 jobs. Taken together, the reports are unlikely to be surprising enough to move the stock market out of its current meandering in the neighborhood of 10,500.    REST STOP -- Auto sales for the month will also be announced on Thursday, and are expected to be down sharply from the blowout months of June and July. General Motors, which cleared out much of its inventory by using employee-discount pricing for all comers, is likely to report a big drop in sales, while Ford stands to gain. The Big Three are still offering employee-price promotions, but the sizzle has faded. August sales figures from leading retailers are also due out Thursday; some disappointing results last month were attributed to consumers spending more time and money in car lots than in malls.  THE O.C. SINGERS -- Is there such a thing as an O.C. effect? The popular Fox teenage drama ''The O.C.'' has spawned several successful soundtrack albums featuring music by bands like Nada Surf and the Dandy Warhols, which are not typically heard on prime time (or on MTV, for that matter). One of the best known ''O.C.'' bands, Death Cab for Cutie, releases its new album, ''Plans,'' tomorrow, providing a test case for a possible crossover effect on sales.

Despite Commitment to Negotiate  The United States government took its dispute over government aid for the European airplane maker Airbus SAS back to the World Trade Organization, just two weeks after officials indicated they were committed to negotiating a solution. The United States Trade Representative's Office in Washington said it made its request on Thursday to begin legal proceedings on its Oct. 6 complaint that European government loans to Airbus amount to an illegal subsidy and should be stopped. The European Union has a countersuit, claiming the Boeing Company receives unfair financial incentives. The two governments had been trying since October to avoid a W.T.O. confrontation. The most recent attempt at talks broke down May 31 because of differences over a timetable to phase out the use of financial incentives and launch aid, according to past statements from the trade ministers. (Bloomberg News)    United Airlines said yesterday that it would submit a plan next month to exit bankruptcy this fall.

United said it planned to submit two documents that would spell out how it would settle claims with lenders and other parties and detail its business model. UAL asked in its filing for the court to schedule a hearing in early September to approve a disclosure statement, which will detail United's current business and sketch out its financial model.

The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association said yesterday that its members at Northwest would be sent ballots and have until 10 a.m. July 19 to cast their votes on whether to authorize a strike. They agreed to consider wage cuts last month and have proposed a package that the airline, based in Egan, Minn., contends falls short of what it needs. (AP)    The America West Holdings Corporation's proposal to merge with the US Airways Group and bring it out of bankruptcy protection did not attract any competing bids, clearing a hurdle to its planned completion in about three months. No other offers were submitted before the deadline of 5 p.m. yesterday set by Judge Stephen Mitchell of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, Va., US Airways said. The proposal still needs approvals by creditors, the bankruptcy court, America West shareholders and the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. US Airways, based in Alexandria, Va., filed its plan on Thursday to leave court protection through the America West merger, a deal that would be financed by $1.5 billion from outside investors, suppliers and others. (Bloomberg News)    Citigroup Completes Sale of Travelers to MetLife  Citigroup said it completed the sale of its Travelers Life & Annuity insurance businesses to MetLife Inc. and will realize a gain of about $2 billion in its third quarter. Citigroup said it received about $10.8 billion in cash and $1 billion in MetLife's common shares. The $2 billion represents an after-tax gain. MetLife said it expected the deal to provide a modest addition to earnings in the second half of 2005. MetLife agreed to buy Travelers from Citigroup on Jan. 31. (Reuters)    Stun Gun Maker Accuses Newspaper Publisher of Libel  The stun gun maker Taser International Inc. said yesterday that it had filed a libel lawsuit against USA Today's publisher, Gannett Company, for publishing an article that Taser said misled readers about the safety of its products. Taser, which has been under scrutiny over the safety of its stun guns, said it filed suit in Arizona Superior Court accusing Gannett of libel, false light invasion of privacy, injurious falsehood and interference with business relations. Tara Connell, a spokeswoman for Gannett, said the company, based in McLean, Va., had not yet seen the complaint and did not have a comment. The lawsuit centers on a USA Today article from June 3, which Taser said overstated the level of electrical output of one of its stun guns. (AP)    Pfizer Abandons Development of Two Drugs  Pfizer Inc. said yesterday that it is abandoning development of two experimental drugs after they posted poor trial results -- an H.I.V. therapy that was in advanced studies and a treatment for asthma and lung disease that the company was developing with Altana of Germany. Pfizer said it dropped the capravirine H.I.V. drug because two studies failed to show that it significantly helped patients. The company will return rights to the compound to its developer, Shionogi & Company of Japan. Separately, Pfizer ended a collaboration with Altana on its Daxas drug, a treatment for asthma and a lung disorder that is usually caused by smoking.
