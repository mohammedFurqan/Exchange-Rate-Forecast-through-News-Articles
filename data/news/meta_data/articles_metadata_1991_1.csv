Gorbachev blamed leaders of the separatist Lithuanian Parliament and their supporters today for bringing on the Soviet military attack that killed 14 people in Vilnius on Sunday morning.    He did not disavow the attack or say that it was unjustified, but said he had found out about it only after it happened, when the local military commander sent in troops to protect a pro-Soviet ""National Salvation Committee"" that later claimed control of the Baltic republic in place of the elected legislature."

The settlement, reached on Wednesday, will drop Unocal from the lawsuit. The suit charged the six oil companies with depressing the price of oil pumped from the tidal lands around Long Beach. The settlement must still be signed by Gov. Pete Wilson and endorsed by state and Federal courts.   In addition to price fixing, the suit contended that Unocal, Chevron, Exxon, Mobil, Shell and Texaco had conspired to monopolize the production and distribution of crude oil on the West Coast. The suit was brought by the City of Long Beach in 1975."

The Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster did not disclose terms of the deal for Ticketron, which is owned by the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment group, and is based in Landover, Md. Both companies are private.    When it was formed eight years ago, Ticketmaster was the upstart that challenged the long-established Ticketron. Now Ticketmaster has become a larger cmpany, dominating sports and pop concert bookings and leaving Ticketron with few strengths except the legitimate theater business. The companies' business overlaps in many cities."

Myers's letter (""The Prevalence of Expedient Ethics,"" March 10) the author states that as a strategic planning consultant he finds corporate executives giving less attention to ethics.   I don't know Mr. Myers's views on strategic planning, but I find that the published writings of many planners place stress on achieving higher ""shareholder value"" as the prime objective of business. This view has contributed a great deal toward ignoring ethical standards. Emphasis on shareholder value ignores the interests of the other stakeholders -- customers, employees, society and the industry.   My own view, with about 45 years in business before entering the academic world, is that most corporate executives have increased their attention to ethics, and to stakeholders other than their shareholders. They know that ignoring the law can put you in jail, and that poor ethics loses business in the long run. Good ethics is good business.

To Japanese and Americans alike, the controversy reflects the tense state of relations these days, aggravated by endless trade disputes and American resentments over Japanese investments and what many officials see as Tokyo's half-hearted response to the war against Iraq."

Like all hospitals, St. Luke's cannot afford to run short of vital items -- least of all in the operating rooms. At St. Luke's, Dr. Denton A. Cooley's teams perform open heart surgery on 3,000 patients each year, using prodigious quantities of supplies.    But to achieve economies as the pressure to control costs intensified, St. Luke's shut its warehouse and sold the inventory to Baxter International, a major hospital supplier. Baxter is becoming a full-time partner with this 950-bed hospital in managing, ordering and delivering Baxter's wares as well as the products of 400 other companies. Baxter's daily ""just-in-time"" deliveries to the hospital loading dock were only the first step. In an innovative system that hospitals call stockless inventory, Baxter fills orders in exact, sometimes small, quantities and delivers directly to departments, including the operating rooms and nursing floors, inside St. Luke's.   At least 50 hospitals buy stockless services from Baxter and a handful of smaller distributors. Converts to the concept are multiplying. About 250 more hospitals will go stockless in at least some departments in the next two years, said Pat Dolan, a partner in Chicago with Arthur Andersen & Company. Dolan recently studied stockless systems for the Health Industry Distributors Association.  Industry Leaders Competitors in a $15 Billion Market   The nation's 6,700 hospitals spent $15 billion last year on products like disposable gloves and gowns, sutures and therapeutic solutions. Baxter International, Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories dominate the market. Baxter is the largest manufacturer of hospital supplies, with 29 percent of the market, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. J. & J.'s share is 11 percent, and Abbott Laboratories has about 10 percent.   Baxter is also the leading distributor, with 28 percent of that market. The company says it makes 70 percent of the products it sells. But Baxter is also a middleman for many of its manufacturing rivals; it is Johnson & Johnson's largest customer for hospital supplies. J. & J.'s hospital products unit makes one-third of its sales directly to hospitals but, unlike Baxter, does not distribute supplies for other companies. Other major suppliers include Owens & Minor Inc. in Glen Allen, Va., with $1.2 billion in 1990 sales; the A. Stuart Company in Greensburg, Pa., with $600 million, and the General Medical Corporation in Richmond, with $340 million, said Mr. Abramowitz.  Multiple Benefits 'Just-in-Time' Means Less Handling    Hospital supply expenses only begin with the $15 billion in purchases. ""For every dollar spent to buy a product, hospitals spend another dollar moving that product through the system,"" said David Cassak, hospitals editor with In Vivo Business and Medicine Report, a trade magazine.    Stockless systems lower hospitals' holding and handling costs. ""We think we've saved $1.5 million a year since 1988"" from just-in-time deliveries alone, said Randy Jackson, a St. Luke's vice president, with another $500,000 likely once the stockless system is fully implemented. Annual savings already have included $350,000 from reducing staff and $162,500 from eliminating inventory. The hospital has converted storeroomsto patient care and other money-generating uses.    Vernon R. Loucks Jr., Baxter's chairman, said the company is introducing the stockless service, which it calls Valuelink, at 17 large hospitals. ""We walk very carefully and slowly, because we can't afford a glitch,"" he said. ""The first morning that an operating room doesn't open, we've got a problem.""    The distributors profit from stockless services because they impose extra charges, raise prices more readily and often become a hospital's sole source of medical supplies. They typically add 3 percent to 5 percent service fees. ""Our price might be slightly higher than what the hospital used to pay us, but their total cost is reduced,"" said Glenn Dozier, the chief financial officer with Owens & Minor, whose major stockless client is the huge medical center of the University of California at Los Angeles.   By helping hospitals reduce costs through computerized ordering, just-in-time deliveries and stockless services, suppliers have been able to raise their prices by at least 5 percent per year. They have withstood pressure from Government and private insurers and the buying clout of groups like Volunteer Hospitals, which has 600 member hospitals and 190 affiliates. Mr. Abramowitz said the hospital supply market is growing by about 8 percent a year; Baxter's sales growth in 1991 will be about 11 percent. ""Stockless is Baxter's most exciting growth opportunity,"" he said.    Mr. Loucks said stockless services benefit both sides. ""We generally take about 30 percent of whatever is saved,"" he said. ""The hospital is picking up 70 percent.""   A medical supply company does not have to be Baxter's size to exploit these opportunities. Even before Baxter jumped in, smaller suppliers like the privately held Koley's Medical Supply Inc. in Omaha were providing stockless service to a handful of customers beginning in the mid-1980's. Michael P. Gittings, Koley's president, said 18 hospitals, mostly small and all within 200 miles of Omaha, buy the service. He said Koley's sales rose to $38 million this year, compared with $6 million in 1984, before it introduced the service. Being near at hand and relatively small helped Koley's make the service work. ""The hospitals have a very strong trust relationship with us,"" Mr. Gittings said.  Concern Over Conflicts Most Hospitals Remain Skeptical    The overwhelming majority of the nation's hospitals still shun stockless services. Some administrators fear that suppliers would write themselves larger orders than the hospitals needed. Administrators say group buying organizations already give them deep discounts. ""Some hospitals would not want non-employees working in sensitive areas like ordering supplies,"" said Dwight Winstead, president of the VHA Supply Company, the buying unit of Voluntary Hospitals of America. Administrators of hospitals that belong to the VHA are wary of becoming hens opening the door to an eager fox, he said. ""They feel there could be a conflict between supplying and servicing stockless and a corporate strategy to move products,"" he explained.    Some suppliers say hospitals must be on guard to realize the potential savings. ""Hospitals that don't have the internal systems and controls to manage it will be in trouble,"" said Frank J. Ryan, president of Johnson & Johnson Hospital Services, a unit of J.& J.   Hospitals also need to see whether the savings from going stockless are greater than the extra charges. ""You have to find the happy medium where the price of the product doesn't exceed the need for the service,"" said Jerome L. Stracke, an assistant vice president at the Evanston Hospital in Illinois.   One hospital may have found a way to realize many of the benefits from new delivery systems without the risks. The independent St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center in St. Paul, Minn., requires Baxter and two other suppliers to bid against each other. All three provide just-in-time deliveries to the loading dock, but the hospital takes charge of internal distribution. Michael I. Kerr, St. Paul-Ramsey's support services director, said this system keeps prices and inventory costs low, with the hospital staying in control of its supplies. Last year, as the cost of medical supplies rose nationally by 4 percent to 6 percent, his hospital's costs increased only 3 percent.   'PARTNERS' IN INVENTORY CONTROL    Steve Seide, a general manager in Houston with Baxter International, and Dave Render, his operations manager, meet every day with nurses and executives in two local hospitals. ""We talk about everything from a request to stock the new Diet Dr. Pepper to a complaint that a pest control truck is taking too long at the loading dock,"" Mr. Render said.    Mr. Seide and Mr. Render run a service that Baxter calls Valuelink at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital and Hermann Hospital. Under this stockless system, Baxter fills precise orders for supplies and delivers them just as they are needed, directly to the departments that place the orders.    ""We have become their warehouse, their central supply -- we're it,"" Mr. Seide said. As the hospitals phase in the stockless system, he said, ""all they will have left is two to three days of supplies. Then it's all up to us.""    Among other economies, stockless service has enabled Hermann Hospital to eliminate a 68,000-square-foot warehouse and St. Luke's to get rid of a 20,000-square-foot warehouse. Baxter keeps enough supplies for both institutions in an automated warehouse with only 44,000 square feet.    Baxter has used the stockless system to become a virtual partner with St. Luke's and Hermann in managing their supply flow. ""We formed teams in the hospital units, with leaders and steering committees to deal with problems,"" Mr. Render said.   Mr. Seide said Baxter can tailor its services according to the wishes of a hospital's staff. ""Seventy percent of it is good communications,"" he said. Based on a suggestion from the operating rooms, Baxter became part of the telephone voice mail system at St. Luke's. Anyone in an operating room can dial the letters RSVP to reach the company.    A suggestion by an operating room nurse at St. Luke's has helped Baxter prevent surgical mix-ups. Mr. Seide said she had noticed that Baxter's blue labels on pentalyte liquid, used to moisten and clean surgical incisions, closely resembled the blue labels on sterile water. Baxter, which says it was already planning to remedy the problem, promptly started putting black labels on pentalyte.   Mr. Seide and Mr. Render have good reasons for boasting of their progress at Hermann and St. Luke's. They are hoping to attract other Houston hospitals to their service. Analysts say that the more hospitals join, the greater the economies for Baxter.  "

The new device turns on or off on the power of just a single electron. Conventional transistors require currents many times more massive before they will turn on or off to create the binary messages of computing. The new device is constructed like a four-layer sandwich of gallium arsenide, aluminum arsenide and gallium arsenide, topped off with a metallic layer that serves as a conductor.

During NASA's Apollo space program in the 1960's and 70's, weight was a major concern because of the gravity involved in lunar missions. But in flying shuttle missions, gravity is no longer an issue. In a weightless environment, heavier, less expensive materials can be used in space suits, said the Hamilton Standards division of the United Technologies Corporation, the nation's leading maker of the suits."

The system permits Mr. Hawley, a 29-year-old software designer, to create and play complex scores on the piano, accompanied by a synthetic orchestra.    The computerized array Mr. Hawley controls is a tool for a skilled musician. But it is also a prototype of what Mr. Hawley refers to as an ""orchestra in a box"": a powerful music system that will extend to a far broader audience the ability to play synthesized instruments. And it is but one of about two dozen projects at the Media Lab to find new ways to play, record and compose music.  Although simple music synthesizers have been widely available for years, they have not been able to match the fullness and flexibility of traditional instruments. What is changing in the face of more powerful computer-based technologies is the ability to capture musical information far more subtle than the sound of a tone."

The United Parcel Service, the nation's largest package delivery service, is equipping its drivers with a new handheld computer that has an electronic stylus. Instead of signing a piece of paper with a pen, recipients will be asked to acknowledge getting their packages by using the pen-shaped nylon stylus to inscribe their signature directly on a sensitive membrane embedded in the computer.   The membrane creates an electronic image of each signature. That image accompanies information about the delivery that is recorded by the driver using the computer's keyboard or bar code scanner. At the end of the day, the driver puts the computer into a storage rack that draws the information from the small computer for transmission to U.P.S.'s data center in Paramus, N.J."

But President Bush, calling the Iraqi leader's speech ""an outrage,"" said the Iraqi forces had been defeated and were retreating. ""He is trying to claim defeat in the midst of a rout,"" President Bush said. Allied forces were attacking the Iraqis in two main thrusts: a force of 100,000 troops pushed northward deep into Iraq in an attempt to block their retreat, while a second drive was pushing farther into Kuwait to take the capital. A tank battle between Iraqis and United States marines raged at the international airport on the outskirts of Kuwait City, but other Iraqi units were reported fleeing the city. Kuwaiti resistance leaders said the fleeing Iraqis took thousands of Kuwaiti hostages with them. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES    Troops: The number of American soldiers killed in a Scud missile attack on a makeshift barracks in Saudi Arabia Monday rose to 28, with 100 wounded.

From Jan. 17 to Feb. 23, the start of the ground war, 23 Americans were reported killed in action, 34 wounded and 9 missing. Fifty Americans were listed as non-combat deaths in the operation and 105 other Americans were listed as non-combat deaths before the war.    One British soldier and 8 Arab soldiers were reported yesterday to have been killed. Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States said that to date 18 of his country's soldiers had been killed in action with 40 wounded. IRAQI FORCES    Troops: Central Command reported that allied forces had destroyed 21 Iraqi divisions or rendered them ineffective for combat. An Iraqi infantry division ranges from 10,000 to 12,000 men; at the beginning of the war, Iraq had about 545,000 soldiers in Iraq and southern Kuwait. About 12,000 Iraqi P.O.W.'s were taken prisoner, bringing the total to over 30,000.    Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States estimated the Iraqis had sustained between 85,000 to 100,000 casualties.

Now one of the world's wealthiest nations, Kuwait has seen its livelihood ruined again, its power and desalting plants destroyed, its oil wells feeding fires that blacken the skies. But few such devastated nations have ever had such gleaming prospects. With an estimated $100 billion in investments abroad, and most of its oil still securely in the ground, Kuwait has the cash and the credit for rebuilding. The Kuwaitis say the allies who fought the hardest will benefit the most; American companies have won about 70 percent of the 200 contracts signed so far. Kuwait has asked the Bechtel Group to manage the reconstruction of its oil industry, potentially a $10 billion task. Caterpillar Inc. is selling diesel engines to provide emergency power; Motorola Inc., portable telephones, and the Raytheon Company, air traffic control gear. Kuwait plans to not only rebuild but also modernize, promoting private enterprise and taking the nation another step beyond reliance on diving for pearls or drilling for oil. Kuwait would just as soon have an economy efficient enough to manage without the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian and Jordanian guest workers, whose political leanings are suspect. The War Payment Plan  Even as American companies gain contracts, the United States is likely to continue paying some costs of its Persian Gulf mission. With rebuilding expenses of $50 billion to $100 billion -- in the same range as the post-World War II Marshall Plan -- Kuwaiti borrowing could squeeze credit around the world. Many analysts suggest that payments from allies will more than cover American military expense. But Hermann F. Eilts, a former Ambassador to Egypt and Saudi Arabia who now directs the Boston University Center for International Relations, said that some nations might have second thoughts. Germany is burdened by reunification costs, he noted, and Japanese legislators are likely to renege on the Government's promises to the United States. ""When the shooting is over, they find reasons to limit their payments,"" he said. ""That means you and I are going to pay."" Return of the Oil Jitters  The war ended, but the oil jitters resumed. A barrel of crude, down sharply since the allied assault began Jan. 17, eased back up by $1.47 a barrel to $19.38 last week. Some oil traders voiced fears that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would soon agree to cut back production. And Kuwait is unlikely to resume shipping oil for several months. Iraq, who knows when? But several energy analysts said that the world has already shown it can survive a winter without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil; the longer run worries them much more. Christopher Flavin, an energy specialist at the Worldwatch Institute, said that with worldwide consumption growing and Soviet production falling, the real squeeze could come in the mid-1990's. G.N.P. Hints at Rebound  A revised estimate of the nation's output for the fourth quarter last year provided some evidence that the economy is poised for a rebound in the coming months. The Commerce Department said the the gross national product fell at an annual rate of 2 percent, compared to an initial estimate of 2.1 percent. But inventories were revised down, meaning that manufacturers would have to increase production to meet any stronger demand after the the victory in the Persian Gulf. Economists Turn Upbeat  Economists had a mind last week to emphasize the favorable aspects of statistics that still tell of a recession. Consumer confidence remained at depressing levels last month, according to the Conference Board's survey, but analysts noted that it rose for the first time since September. Purchasing managers, responding to another survey, also remained downcast, but again, not as dismal as the month before. The government's index of leading indicators fell four-tenths of 1 percent for January, the sixth straight decline, but economists tended to say that the end of the war, an expanding money supply and a rising stock market in February virtually guarantee that the next report will be more favorable. ""You are forming a bottom,"" said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at First Boston. ""There is no question about that."" She said that growth is likely to resume in mid-year. COMPANIES   Revlon on the Block?  Strip away the makeup, the multibillion-dollar estimates of his worth, and underneath, Ronald O. Perelman is a man facing a possible cash squeeze. Revlon Inc., his giant cosmetics company, is holding sales talks with Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal and Unilever, at prices estimated in the billions. Analysts say that Revlon cannot continue to pay off its heavy debts without selling assets. Selling The Daily News  The survival of the Tribune Company's Daily News now depends on finding a buyer. Talks to settle a strike collapsed last week and The News is trying to negotiate a sale to Robert Maxwell, the British publisher. The Wallenbergs Reach Out  The Wallenbergs of Sweden offered $2.27 billion last week for the portion of Saab-Scania A.B. that they do not already own. The family, which already controls Swedish companies with a market value of between $31 billion and $36 billion, is apparently preparing for Sweden's entry into the European Community and the easing of restrictions on foreign investment. Choosing an Indy Pace Car The Chrysler Corporation's manner of demonstrating patriotic fervor entails as many swerves and scrapes as a 60-mile-an-hour drive though rush-hour traffic. On Monday, Chrysler scrapped plans for its Japanese two-seater, the Dodge Stealth, to be the pace car in the Indianapolis 500. To take its place, the company is rushing out a prototype of the sinuous Dodge Viper. ""The Viper is a symbol of the can-do attitude and the technical innovation of the American auto industry,"" a Chrysler executive proclaimed. It also demonstrates the prowess of the Italian auto industry, where Lamborghini, a Chrysler subsidiary, aided in the Viper's development. Or maybe it really is an apt American symbol.  One prototype developed a cracked engine block, and Chrysler only trusts the pace car to manage a single ceremonial lap. If another car is needed during the race, Chrysler will send in the Japanese Stealth. A Looser Accounting Rein?  The four agencies that oversee the nation's banks and savings and loans recommended looser accounting standards on Friday to ease a credit crunch. Critics questioned whether the Government should weaken the rules when so many banks are in trouble. THE ECONOMY   Banks and Insurance  It's not exactly a bailout for banks. Maybe more of a siphoning operation, keeping the banking system afloat with the help of as much as $25 billion in Federal loans. Last Thursday, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, proposed a $64.4 billion, five-year plan to keep the insurance deposit fund solvent. Annual bank insurance premiums, now 19.5 cents per $100, would increase by at least 3.5 cents, or more depending on how much the fund borrows. Some features of his plan require Congressional approval, while others need only the backing of the F.D.I.C. The insurance fund, at $8.4 billion, stands at its lowest ratio to deposits since it was created during the Depression. Verdict on the Keating Five  The Senate Ethics Committee said their doings reflected ""poor judgement"" at the least, but most of the Keating Five are claiming that they have been cleared. In a statement last Wednesday, the committee accused Senator Alan Cranston of misconduct in taking contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr., an executive of a failing savings and loan. Actions by Senators Dennis DeConcini and Donald W. Riegle Jr. appeared improper, the committee said, and Senators John Glenn and John McCain had failings of judgement. ""I am, of course, relieved that I have been exonerated,"" said Senator McCain. It remains to be seen whether voters, who have been outraged over the costs of rescuing Mr. Keating's institution and hundreds of others, are equally relieved. A Lag in the Mag Trade  There's Crochet Celebrations and Girls of Outlaw Biker. Kansas City Live! and Kamikaze! and Missouri Wine Country Journal.

Government, also, should not neglect the potential applications of anthropology. In a city torn apart by incidents rooted in cultural misunderstanding, cultural awareness sounds like a good idea for all of us. Anthropology can be used as a tool to build it.    Awareness of one's own culture as well as the cultures of those one works with can aid government workers and social service providers. Cultural awareness can help mental health workers interpret the behavior of clients and choose treatment, and help managers in the public and private sectors improve the relations and performance of their workers. Every day more Asians, Hispanics, Caribbeans, Africans and others enter the workforce. Managers need knowledge of the cultural contexts of these people.    Ethnocentrism can lead to intolerance and violence. This city cannot afford either. Government should heed the example of the private sector and find ways to use cultural diversity and reduce cultural conflict.

Many carriers, including Pan American World Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, had already curbed flights to the Middle East before the fighting broke out. Those actions followed huge increases in airline insurance rates by Lloyds of London.   In addition, the major carriers' flights between Europe and the Far East are avoiding the Persian Gulf region, flying south or north of the area. Those routes add about an hour to the flights and require some planes to stop for refueling.   ""I don't believe any carrier wants to be in that part of the world with so many sorties being flown,"" said Steven E. Heydt, senior vice president of marketing at Liberty Travel, one of the largest travel agencies in the New York Area."

Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. sells generic drugs to some 300 drug wholesalers across the country as well as to the Pentagon. It is one of about 35 companies in the country that manufacture generic drugs, cheaper versions of name-brand items whose patents have expired.   Generic drug companies must apply to the F.D.A. to manufacture the cheaper drugs and prove they are equivalent in quality to the name-brand product.   Company officials discovered employees had falsely reported to the F.D.A. the amount of testing done on some drugs, a company spokesman, Daryl Johnson, said on Tuesday. He said that products currently on the market do not pose a hazard and that company investigators had found no evidence that employees had contended that a drug was effective when it was not.   But Pharmaceutical Basics will not ship any more of its products until they are all found to meet F.D.A. standards, Mr. Johnson said.   The falsified applications were not uncovered when the company was investigated by the F.D.A. last year during a wide inquiry into the generic drug industry. Company officials made the discovery and voluntarily reported the problem to the F.D.A., Mr. Johnson said. He did not disclose which drugs might be involved."

But they can be unsightly on packages that emphasize glamor, such as cosmetics, and can add clutter to advertising messages. So the Battelle Memorial Institute, a contract research firm in Columbus, Ohio, has developed a line of bar code inks that are transparent to visible light, but visible to the infrared radiation used by the scanning devices.    Because they are invisible to the human eye, the new inks can be placed anywhere on a package without interfering with the package design. More information can be added and the codes could be printed on all sides of a package, so that the information could be read regardless of the orientation of the container, speeding customers through the supermarket check-out lines. More information could also help stores keep better track of their inventories and help shippers keep track of their shipments.    ""Several bar codes on a product could provide an enormous amount of information during the inventory, manufacturing and shipping processes,"" said B. Thomas Smith, a Battelle vice president."

The recent conflict has wrought near-apocalyptic results upon the infrastructure of what had been, until January 1991, a rather highly urbanized and mechanized society. Now, most means of modern life support have been destroyed or rendered tenuous. Iraq has, for some time to come, been relegated to a pre-industrial age, but with all the disabilities of post-industrial dependency on an intensive use of energy and technology."

What happened? While the stock market sizzled, the bond market did almost as well.  An investor owning Government funds earned an annual return of 11.3 percent in the decade, while the average growth fund returned 11.5 percent.

The association attributes $5.6 billion to malpractice insurance premiums and about $15 billion to defensive tactics that doctors take, like prescribing redundant diagnostic tests.   Employers and insurers, who pay for much of the nation's medical care, support the proposals to limit the awards. And President Bush told a medical group last year: ""We've got to restore common sense and fairness to America's medical malpractice system.""

The accord with the party, Moledet, was signed just before the Sabbath, and as attention in Israel and throughout the world is focused on the gulf war. The timing was apparently intended to deaden leftist and centrist opposition to the accord and to mute protest from foreign governments.   Moledet, which means homeland in Hebrew, won seats in Parliament for the first time in 1988. The party's central platform during the election was the notion of ""transfer,"" as the expulsion of Arabs is known among some in Israel. The party believes that Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza should be removed to Jordan.   The agreement reached today gives Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir a coalition of 66 seats in Parliament, five more than needed for a majority."

No way, most mutual fund investors would probably say. And with good reason: Many were badly burned in 1990, when the average stock fund lost more than 7 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds.    But sidestepping stocks would be a big mistake, experts say. Although most believe the market hasn't hit bottom -- many expect the Dow Jones industrial average to fall to about 2,100 by mid-year and some expect an even steeper drop -- the consensus among analysts is that there will be a recovery this year. And the biggest profits always are made in the early part of a bull market, when many investors are not invested in stocks."

Bush, the President's son, be barred from working at any bank or other institution that received Federal insurance until he showed that he understood conflicts of interest.    Last month, an administrative law judge assailed Mr. Bush for what he called ""conflicts of interest"" and ""unsafe and unsound practices"" when he was a director of the Silverado Banking Savings and Loan Association in Denver. The institution's failure in 1988 has been attributed in part to unpaid loans secured by Mr. Bush to two associates. Denies Wrongdoing     Mr. Bush has denied wrongdoing and has said he would appeal the ruling.    The judge, Daniel J. Davidson, recommended the mildest disciplinary action that could be imposed. He recommended that Mr. Bush be ordered to make full disclosures about his other business ventures in future dealings with Federally insured institutions, and to uphold his responsibilities to depositors and shareholders. This is what is called a ""cease and desist"" order."

The Brooklyn Union Gas Company has created a radio commercial for its new ""care line,"" which provides assistance for the families of members of the armed forces who have billing questions or who are having financial difficulty.   The spots begin with a conversation in which a woman tells her husband that his friend will not be joining him, because his reserve unit has been activated. The spot goes on to stress the company's concern for military families and assures them that Brooklyn Union Gas will be there to help.   ""We were thinking of doing something in case the war broke out,"" said Steve Hunter, president and creative director at Moss Advertising in New York, the agency that did the spots.

In a major development last week, 11 large companies and their insurers decided to test a system in which employees and their doctors are asked about specific results of medical treatments.    Employees treated for lower back pain, for example, would be asked whether they could climb stairs, bend over to tie their shoes and do other things reflecting their health status.    The test will seek to determine whether the system is ""a useful and valid way of demonstrating accountability,"" said Bill Goss, the health-care programs manager at the General Electric Company. Large employers spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on employee health care. ""But we are not really sure whether we are getting value from it,"" said Mr. Goss, who is chairman of the group conducting the test.    The companies and insurers taking part include American Telephone and Telegraph, with the Travelers; Ameritech, with Illinois Blue Cross and Blue Shield; Digital Equipment, with Fallon Community Health Plan, Harvard Community Health Plan and Matthew Thornton Health Plan, three New England health maintenance organizations; General Electric's aerospace unit, with U.S. Healthcare, and General Motors, with Blue Cross of Missouri and St. Louis and Kaiser Permanente in Cleveland.   Other participants are Hercules, with the Intermountain group in Salt Lake City; Honeywell, with  Doctors and patients will use questionnaires developed by medical authorities for Dr. Paul Ellwood, president of Interstudy, a nonprofit research group based in Excelsior, Minn. The sponsor is the American Managed Care Association, whose members include 150 large companies that use health maintenance organizations and networks of doctors and hospitals.    During 12 months, the 11 companies will all ask employees about the same two or three medical conditions. Lower back pain, angina (heart attack) and asthma are the most likely subjects, said John Doyle, the project's coordinator at Interstudy.    Dr. Ellwood said Interstudy questionnaires were already being used in a similar project at half a dozen group medical practices across the country, including the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. The American Group Practices Association is the sponsor.    In yet another project, General Motors, Ford Motor, Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers union agreed this month to work on quality-ofcare measures with nine health maintenance organizations in southeastern Michigan. The H.M.O.'s will be required to meet certain standards and their members will be asked whether the H.M.O.'s provided satisfactory care.    The American Medical Association and several medical specialty professional groups are taking a different tack. They are developing guidelines for medical procedures and treatments that are based on a consensus of views of experienced doctors and from medical journals.    The A.M.A. says the guidelines will be parameters, leaving ample room for variations in particular cases. ""The specialty societies' fear is that if they don't develop guidelines, the Government will do it for them,"" said Dr. David M. Eddy, a professor of health policy and management at Duke University.    Indeed, Congress has already ordered Federal studies of both guidelines and medical results that the Government calls patient outcome research. ""At least we ought to know where we are getting the biggest bang for the buck without causing harm to patients,"" said Ira Raskin, an economist who is acting director of the Center for Medical Effectiveness at the Federal Public Health Service.    Hospitals are also developing practice guidelines and ""statements of expected performance,"" said Dennis O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, which accredits hospitals.    ""We used to assume that clinical judgment alone was an adequate source of truth,"" Dr. Eddy said. ""Now we have to go out there and measure the consequences of different medical activities.""    ""The problem is: How do you measure the whole spectrum of health care?"" said Margaret E. O'Kane, executive director of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a nonprofit group that accredits health maintenance organizations. ""There are whole areas where you just don't know the answers. We're all grappling for measurements."""

The two countries announced that they would pull back the remaining forces on their mutual border to create a buffer zone about half a mile wide.    The visit was the latest indication of the normalization of relations between Teheran and Baghdad, and raised further the possibility of a realignment of Iran with Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis.

A Second Setback     The shake-up at First City represents the second time that Mr. Abboud, an aggressive manager, has been asked to leave the helm of a large bank and ends his personal quest to resurrect First City, once Houston's biggest bank. It also dashes his hopes that his successful stewardship of First City would vindicate his bumpy banking career.

Disputes over airline rights can divide even friends as close as Britain and the United States. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner rejected British Airways' proposed fare cuts to the United States last Tuesday. Britain had blocked the sale by Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, both desperate for cash, of several London routes to Heathrow airport that United and American Airlines want to buy. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, flew into New York himself last week to display solicitude for the ailing airlines. The dispute is ""not about knocking Pan Am or T.W.A. out of business altogether,"" he said. He also urged timid Americans to resume traveling abroad; those who don't risk losing business, he said. What British Airways actually seeks are broader operating rights in the United States, said American analysts. Problem is, that sort of deal might normally take a year to work out; T.W.A. and Pan Am need agreements within a few months.  Oddball Salary Inequities  When Babe Ruth was asked, about 60 years ago, why he deserved $80,000 when President Hoover only made $75,000, Ruth's legendary response was, ""I had a better year than he did."" A week ago, Roger Clemens signed a four-year contract giving him a record average of $5.4 million a year; President Bush draws $200,000. Clemens won 21 games, holding opponents to an average of less than two runs a game. George Bush showed quick reflexes in the Persian Gulf but bobbled the tax issue. So Clemens did have the better year. But 27 times better? Enough so that the cost of a single Clemens victory more than covers Bush's salary for an entire season? And the President certainly outplayed, say, Jeff Parrett, the Atlanta Braves pitcher, who recently settled for $855,000 after winning five, losing 10. Memo to team owners wanting to economize: draft George, the former Yale baseball captain, when his Washington contract is up. Alcohol-Fed Inflation Economists have found another fuel to blame for increasing wholesale inflation. A record 5.9 percent jump in alcohol prices raised the core inflation rate in January by five-tenths of 1 percent. Higher alcohol taxes do not figure into producer prices, but many manufacturers took the chance to raise their own prices. Some economists said that, even after accounting for liquor costs, the rising core rate would keep the Federal Reserve from easing further. ""The Fed will rest on its oars for at least a couple more weeks,"" said Irwin L. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The broader inflation rate, including food and energy, fell one-tenth of 1 percent, as oil prices declined. Golden Arch of Catfish?  McDonald's believes it has found a recipe for Southern success: The Crispy Catfish Sandwich, a 2.3-ounce patty with lettuce and tangy sauce on a bun. McDonald's plans to sell it at 214 outlets in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Tennessee. Restaurants that specialize in catfish are hardly trembling. Don Buckner, general manager of Hall's on the River in Winchester, Ky., described McDonald's seafood sandwiches as ""block pieces of fish"" -- suitable for someone who would otherwise have a quarter-pounder. His $9.95 all-you-can-eat catfish dinner includes vegetables and hush puppies, he added. No hush puppies at McDonald's, said a spokeswoman, convinced that Southern customers will accept french fries. Competition for Cellular Lines All that static on the cellular phone lines is coming from aggrieved duopolists. The Federal Communications Commission decided on Wednesday to allow a new form of mobile service in six cities, including New York. Radio dispatch companies for taxis and delivery services will be able to squeeze thousands of other customers into their narrow slices of the radio spectrum. Cellular services that have flourished under rules allowing only two in each city could find competition heating up. Analysts doubt the new service, to be offered initially by Fleet Call Inc. of Bloomfield, N.J., will match cellular's flexibility and features. But the cellular industry called the decision unfair and threatened a fight. Production Declines Ease The slump in industrial output continued for a fourth month in January, but the decline was a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent after much steeper drops in the two previous months. Some economists said the report hints that the worst of the recession is past. But industries used only 79.9 percent of their capacity, the least in four years. In Brief A seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in already lean business inventories in December gave economists hope that any increase in demand would result in higher production. Citibank, long aloof and superior, has decided to join the automated teller machine masses. Its machines will become part of the Cirrus network, sharing access with machines from 7,200 other banks and financial institutions.  COMPANIES   George Ball Steps Down When the big boys on Wall Street are suffering, a guy who tried to play with them but failed is truly in trouble. George L. Ball resigned as chairman and chief executive of Prudential-Bach Securities last Wednesday, felled by his loss of $308 million in less than nine years as the firm's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Ball tried to transform a humdrum brokerage firm into a glamorous, global investment bank, throwing around millions to hire star financiers. When the Prudential Insurance Company of America lost patience with his prodigal ways, he responded with what he called a ""light cruiser"" strategy, fighting only those competitive battles that he believed the firm could win. The losses continued, however, and Mr. Ball finally gave up his command. Carter Hawley Hale Goes Under  The real markdowns at Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. last week were on ""junk bonds"" and common stock; the largest department store chain on the West Coast, parent of the Broadway, Weinstocks and Emporium names, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Carter Hawley Hale story was another 1980's tale of efficient wealth transfer from bondholders, long-term investors and employees -- whose 45 percent stake in the company is now nearly worthless -- to lawyers, investment bankers and the usual short-term profiteers. In its efforts to fight off a takeover attempt led by the Limited Inc. chain in 1987, Carter Hawley Hale had taken on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Little was left, therefore, to improve the stores. Competition and a slack American economy did the rest. Auto Makers in Decline The Ford Motor Company has cut back, streamlined production and improved efficiency enough to almost rival the Japanese. But its fourth-quarter loss of $519 million confounded its mission to keep profits flowing even when a recession strikes. The General Motors Corporation lost $1.62 billion, giving the industry its second-worst quarter ever. Analysts were understanding, saying that auto companies can face no worse combination than a recession and higher energy prices. As James P. Womack, an auto industry authority at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, ""You can't take a 25 percent hit on volume and make much money in any business."" In Brief A Federal bankruptcy judge approved the sale of 67 Eastern Airlines takeoff and landing slots and five gates at Washington National Airport to Northwest Airlines for $35.5 million. The Justice Department blocked a bid by United Airlines for antitrust reasons. U S West Inc. agreed to pay $10 million, the largest antitrust fine ever, for violating the agreement that broke up the Bell System. INTERNATIONAL   Germany's High-Cost East One weekend last fall, a carnival on East Berlin's Alexanderplatz was so dreary that visitors had to ask to make sure it was taking place. On the Kurfurstendamm in West Berlin, meanwhile, every evening brought out raucous crowds lingering well past midnight. German officials said last Tuesday that giving eastern Germany much to celebrate will prove far more costly than they had thought. With a turnaround nowhere in sight, the Government approved $3 billion in emergency aid for cities and states. Economists say that rebuilding the eastern regions will cost the Government nearly $100 billion this year, more than $1 trillion over the decade. Traditional Eastern European export markets have evaporated, factories are closing and residents are leaving for the West. Germany's bind might well pinch relations with the United States. The cost of aiding the easterners makes Germans more reluctant to lower interest rates in support of the dollar or finance the war in the Middle East. Trouble With the Trade Deficit The trade deficit is heading in the right direction for the wrong reasons. The gap shrank to $6.3 billion in December, better than most economists had expected. Imports fell 7.9 percent, as the recession curbed America's appetite for foreign goods. But exports slipped also, by 2.1 percent, auguring ill for one of the economy's few healthy areas. ""We can't count on that sector as much in the months ahead,"" said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. As foreign economies slow, not even a weaker dollar is sufficient to stoke overseas demand."

Only two Senators and no Representatives voted no.   Twenty-seven of those lawmakers are still in Congress. And as they prepared for Saturday's vote on what was even more clearly the equivalent of a declaration of war, the resolution to authorize the use of military force in the Persian Gulf, the memories of that earlier vote weighed heavily on the minds of the seven senators and 20 representatives who served then and still serve now."

The flat statement that ""only a nonworking spouse in a 'lengthy marriage' is eligible for alimony"" is misleading. While alimony or maintenance, as it is now called, is less common than before, it is by no means limited to older full-time housewives. Younger women who have interrupted their careers for child-bearing can make a persuasive case for maintenance while they refresh their working skills, and even women who have remained in the work force but sacrificed advancement for the sake of motherhood have a strong legal argument for at least several years of maintenance -- and often get it.   Whether or not divorced women will be awarded or can negotiate such support depends on the norms of local courts and the skills of their attorneys, but they should not be put off by the unwarranted pessimism of the financial planners in your article.

In the skies over Iraq and Kuwait last week, their strategy was put to its first real test, and the preliminary results seem to be good news for the military and its weapons suppliers.   Although claims of military successes were difficult to verify, Pentagon officials said that Tomahawk cruise missiles equipped with complex guidance equipment rocketed into Iraq, identified pre-programmed targets and apparently scored a series of precise hits. Air Force F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft packed with ""black box"" technology like radar-sensing and jamming gear sped in to destroy radar installations at surface-to-air missile sites. F-15E strike-fighters, equipped with a new system called Lantirn that allows pilots to identify and track targets at night, kept the skies clear of those Iraqi combat aircraft that ventured forth. Officials described how a ""smart"" bomb dropped from a radar-evading F-117A Stealth fighter-bomber was guided literally through the front door of a missile warehouse. When threatened by an incoming Iraqi Scud missile, American forces in Saudi Arabia shot it out of the night sky with the new and stunningly sophisticated Patriot antimissile system."

In different cases, judges found that regulators overstepped their authority by reneging on promises to buyers of troubled savings and loans, by pushing healthy banks into insolvency, or by illegally trying to squeeze millions of dollars from owners of failed financial institutions.    Only a score of such lawsuits have been brought against the Government -- a minuscule number compared with the thousands of failed banks and savings and loans seized by regulators each year -- and many rulings are being appealed. But the trend has been against the Government, and some think it points to a disturbing pattern of regulators trying to reduce the cost of Federal bailouts at the expense of the law.      The validity of that interpretation, however, is still a matter of debate.   Rosemary Stewart, a lawyer with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Washington and former director of enforcement for the Office of Thrift Supervision, thinks the courts have recognized that regulators ""are going too far.""   ""In a vengence mentality after the savings and loan crisis,"" she said, ""the Government is trying to get everything it possibly can.""    But Alfred J. T. Byrne, general counsel of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, feels the court decisions ""reflect either a misunderstanding or a misapplication of the new law, or both.""    ""We do not draw any conclusion that there is a tide flowing against the Government agencies,"" he said.    No one contests the power of regulators to seize assets of insolvent banks and savings and loans in order to protect depositors' money. But several cases turn on interpretations of the savings and loan industry bailout legislation enacted by Congress in August 1989.    Two cases test the retroactive application of that law. They involve the seizure by regulators in March 1989 of several healthy Texas banks after their parent banks, MBank in Dallas and the Texas American Bank in Fort Worth, became insolvent.   Regulators pushed more than a dozen healthy subsidiary banks of the two companies into insolvency by failing to fully repay loans that the subsidiary banks made to the parents. Two courts have said that the subsidiaries are owed full payment under then-prevailing banking laws, but the Government is appealing on the ground that the 1989 bailout law permited only partial repayment.    The F.D.I.C. has since lobbied successfully to have the 1989 bailout law permit unequal payments to creditors of failed banks.    In another group of cases, regulators' attempts to abrogate concessions given to entice investors to buy failing savings and loans have been challenged. Eight of these cases have gone against the Government, four have gone in its favor and, in two others, the court said it had no jurisdiction.    The Government has lost three other cases that involved attempts by regulators to collect money from owners of failed savings and loans by forcing them to put up new capital after institutions were declared insolvent.    The 1989 bailout law is also being questioned in a group of cases involving concessions given by regulators to buyers of troubled savings and loans before the law's enactment. Regulators contend that the new law permits them to disregard these concessions, which are generally forbearances allowing newly acquired savings and loans to operate with lower capital requirements or more liberal lending policies than permitted by law.    One of the best known in this group of cases involves Far West Federal Bank, a Portland, Ore., savings and loan that regulators sold to investors in 1987. In return for investing some $27 million of capital, the Government gave the new investors 10 years to meet capital requirements and approved a liberal lending policy.    But with the 1989 bailout law, regulators told Far West that it was out of compliance with the law and that its owners faced daily fines of up to $1 million. Far West quickly complied, but as a result began losing money; officers and depositors fled and its balance sheet shrank.   Far West's owners now say the Government can take the institution back -- they just want their $27 million returned, along with $100 million in damages. United States District Judge Owen M. Panner agreed, ruling that regulators violated Fifth Amendment guarantees against illegal seizure of property and that their action was ""economic suicide"" for Far West."" Damages have yet to be set.     A final batch of rulings against the Government involves attempts by regulators to collect money by enforcing capital requirements after a savings and loan failed. One leading case involves a Texas company named Tetco, which in 1983 bought a Texas savings and loan in San Antonio called the Bexar Savings Association. To get deposit insurance, Tetco agreed to certain capital levels and to add more when necessary. Over time, Tetco sunk some $25 million into Bexar.    Bexar, however, suffered losses and was declared insolvent and seized by regulators in February 1989, wiping out Tetco's investment. The Government then sued Tetco for $558 million -- the amount needed for Bexar to meet its capital requirements if it were still alive. But United States District Judge Lucius D. Bunton in San Antonio dismissed the Government's claim, as did judges in two similar cases elsewhere.   "

Peru and the International Monetary Fund reached agreement in December on basic economic goals. The central bank governor, Jorge Chavez, said shortly afterward that nine countries, led by the United States, were willing to help bridge the fiscal gap.   The assistance would enable Peru to bridge a 1991 balance of payments gap and clear $2.15 billion in arrears to the I.M.F., the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank."

The report follows similar recent data on gross national product, incomes, unemployment insurance claims and orders for durable goods, all of which were less negative than many had feared. It tended to support the widely held belief that the recession would be shorter and milder than the 11-month, 2.2 percent average decline posted by the other eight postwar contractions.

But private economists cautioned that even a fully arrested downturn does not imply prompt economic revival.

But Mr. Langenberg, the fourth generation in his family to head the Langenberg Hat Company of Washington, Mo., says that the headwear business is actually enjoying a comeback. No one in the industry expects formal felt hats to recapture the universal popularity they enjoyed before World War II. But most Americans own many more caps and leisure hats than they realize and seem eager to accumulate more.    The Headwear Institute of America, a New York-based group, estimates that sales have been growing at 5 percent to 10 percent for the past few years. More precise statistics are hard to come by because all the companies are small, most of them secretive and none publicly traded. Many manufacturers say that despite the recession, sales are still growing, driven by everything from changing fashions to the awareness that sunburn can contribute to skin cancer. Hat and cap makers hope that they will scarcely feel the recession because, for every customer who suddenly feels too poor to buy, others decide that they can economize by purchasing a hat instead of a complete outfit."

Military and political analysts inside and outside the Bush Administration agree that the rebellion by the Kurds, non-Arabs who make up about 20 percent of Iraq's population, could be an important factor in weakening the Hussein Government. But no Kurdish revolt has ever brought down an Iraqi government since the nation gained independence from Britain in 1932, although an inability to quash rebellions contributed to the overthrow of a number of governments before the Baath Party came to power in 1968."

In the piece, Salim Lone, a Kenyan, argues that after the current American engagement in the Persian Gulf is over, the industrialized Western countries must help Africa cope with its economic problems by offering massive ""debt relief and easier terms for receiving aid."" Furthermore, Mr. Lone advises the West not to spend more of its expertise and resources on Eastern Europe where the collapse of Communism paved the way for private investment.   With all due respect, I strongly disagree on both accounts. First, while Africa was busy getting close to $230 billion in loans and credit in the past 30 years, which marked the rise of the new African states from the era of European colonialism, the Eastern European countries that were forced into the Warsaw Pact by the Red Army weren't getting any sort of significant assistance from the West. ""In the 1980's,"" writes Jennifer Whitaker in her book ""How Can Africa Survive,"" ""Africans, who are about 12 percent of the developing world's population, were receiving about 22 percent of the total aid and the share per person was higher than anywhere else in the third world.""   Now that there has been democratic change in Eastern European nations, it is in the interest of the West that massive assistance, both private and public, be given to them so they can develop a free market economy with a stable middle class.   Africans, like yesteryear's East Europeans, need to get rid of their corrupted dictators who more often than not run the state for the benefit of one man, his family and his tribe. The West should not fall for the eloquent speeches delivered by Africa's 40-plus dictators who all of a sudden celebrate the virtue of free-market capitalism and the failure of centrally planned economic systems. They hadn't read Karl Marx's ""Das Kapital"" when they were with the Soviets and their new conversion to the market is not based on an understanding of Adam Smith's ""Wealth of Nations."" They say whatever the donor countries with the most funds wish to hear.   Unless Africa experiences an Easternn European-style revolution, no amount of debt relief and aid will be enough to solve its economic misery. ABDUL RAHMAN ABDI Greenbelt, Md., Feb. 10"

He refused to respond to questions but said he was taking the time necessary to consider ""when a next stage might begin."" AND THE RAIDS GO ON    In the already fierce assault on Iraqi targets, U.S., British and French warplanes bombed bridges, roads and front-line units in their dug-in positions. The battered port city of Basra, Iraq's second largest, also came under heavy bombardment, having been designated a military objective. And Iraq called up 17-year-olds for the first time, a possible indication of serious troop losses. A REMINDER FROM ISRAEL   Defense Minister Moshe Arens paid a hasty visit to the White House to tell President Bush that Israel had suffered greatly from Iraqi rockets and that its patience was wearing thin. His call seemed to reinforce warnings that Israel might strike, although it remained unclear what its weapons could do beyond what the U.S.-led air assault on Iraq, now in its 27th day, is doing already. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES    Troops: Yesterday's Pentagon briefer put the cumulative total of U.S. combat losses at 60: 12 killed in action, 12 wounded, 28 missing and 8 P.O.W.'s.    Aircraft: The Pentagon said ""there were zero U.S. aircraft lost,"" leaving the combat total at 18. IRAQI FORCES    Troops: More defections pushed the number of P.O.W.'s past 1,000 yesterday. No meaningful data on military casualties are available beyond an unconfirmed report in an Egyptian weekly that Iraq confidentially informed friendly Arab countries that 15,000 soldiers had died thus far. As for civilians killed, a senior Iraqi official said yesterday that ""thousands"" had been killed or wounded in air raids, far more than the 650 dead and 750 wounded officially reported earlier. And former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, fresh from a visit to Baghdad, said the head of the Iraqi Red Crescent estimated the death toll at between 6,000 and 7,000 civilians. The White House yesterday rejected these high figures and talk of peace feelers as a ""propaganda and P.R. battle""    Aircraft: The U.S. military in Riyadh said Iraq had lost about 40 percent of its prewar total of about 600 military aircraft, and the Pentagon yesterday broke that down as 39 shot down, 142 grounded with their crews in Iran for the duration, and the rest caught on the ground."

But evidence is accumulating that the recession has taken on a life of its own and will probably endure.    The phenomenon that links the gulf crisis and the economy, in the minds of many economists, is public confidence, which deteriorated sharply after the invasion on Aug. 2. Those who measure public confidence -- the Conference Board and the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center -- at first said the gulf crisis had precipitated the deterioration, in part because of rising oil prices. Now they argue that other factors are unnerving Americans, inhibiting the spending that invigorates the economy."

Gannett, which publishes USA Today among its 82 daily newspapers, said that the 1989 fourth quarter had 14 weeks compared with 13 weeks in 1990. It said the 1989 fiscal year had 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in 1990.   In a statement, John J.

Supplies for Six Months     Tank and artillery losses are in the ""low hundreds,"" the officials said, and up to six months' worth of supplies have been salted away in thousands of small depots that cannot be targeted by allied bombers."

A 30-year old Saudi pilot in an American-made F-15 shot down a pair of French-built Iraqi Mirage fighters over the Persian Gulf. A force of Marines, described as the largest amphibious group since the Korean War, practiced landings. DANGEROUS BRITISH MISSIONS The most dangerous missions of the war are being carried out by British pilots, most in their 20's, who fly into Iraq a few hundred feet above the ground to drop cluster bombs on well-protected Iraqi airfields. So far, 10 of the Tornado bomber airmen have been killed or are missing. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: Fourteen Americans and 12 allied airmen are listed as missing in action. Aircraft: A 15th American plane, an Air Force F-16, was lost, but its pilot was picked up by a Navy helicopter. The allied command has reported 21 warplanes lost, 17 of them in combat. IRAQI FORCES Troops: Iraq has reported 39 military deaths and nearly 100 civilian deaths. The allies say 29 more Iraqis were taken prisoner on the island of Qura off the Kuwaiti coast. Aircraft: The American command reported that the allies had shot down 19 enemy planes and destroyed 41 on the ground. A Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday's announcement of 19 planes shot down was an overcount by two. A Saudi pilot shot down two Iraqis yesterday so the count was placed at 19."

The canister was conceived by Chuck Ellis, director of marketing at Boston's Grill 23 and Bar. Mr. Ellis said he had not been able to preserve wine for more than three weeks. As a result, he said, it was virtually impossible to sell expensive wines by the glass because the remaining wine might not be consumed before its taste and bouquet degraded. Similarly, wine collectors cannot sample a vintage and return the bottle to their collection.   The new device allows a person to pour wine without removing the cork or letting air into the bottle. It consists of a canister filled with a special gas, designed to take the place of liquid leaving the bottle. The gas consists of argon, which does not mix with anything, and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor that matches the natural percentages in wine.   Protruding from the center of the canister is a hollow tube with a screw-tip that penetrates the cork. By pulling a handle on the canister's side, Mr. Ellis said, the hollow tip opens up and wine can pour through it. At the same time, he said, the aerosol canister pushes the replacement gas into the bottle through a second tube. As a result, outside air has no way of getting into the container. Mr. Ellis said the device made it possible to preserve a wine indefinitely.   Mr. Ellis, Michael Osean, and Nori Hirako received patent 4,984,711."

The two allies told Moscow separately that they wanted Baghdad to agree to a deadline of a few days for its unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, the diplomats said. This could force Iraq to abandon tanks, artillery and other arms taken into Kuwait after the Aug. 2 invasion. Baghdad has yet to respond to Moscow's plan, the details of which have not been disclosed. 12 Resolutions     Diplomats say the United States wants Iraq to be required to leave the tanks and heavy armaments behind, while Britain takes the view that obliging it to do so as a condition of a cease-fire would exceed the terms of the Security Council mandate.

This would bring the daily tally of American losses to 14 killed in action, 26 airmen missing in action and 8 confirmed as prisoners of war. The U.S. Central Command in Riyadh did not provide an overall count. A Saudi spokesman said 18 Saudi soldiers were killed in the fighting at Khafji last week, 29 were wounded and 4 were missing. A Qatari spokesman said he had no casualties to report. Aircraft: In addition to the B-52 bomber lost on its way back to base, an AH-1 Cobra with two aboard and a UH-1 helicopter carrying four crashed over Saudi Arabia. But the U.S. Central Command's briefer in Riyadh did not add them to the daily cumulative count of aircraft losses because, he said, they were believed to be ""non-combat-related."" The command said combat losses as such stood at 15 American and 7 other coalition aircraft, for a total of 22. IRAQI FORCES Troops: The number of Iraqi prisoners grew to ""some 800,"" according to the United States command. No reliable data on other or military or civilian losses were available. Aircraft: The Riyadh command's count of aircraft destroyed while parked or bunkered rose sharply to at least 99 and as many as 140, since some bunkers sheltered more than one. The number of aircraft shot down stood at 27, and 89 aircraft and crews remained sequestered in Iran."

We should be explicit about the tension between journalism and economics. Cutbacks are reducing the ability of newspapers to deliver a quality news product. The deeper and more protracted the cuts, the more readers will be lost. A management decision to maintain editorial quality will be particularly painful when newspapers have a negative cash flow.   Newspapers are hypercyclical: they lose sales more quickly than the average industry when the economy softens, and they rebound more rapidly in a period of recovery. When the recovery comes, the 15 percent margins will return. Then the test for newspapers will be whether they invest in essential innovation.   It is easy to forget the decades of family ownership when many daily newspapers kept 40 cents or 50 cents of each sales dollar before taxes. This attracted chain buyers who have since watched the extraordinary margins evaporate because of the debt used to buy the papers, the changing needs of audiences and advertisers and the success of new competitors.

Two American fighter-bombers, attacking entrenched positions of Iraq's Republican Guard, were shot down by surface-to-air missiles. BUSH'S COMMENTS ON HUSSEIN President Bush's call for the Iraqi military to overthrow Saddam Hussein reflects the extent to which Mr. Hussein's downfall is a key consideration in the Administration's Persian Gulf strategy. Mr. Bush was prompted to issue the call after watching televised scenes of jubilation in Baghdad at the possibility of peace, concluding that the Iraqi people were ripe for such an appeal.  War Losses Allied Forces  Troops: Yesterday, one airman died in a non-combat mission and two were reported missing in Kuwait. No new totals were released yesterday by the U.S. Central Command, but the latest previous toll of American was 62, including 14 killed, 12 wounded, 28 missing and eight confirmed prisoners of war.  Aircraft: Two American A-10 aircraft were shot down yesterday, the U.S. Central command in Riyadh reported.

Based on other comments made by Mr. Totten, I assume the Lotus Development Corporation was one of the companies to which he was referring.   Let me set the record straight. After almost three years of painstaking development work to insure the product met specific requirements of Japanese users, Lotus introduced 1-2-3/J in 1986. Within a month, it was the best-selling software package in Japan. According to Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun, a daily business newspaper in Japan, 1-2-3/J has been the best-selling spreadsheet in Japan since its introduction. The product has won numerous awards, including being the first non-Japanese product to win the prestigious Nikkei Award for creative excellence.   Lotus has 120 employees in Japan, all but one of whom is Japanese, and it's likely Japan will be the company's second-largest market in 1991, trailing only the United States.   For someone who claims to have adopted the Japanese culture, Mr. Totten's inaccurate and specious comments are uncharacteristic of Japanese business etiquette.

The change could substantially affect rates for many kinds of insurance, the prices of insurance stocks and the economy in the Northeast, where the largest insurance companies are based.    Stung by losses or shrinking profits in many of their businesses, the insurers are sharply cutting back on or abandoning entire areas of insurance, selling unrelated businesses, closing offices and laying off workers."

Four months later, the official, Keith Spicer, has more than lived up to his billing as a quirky fellow who says what many Canadian public figures may think but hesitate to say in this country, where public discourse generally remains within well-circumscribed proprieties."

With no new agreement, the shows would be available to NBC's rivals."

Now Citicorp, desperate for capital, is paying such rates.   The $590 million capital infusion that Citicorp obtained last week from a Saudi prince came at a heavy cost. It may have proved that it can raise capital, but the 11 percent rate on preferred stock it issued for the money is equivalent to a pretax rate of 15 percent for a corporate investor. And Citicorp may go on paying that rate long after the current crisis of confidence has passed. Not before 1996 can the company force Prince al-Waleed bin Talal to convert the preferred to common, at $16 per share. Any profits on conversion will come on top of the assured 11 percent return."

Trouble In San Diego,"  The Great American Bank, a financially troubled savings and loan association in San Diego, said today that it was at risk of being seized by the Government because it is violating its Federally approved plan of operation.    The institution said it expected to set aside money to cover loan and real estate losses in the quarter that ended on Dec. 31 that would exceed by $100 million the loss provisions projected in its capital plan. Falling out of compliance with the capital plan violates an order from the Office of Thrift Supervision and could result in the institition's seizure, Great American said.    Robert L. Kemper, Great American's chairman, said it was uncertain what actions the regulatory agency would take.    Last November the Government approved a sweeping recovery plan for Great American that included the sale of its branches in California to Wells Fargo Bank.    It is not clear what effect any action will have on the sale agreement with Wells Fargo."

The placement, by a specially created company called Fifth Avenue Capital Trust, was done through underwriters led by Goldman Sachs International.   The financing was done to pay down bridge loans taken out in the acquisition of Saks by Investcorp, an international investor group, according to a Saks official.   One group of notes placed was a $200 million issue of extendible, adjustable notes paying the three-month London interbank offered rate, Libor, plus 75 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.    These notes can be extended by the issuer for two years beginning December 1995 upon payment of 2 percent of the principal amount.    Also placed was a $25 million note issue paying the three-month London interbank rate plus 45 basis points, and $275 million of variable-rate notes paying 75 basis points over the interbank rate, which can be convertible on any interest payment date into floating-rate notes."

Historically, when consumer confidence rises, funds weighted down with consumer ""stables"" -- companies that make drugs, cigarettes and other products with steady consumer demand -- lag. By contrast, those holding ""cyclicals"" -- companies that make cars, appliances and other items that consumers can postpone buying -- do well."

Joseph D. Hawkins was accused of racketeering and theft in connection with the 1986 collapse of the Continental Bankers Life Insurance Company of the South.   His lawyer, Mark A. Weitz, and Texas insurance regulators involved in the Federal lawsuit confirmed on Tuesday that a settlement had been reached but refused to disclose details.   Mr. Hawkins, who resigned as state insurance commissioner in 1977, headed a group that bought Continental Bankers, chartered in Tennessee, in 1980 and sold it two years later. State investigators contend that during his ownership and for years afterward, Mr. Hawkins participated in a conspiracy to defraud Continental Bankers' policyholders.   In the civil suit filed in 1988 by Texas and Tennessee, Mr. Hawkins was accused with eight others of racketeering, conspiracy and fraud in the purported looting of Continental Bankers."

Some critics of the system say that only a written constitution and bill of rights can produce the kind of far-reaching change necessary to preclude similar miscarriages of justice in the future. In the current two-decade-old struggle with the I.R.A., they say, successive British Governments have limited the rights of defendants in terrorist cases and left the police with extensive powers that can easily be abused."

As they made the announcement, the Baghdad radio said Iraqi troops had captured two American servicemen in the southern city of Basra, and Red Cross officials said later in the day that the two men had been turned over to its officials in Baghdad. The Pentagon has so far been unable to clear up confusion about the two, who were identified by an Iraqi Government spokesman on the Baghdad Radio as First Lieut. Gavin Rice and Pvt. Allen Jeoffrey Allen, both of the Army's VII Corps."

The complicating factor in this case is timing. The recommendations come hot on the heels of the collapse of the savings and loan industry, a collapse that some wrongly insist is a foreshadowing of what's in store for banking.    While I don't mean to minimize the serious problems facing commercial banks, I contend that the prophets of doom are way off the mark when they suggest banks are about to go the way of the savings and loans. Make no mistake, there will be casualties. Many well-known names might not survive as we know them today. But it won't be the industry Armageddon some are predicting."

Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had been meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. The moment Mr. Tagler heard Mr. Baker say on television, ""Regrettably . . . ,"" the trader was on the phone to the commodity pit. Buy orders had pushed the price to $31 -- the quickest rise he had ever seen. Economists are somewhat more stable in their sentiments, occasionally holding them for a whole week. Their consensus by the weekend was that if the United States fights and wins quickly and tidily, oil prices would fall and the economy would benefit. ""I understand the mood swings, but people are exaggerating,"" said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns. ""There is a worldwide glut of oil against a backdrop of weak demand."" But if there is a protracted war, many economists say, the budget deficit would widen, and oil prices and interest rates would rise. ""The uncertainty will have a debilitating effect,"" said Richard B. Berner, a Salomon Brothers economist. ""People will hold back from making long-term commitments."" Even a last-minute settlement will not be enough to overcome recession, economists say, since growth was slowing before Iraqi troops set foot in Kuwait. Again, Sweat Doesn't Pay  Will the returns on labor rebound and surpass the returns on wealth in the 1990's? From 1984 to 1988, the wealthiest gained in net worth, while everyone else stagnated, the Census Bureau reported last week. The less affluent depend mostly on their wages, which in the 1980's barely kept pace with inflation. Stocks and bonds, meanwhile, enjoyed strong returns. Lacy H. Hunt, chief United States economist for the Hongkong Bank Group, doubts that investments will continue soaring. But wages will rise as labor supplies tighten, he says. ""The headlines of one decade go into the trash bin of the new decade,"" he said. For investors, ""The decade hasn't started off very well, has it?"" Wholesale Comfort  The wholesale inflation news for December was comforting at every stop in the production chain. For finished goods, prices fell six-tenths of 1 percent overall; they only rose three-tenths of a point excluding food and energy. Prices for intermediate and crude goods, earlier in the production process, also fell. Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley said the report leaves the Federal Reserve plenty of room to stoke the economy. ""The fundamentals are as constructive for inflation as they have been at any point in the onset of the last few recessions,"" he said. The annual gain, 5.6 percent, was the highest since 1981, but a mild 3.5 percent core rate. An Uptown Jazz Market  Where sopranos now screech, saxaphones will squeal and coo.

But judging by what works best at Lincoln Center, Mr. Gibson might better raise his top ticket prices to $115, require black tie on opening nights and drag dozens of shield-bearing supernumeraries on stage. Banking Forecast: Rain  At times last week, L. William Seidman's spirits improved to merely gloomy. Otherwise, he was downright dismal. On Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned the Senate Banking Committee that more major bank failures were likely if the recession persists past mid-year. On Friday, he landed in Boston, like a governor visiting a hurricane disaster zone, to say that the region needs more widely available bank credit to free itself from a recession. ""I don't think there's probably a bad loan being made in New England at this time,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, there aren't many others either."" INTERNATIONAL   A Payoff for Turkey?  One possible winner in the Middle East crisis: Turkey, which right after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait cut off Iraqi oil pipelines and made military bases available to counter Iraq. Turkey hopes the United States and its allies will offer more help in its continuing disputes with Greece. And Turkey can look forward to closer economic ties with Europe's wealthier nations, said Robert G. Neumann, director of Middle East programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Turkey needs aid to improve its infrastructure -- the phone lines are too feeble to carry faxes abroad, for example -- if it hopes to capitalize on its low labor costs. Although the European Community is considering several applications for admission, Mr. Neumann said, ""Turkey may very well move up in the line."" With luck, Turkey might prove that it can approach the prosperity of the West.   Oil Importers Prepare for War  The International Energy Agency, representing 21 oil-importing nations, agreed on Friday to release 2 million barrels a day from reserves in case of war in the Middle East. The United States, the largest oil importer, cut petroleum consumption 2.1 percent in 1990, the first drop in seven years. Domestic oil production fell to the lowest level since 1961.

The lesson is that a modern-day bank run is containable because of Federal deposit insurance. The situation is far different from Depression-era runs that wiped out the life savings of millions.  [ Page 1. ]  The press has played an important role in recent months in shaping public confidence in many banks and attitudes toward the banking industry.  [ 33. ]   A majority of forecasters insist that the recession will end by August, basing their optimism on the behavior of past recessions and big recent rises in stock prices. By their own admission, however, they are playing down troubling features of this recession that could prove them wrong.  [ 29. ]   A new law requires drug companies to give Medicaid the same deep discounts they give other big customers. But instead of reducing Medicaid drug prices, many companies are raising the prices that other big customers must pay. Health-care experts say these added costs may soon trickle down to consumers in the form of higher medical costs, and ultimately, insurance premiums.  [ 1. ]   The problems of domestic auto makers are being aggravated by a decline in the sales of some of its most profitable products: full-size pickup trucks and vans. Sales of light trucks, which include pickup trucks, vans and sports-utility vehicles, declined 7 percent in the fourth quarter, while car sales rose 1 percent.  [ 29. ]   Some small companies that thought they were recession-resistant a finding they are not. Not only are consumers holding back on new purchases, but goods and services bought are frequently paid for more slowly.  [ 29. ]   A California company is proposing what may be the ultimate wilderness experience for those who think they are roughing it when they peer at mountains and canyons through the windshield of a car: viewing a magnificent film about Zion National Park on a giant wrap-around movie screen, without ever having to set foot in the park.  [ 1. ]   The Atlanta metropolitan area is expected to lose jobs this year for the first time since 1974. The demise of Eastern Airlines may have struck the final blow to the optimism of the city, the engine that drives Georgia's economy.  [ 10. ]   Cattle ranchers say they face bigger challenges than the extreme weather of places like Wyoming, the constant hard work and even weak beef prices. What bothers some of them the most, they say, are growing attacks on their products from the medical community and environmentalists.  [ 32. ]  The Media Business    Young & Rubicam is trying to regain the edge it held in the creative revolution of the 1960's. To that end, the agency has hired an outsider to head its New York creative department, which suffers from an image of making lackluster ads.  [ 29. ]   NBC is in the middle of a high-stakes game of programming poker as it tries to extend the lives of aging hit comedies. Even winning the game will cost NBC a potful of money; the producers of ""Cheers,"" for example, are reportedly seeking $4 million an episode. But losing could end NBC's ratings dominance and even send the network into third place. Bill Carter: Television.  [ 34. ]   The gulf war is cutting into the publicity that new books receive. Some authors have had book tours curtailed or canceled. Others are finding it increasingly difficult to get television interviews. As a result, sales of some books are likely to fall. And the publication of at least one travel book has been delayed.  [ 34. ]   The BBC World Service has expanded its Arabic-language broadcasts to the Middle East. The Arabic Service provides news to 10 million listeners, the BBC estimates.  [ 34. ]  International    Several Soviet economists say the Soviet Union's transition to a market economy remains irreversible, even if recent developments have slowed the process, because the old centrally planned system has been too dismantled and discredited to be rebuilt.

Many hoped that last year's unification of Germany would improve their lives. But now, they say, they realize that the worst is yet to come.   Giant power plants that ring the town will soon start laying off thousands of workers. The local textile combine, no longer supported by Government subisidies, is likely to shut down. Free health clinics and day-care centers have been closed, and rents will soon be raised to at least five times their current levels.  Once-Proud Cities Falter     German unification has plunged people in the eastern part of the country into a state of trauma. The complaints heard in Cottbus, with some local variations, echo from the Baltic port of Rostock, where tens of thousands of workers marched recently to protest the planned closing of local shipyards, to the once-proud cities of Leipzig and Dresden, where local governments are near bankruptcy."

The underlying concept is an important one in the sociology of knowledge: that truth varies with time, place and vested interests, as well as with technological limits. Since it is hard to show the curved surface of the earth on a flat plane, there are likely to be some distortions. Cartographers have choices.   According to German historian Arno Peters, they have chosen not to focus on prettier shapes, but to underestimate the areas of third world countries. The new world map, produced with the support of the United Nations Development Program, deserves at least some consideration.

Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, told a meeting of the 108-nation Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the talks, that it was possible to proceed.     But GATT officials said neither the United States nor the 12-nation European Community would be ready to start discussing substantive questions before June.   Mr. Dunkel said he had not proposed a date for ending the talks because it could take ""two or three months"" for major nations to agree on one.   The so-called Uruguay Round of trade talks, which began in Uruguay in 1986, fell apart in Brussels last December. Farm exporting nations, led by the United States, clashed bitterly with the European Community on cutting farm subsidies.   The United States said then that it would not return to the talks until Europe changed its position on resisting large cuts in the subsidies. That happened last week, when the community unexpectedly accepted Washington's view on possible ways to resolve the problem."

Now, for more and more of the relatively small numbers of university-educated women like 27-year-old Kay Makuku, marriage is a custom to be avoided.    Miss Makuku, a post-graduate student in French at Nairobi University and a former schoolteacher, sees herself 10 years from now as a single parent, with a male companion but not a husband. It is a choice that many of her female friends over 30, from television producers to professors, have already made.   Other modern-thinking women in urban Africa are delaying marriage. Of the 16 women who graduated from the law faculty at the university here in 1980, more than half remain single.   ""Many, many women are not committing themselves to men,"" said Rosemary Kaduru, a lawyer from the 1980 class. Shift in Attitudes     Such unorthodox attitudes toward marriage are a revolutionary departure for African women, far more dramatic for them than for their American and European counterparts, who were crystalizing similar thoughts two decades ago. And simply put, the disdain toward marriage can be summed up in two words: African men.   ""At least our African grandfathers looked after their women,"" said Miss Makuku, relaxing in her apartment, equipped with a stereo and television. ""But now the average man might contribute to the rent but use the rest for mistresses and beer. They drink a lot. I can't imagine anyone beating me up but I talk to some women my age or older and they don't see anything wrong with it.""   So far, Africa has produced few standout, publicly known feminists, a word barely in the lexicon. In some countries, like Zimbabwe and Uganda, women appointed to senior positions in government have found themselves free to express the need for an improved status for women.   But those women tread a difficult path. Male chauvinism is ingrained and indeed, codified, in much of African culture. For example, Kenya is one of the few African countries to have a law, passed in 1981, that allows women to inherit and own property, said Mrs. Kaduru, one of the minority of women in her law class to marry. But, she said, so few women knew about the law that many persisted in their beliefs that they did not have property and inheritance rights. Husbands' Restrictions     In a region where statistics are often hard to come by, little hard data exists to document the rebellion against marriage by Africa's young, educated women, whose abilities to articulate their expectations far outweigh their small numbers. The Kenyan Government's Women's Bureau estimates that in 1984, 24 percent of 20- to 24-year-old women had never married; five years later the percentage had risen to 32 percent. Another indicator stands out. The number of university-educated women is increasing. At Nairobi University, a third of the students are women; in some faculties, like law, half the students are women.   And anecdotal evidence abounds among professional women who have been briefly married but find they cannot tolerate the restrictions put on them by their husbands.   ""Men are ready to be modern outside their homes,"" said Martha Njoka, a 33-year-old criminal lawyer with a flourishing practice in Nairobi. ""You will find a man so liberal in all his relations except at home. Many will profess the idea but will not treat you as an equal partner. Once you are a Mrs., the husband will treat you as though you are bound to him and the home.""   Miss Njoka's live-in relationship with a doctor ended soon after they became married. He could not endure her going out on her own with friends or business associates or to a diplomatic reception, as she did recently. But he was free to go out with his friends, she said. 'I Will Keep My Career'     She does not plan to marry again.    Of course not all educated women in their 20's and 30's are rejecting marriage. Janet Kabeberi Macharia, a 29-year-old lecturer in law who specializes in the law of reproductive rights at the University of Nairobi, said she believed in family and marriage.   ""But I have decided to go into it at my own pace, at my own time,"" said Mrs. Macharia, who married her husband, a 30-year-old business consultant, last year. ""I will keep my career and try to be a mother and wife."" She has postponed having children until ""we get to know each other a bit more.""   And, she said, her husband is unusual. Men Seen as Slow to Adapt     ""We do go out a lot together,"" she said. ""It pains a lot of people. 'Why should you be with her?' they say to him. The perception is that it is because I'm educated and sit on him.""   Some educated African men acknowledge that they have been slow to adapt to the idea of more independence for African women.   ""We have been brought up to be like our fathers,"" said a Nairobi lawyer, who asked not to be identified. ""When I came out of university, it was hard for me to adjust to the idea of women having a life of their own, a job of their own.""   Gitobu Imanyara, editor of the Nairobi Law Monthly, said most African men expect to keep a mistress or two and for their wife to stay at home when they go out. Men have believed that their obligations end with provision of money for food and school fees.   An Inferiority Complex?     ""There is an inferiority complex among these men that an educated woman who can do what he can do is a threat,"" said Mr. Imanyara, who was interviewed before he was arrested on Friday by the Kenyan authorities. Mr. Imanyara's law magazine had published the manifesto of a new opposition party in defiance of the country's one-party state.   The question of relations between the sexes in Africa is something that Miss Makuku, an outgoing woman who plays tennis and squash, has thought about not only in relation to her life but in her studies. She is pursuing the subject in her postgraduate thesis about the portrayal of male characters in the literature of two female Senegalese writers.   Miss Makuku, whose experience has been broadened by two trips to Europe on scholarships to study French, has had several boyfriends.    To remain unmarried, Miss Makaku says, African women must have economic independence and a decent standard of living, a goal that the vast majority of them cannot achieve. But women's organizations, including the Kenyan Women's Lawyers Association, that are dedicated to helping women improve their status have developed in Kenya.    Miss Makaku manages to support herself on her limited income. Through the teacher's credit union, she borrowed for the luxuries of her life: a late-model television, tape deck, refrigerator, stove and a few pieces of simple but attractive furniture.   But Miss Makuku said it would be difficult to have children without the financial support of a man.    Most of her successful single friends had decided by the age of 35 to have children without getting married, she said. There were several avenues. The first was to have a child by a younger man, which many women find acceptable because a younger man is less likely to boss them around, Miss Makuku said. The second was to have a child by a married man.   ""Some choose to become mistresses,"" said Miss Makuku. ""It is a paradox because they have rejected African men"" for marriage because of their mistresses.  "

Not so anymore. Low pressure in older fields, especially in the United States, has made the gusher a thing of the past. Now, oil is much more likely to seep from small scattered reservoirs through tiny root-like cracks in porous rock. Find the cracks, find the oil. To do that, Atlas Wireline Services in Houston, a joint venture of Litton Industries Inc. and Dresser Industries Inc., has designed a circumferential borehead imaging device to produce sharp electronic images of the inside of the well hole at depths up to 30,000 feet and temperatures up to 350 degrees Farenheit.   The device can be attached to a cable and dropped to the bottom of the hole or, in holes that have horizontal turns, pushed along with sections of drilling pipe. As the device is slowly pulled to the surface, three rotating transducers emit a series of sharp, high-frequency acoustical shocks. The sounds bounce off the rocks, return to the transducers and then are sent to a computer and tape recorder at the surface of the well. Rocks of different porosity cause the sounds to return at different rates. These differences can be measured and converted into an image of the inside of the well that can show features as small as 1/ 100 of an inch, the size of the cracks that convey oil. Once isolated, the oil find can be tapped."

Gasoline and crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels since shortly before Iraq marched into Kuwait. An American Automobile Association survey released last week said that gasoline had declined to $1.135 a gallon, about the same price as before the war but for a 5-cent-a-gallon Federal tax increase. Oil, driven down by peace proposals, closed on Friday at $17.91 a barrel, less than half its October peak. But don't start celebrating just yet. Even some of those analysts who expect crude oil to stay low expect gasoline costs to rise. Iraqi and Kuwaiti refineries have been ruined in the war; the Iraqis were apparently torching Kuwaiti facilities at the end of the week. Even the Saudis have to import fuel to supply the military, and gasoline demand will rise more rapidly once the American economy revives. ""There will be ample crude for refiners, but not adequate refining capacity for consumers,"" said Alfred O. Munk, a consultant and the former foreign affairs manager for the Amoco Corporation. ""Crude,"" he pointed out, ""is not what you consume."" The Inflation Numbers Game A recession that was supposed to extinguish inflation has still left the pilot light burning. Consumer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January, eight-tenths without food and energy. Economists, who can no more take a figure at face value than Ella Fitzgerald can leave a melody unadorned, went to work explaining away the news. Look at higher liquor taxes, increased auto costs, rising apparel prices, other one-time events, they said. But a few saw underlying pressures, especially the 6 percent annual-rate increase in service costs, which account for about half of the inflation index. In dousing inflation, said William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, ""a short, shallow recession isn't going to give you much benefit."" Greenspan Confused? Let nobody out-worry Alan Greenspan about the Persian Gulf war and the credit crunch. In addressing two Congressional committees last week, he rehearsed his forecast of a mild recession, but then added more fine print than your typical car-rental agreement. Some of those clauses concerned the war, but most troubling, he said, was the Fed's inability to prompt banks to resume lending to their creditworthy customers. If Mr. Greenspan usually appears as a determined general unwilling to reveal his battle plans, last week he all but confessed to confusion. He seemed uncertain about whether to maintain or lower interest rates, adding that others at the Fed are divided. Some of his colleagues counsel patience, anticipating a rebound; others have a darker outlook than his. Here Comes Unicode The United Nations' near-unanimity on Kuwait was unusual, but the computer industry's agreement to use a common digital code is truly extraordinary. The usually fractious companies, including International Business Machines, Apple, Sun and Microsoft, hope for Unicode to become a global standard representing letters and characters in every language. Companies could then more readily write software to work in a variety of languages, and international computer communications would flow more smoothly. ""It's a lot more meaningful than Esperanto, because we're dealing with computers, not people"" said Esther Dyson, publisher of the newsletter Release 1.0. She added that the third world would benefit the most. ""It's like affirmative action for smaller nations,"" she said.  Where a Bank Finds Cash Banks may be where they keep the money, but when Citicorp itself needs money, it looks to the Middle East. Prince al-Waleed bin Talal agreed last week to invest $590 million in Citicorp. He had accumulated 4.9 percent of the company's stock last year, so his latest purchase could give him 14.9 percent if he converts his new preferred stock to common. He said in 1988 that he ""would love to be a corporate raider""; just a joke, his aides now explain. Exactly where all the money is coming from is unclear. Prince Waleed is indeed a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, but he had to put up his house as collateral to get a loan from Citicorp just a decade ago. Where Citicorp will find even more badly needed capital might soon become clear. Other possible sources include the displaced royal rulers of Kuwait. ""You go wherever there is a lot of spare cash,"" said James E. Akins, a consultant and former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Even though the Saudi rulers are temporarily pinched, he said, ""There is a lot of spare cash in the Arabian peninsula."" COMPANIES   Tisch Takes the Giants  Yes, it's tough to get season tickets for the New York Giants. But $60 million, or more? Fortunately for Preston Robert Tisch, 50 percent of the Super Bowl winner came with the deal. Mr. Tisch, president of the Loews Corporation, bought half of the team from Tim Mara and two other relatives, leaving the other half in the hands of Tim Mara's uncle, Wellington. Loews owns 22.9 percent of CBS, where Mr. Tisch is a director and his brother, Laurence, is chairman. Mr. Tisch has promised to keep his football investment entirely separate from the network. And it's just as well. If the Giants adopted the same financial machinations as CBS, they might start buying back thousands of season tickets to boost the price of the rest, spin off a quarterback or two and sell Lawrence Taylor to the Japanese.11 Jail for Milken, Hope for Drexel  Michael Milken, the financier who studied at Berkeley in the 1960's, is returning to that area on March 4, this time to prison. Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who sentenced him to 10 years on securities charges in November, recommended last week that he serve 36 to 40 months before he is eligible for parole. Cooperation with investigators, said to be asking him about failed savings and loans that bought ""junk bonds,"" might get him out earlier. Even without Mr. Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert might rise again. Drexel convinced its creditors and litigants last week to tentatively accept a fraction of what they claim -- in this case, $2 billion out of $20 billion. A Federal Judge said enough money should be left to allow Drexel to emerge from bankruptcy.  Outlook for Airlines  The Federal Aviation Administration predicted on Friday that the nation's airlines will recover their financial health once the recession and the gulf war end. The agency predicted stable or lower fuel prices, although some analysts disagree. James B. Busey, the F.A.A.'s administrator, rejected the airlines' calls for Government aid. Quincy Jones, Inc.  Bertlesmann and Time Warner may think of themselves as thriving media conglomerates, but the best example might be Quincy Jones. On Wednesday his ""Back on the Block"" album won six Grammy Awards, as many gold-plated horns as he could carry, bringing his total to 25. After last year's Milli Vanilli embarrassment, the award-givers can be assured that Mr. Jones himself originated, arranged, conducted and produced the album. He is best known as a record producer and arranger for musicians from Duke Ellington through Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson. He has also written the scores for 37 movies and produced several television shows and films -- convincing Steven Spielberg to direct and Oprah Winfrey to act in ""The Color Purple."" He has his own record label, and a major stake in a New Orleans television station that he oversees. His television and movie company, Quincy Jones Productions, has received so many uninvited visitors that he had to take its address off its business cards. Amgen's New Drug  The Food and Drug Adminstration gave Amgen Inc. approval for a genetically engineered medicine to help cancer chemotherapy patients fight off infections. Analysts expect the drug to become one of the biotechnology industry's best sellers. INTERNATIONAL   Another Step Toward Capitalism  If socialism, as many in Russia like to say, is the long, hard path from capitalism to capitalism, the Soviets took another halting step in that direction last week. The Government announced that prices would increase at least 60 percent on every basic need except fuel, medicine and vodka. The Soviets are trying to use central commands instead of free markets to reduce shortages, prune subsidies and set prices to more closely reflect production costs. Herbert Levine of the University of Pennsylvania, a specialist in the Soviet economy, questioned how much difference new state prices would make. ""In many of these markets, the official channels are no longer the major suppply channels,"" he said. In his view, barter, private markets, the shadow economy and even commodity exchanges are acclimatizing many Soviets to more capitalist ways. Slovenia's Secession  The Slovenian Parliament's declaration last week of autonomy from the rest of Yugoslavia only ratifies a status that Slovenia's economy has already achieved. Closer to Munich and Milan than to Belgrade, Slovenia has 8.5 percent of the nation's people but about 20 percent of its hard-currency earnings from exports. The Slovenes regard Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, as a flabby cousin wedded to the Cyrillic alphabet and Soviet ways. The Serbs regard the Slovenes as Mercedes-driving snobs. Joseph Tragert, an economist at the Planecon consulting firm in Washington, says that Croatia's eagerness to follow Slovenia out the door might well ignite a civil war because Croatia has a large Serbian minority. ""It's probably the end of Yugoslavia,"" Mr. Tragert said of the Slovenian stand. But like the restive Baltic nations, he added, Slovenia and Croatia are probably too small to thrive as independent states. They might choose a loose confederation instead.  "

The huge capital expenditure at the plant, already among the world's largest, is unusual in an industry with a declining market. Cigarette makers normally spend little on expansion and simply use profits to finance non-cigarette acquisitions.   The plant will have the latest automated equipment, including an experimental production line that spits out 10,000 cigarettes a minute.    The plant is in Cabarrus County, N.C., about 20 miles north of Charlotte. It already has a production capacity of 85 billion cigarettes a year, and the new investment would add 40 billion.   Philip Morris will pay for the capital spending with cash flow and existing lines of credit.    William I. Campbell, president and chief executive of Philip Morris U.S.A., said the majority of the added capacity was to meet surging demand abroad, especially in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong. The new production will also go, however, to the domestic market, where Philip Morris enjoys the leading market share of more than 40 percent.   In the United States, Philip Morris makes a pretax profit of more than 40 cents for each dollar's worth of cigarettes sold. In Japan, where trade liberalization talks have led to greater sale of foreign cigarettes, the company earns nearly as much.   Philip Morris plans to spend the $400 million to enlarge the plant by more than a third, to 2.46 million square feet. The expansion would add 660 jobs to the current 1,800 and $20 million to the $70 million payroll."

But it is not the Japanese we should be afraid of. We are our own worst enemy.   American companies, held hostage by the illusion that breakthroughs are the key to technological superiority and industrial competitiveness, have failed to employ a winning formula. To be competitive, big new ideas must be turned into products and that requires an ability to follow through. This is where we, as an industrial nation, fail. And this is where the Japanese succeed."

Unfortunately, it also demonstrates how American businesses will continue in the future to lag behind global competitors if benchmarking remains the approach of choice.   Learning about the best of the best technology and systems is always desirable. But copying what the best are doing is a mistake of the first order. The Japanese in the 1950's and 1960's ""learned"" a great deal about the best of the best American automobile manufacturers. They obviously did not copy what Americans were doing. The Japanese designed their automobile manufacturing systems with ""break through thinking"" -- install a system that is as close as possible to an ""ideal."" Anyone who has visited both Japanese and American automobile manufacturers recognizes the vast differences: the Japanese factory needs much less space, has virtually no storage capacity, permits great flexibility, etc. They converted the knowledge into practice most effectively.   Companies trying to emulate the best of the best (whether a competitor or not) are just playing a game of catching up. Assuming they were able to install the ""best of the best"" tomorrow, what makes anyone think even noncompetitors will not be further ahead at that time? It is just insufficient to claim that ""our system is as good as the Japanese (or whatever company).""   The principles of ""break through thinking"" make this quite clear. The uniqueness principle points out that each organization, setting, and time is different if for no other reason than the fact the people are always different. Imposing solutions from somewhere else automatically creates huge problems and difficulties in the adaptation process. The ""solution after next"" principle points out the necessity of using what answers you think you may have in, say, five years as the guide in developing today's solution. There is no such thing as ""the best."" The solution after next builds in the directions of continuing change at the same time that creative solutions are being developed for today. The systems principle provides a framework of elements and dimensions to assure thoroughness and completeness while assessing consequences of actions that are being proposed.    Benchmarking generates a false sense of catching up, but the quarry it chases gets further ahead. American businesses instead need to do leapfrogging. Break-through thinking shows them how to this in their planning, designing, improving and problem solving.

Pentagon officials said more than 80 aircraft landed at various airfields. Iran vowed to impound them for the duration of the war, but the officials questioned Teheran's intentions. HUSSEIN GRANTS INTERVIEW In an interview with Peter Arnett of the Cable News Network, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said that ""if Iraq uses oil for self-defense,"" it was justified. The journalist also quoted Mr. Hussein as saying that Iran was offering sanctuary to the Iraqi planes in a gesture of Muslim solidarity. STOPPING THE OIL SPILL U.S. and Saudi officials said the flow of crude from offshore Kuwaiti sources was virtually halted by the weekend's precision bombing. But they said the slick left by some 11 million barrels of spilled oil still threatened ecological disaster. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: The Pentagon listed 21 American casualties as of yesterday, consisting of seven wounded and 14 missing or taken prisoner, a fate shared by 12 allied airmen. Aircraft: The loss of a Harrier jet of the Marine Corps brought the number of American aircraft shot down to 11 in 12 days of raids on Iraqi targets. Seven allied aircraft also were lost. IRAQI FORCES Troops: There was no current information on military casualties. Iraq informed the United Nations yesterday that at least 324 civilians died in air raids, 416 more were wounded and religious and cultural institutions were destroyed or damaged as well. Many of the casualties occurred Jan. 21, when bombs struck two towns south of Baghdad, Iraq said. Aircraft: In addition to the planes at Iranian airfields, the Pentagon counted 26 Iraqi aircraft shot out of the sky and 24 more confirmed to have been destroyed on the ground as of yesterday."

Other than lowering interest rates, what weapons do you have in your arsenal to increase the money supply?    A. Well, obviously we have reserve requirements. . . . I did mention that we were looking at other areas of action to get at the credit crunch, but if we were to resolve the credit crunch, in part it would flow through into the money supply.    Q. What about more liberal accounting rules, say on real estate?    A. Well, I don't want to get into that until we've got some specific policies. There are lots of different things that we can do, but I've become convinced that the vast majority of them are infeasible. But some of them may not be. Some of them may be useful and what I'm getting at is it's the credit crunch that we're focusing on. The money supply is symptomatic of the credit crunch. So it's more important that we resolve the credit crunch than the messenger of the credit crunch.    Q. How severe has that crunch been?    A. It's been as severe as any supply-induced constraint ever, other than from policy actions.    Q. You said that there was some slight evidence that the credit crunch was beginning to ease?    A. There is evidence that the better-capitalized banks are increasing their market share relative to those banks which are less well capitalized.    Q. And what's the implication of that?    A. What you need to get the credit crunch unwound is to change the attitudes of those who are concerned about their capital position and have them return to extending loans to their credit-rated customers. If they begin to lose those customers to competitors, which in this case would be the more well-capitalized banks, some banks will then under those conditions begin to start to be more willing to lend to customers.    Q. When will you know?    A. What I've been getting at is that what we know at this stage is the beginning of that process has begun but we don't yet see any evidence of that lending from the less-well-capitalized banks.    Q. How sensitive is the problem to lower interest rates? Would another point on the Fed funds rate encourage those less capitalized banks and make them move?    A. Well, it's obvious that any incentives you can give -- which means in effect opening up profit margins to the banks -- will clearly induce those at the margin who have been disinclined but just barely disinclined to start to lend.    Q. In retrospect, should you have acted sooner to deal with the credit crunch?    A. No. Because if the credit crunch had lasted for six months, its implications on the economy would probably have been very marginal. It is the cumulative effect of the credit crunch that I find increasingly disturbing.    Q. And you didn't think that would happen?    A. Well, no, I didn't. Looking back, I'm not sure that there's very much different that I would have thought personally to do.    Q. The Fed in general and you in particular were getting credit politically for a long time when it looked as if we were going to have a soft landing. Now that it turns out that the landing is a little rockier, why shouldn't you also get the blame?    A. First of all, if you're asking me whether or not that I thought without the Middle East that whether we would have gotten the soft landing. In July, I would have said yes, 50-50, maybe, most probable that we would have gotten a soft landing. The data that we got in for the months of August and September in retrospect, at least as best I can judge it, increased those probabilities. In other words, we knew actually what happened.    Q. Do you mean it increased the probability that you would not have had a recession?    A. Correct.    Q. What is the implication of the fact that so much lending now is going on outside of banks -- in commercial paper, for example? Does it mean the Fed has less influence over macroeconomic policy?    A. No. It does mean, however, that the trend towards the loss of competitive franchises in the commercial banking system has been going on now for quite a number of years. It still exists. There are increasing alternate means, as a result of technology, which can bypass commercial banking to get financing. . . .    So long as we have a monopoly on a major form of asset in the system, claims against the Federal Reserve banks, it is a sufficiently large instrument that we can affect interest rates.    Q. Is there some business that the banks could get into that would really help pay the rent? Wall Street is having enough problems making money in its own lines of endeavor.    A. The time you want to expand powers is when businesses which they might go into are not operating all that well. Because the real dangers to banks is that if you give them powers at a time when the new business in which they go are flourishing, you actually create possibilities that they may overextend themselves. If they succeed in a cautious environment which is weak, they're going to be non-risk-takers. That's what you want as they phase their way into the business.    Q. If everything goes as you expect and hope, would you guess that the recovery would be a strong recovery?   A. I think that it would be moderate. It depends where it starts from. We don't have that much slack in the economy as of now. If the economy slips further, and that of course is not to be ruled out, then the nature of the recovery will be more vigorous. But you cannot have a vigorous recovery from a shallow decline.    Q. And the banks will have to get over their own crisis of confidence in order to have a recovery?    A. Yes, I would say that is a necessary condition.    Q. Would the banking system be better off with a real thorough round of consolidation in one way or another?    A. I would think that there are a number of institutions which probably would be better off if they merged, and there's no question in my mind that some significant, real cost in savings would occur under those conditions. That is talking about individual institutions. But as far as the system as a whole, the basic issue is that we've got a large number of community banks out there who do very well, and they serve their communities in an exceptionally effective manner. When we know that is when big banks try to come in and take their business away, they fail. So, unless you're going to argue that a lot of those community banking institutions are somehow not serving your community or are unprofitable or unsafe and unsound, none of which one can argue, you can't just merely make a generic statement that we should collapse the number of banks. It is true that we should in certain areas and certain individual institutions."

Harrah's has been the industry leader.   Mr. Wagner began his career in 1965 as a desk clerk at the Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nev., and worked his way up to an executive position before moving to New Jersey and becoming president of the Claridge in June 1985.

While researching material for a book I wrote on family businesses, I found a similar interesting phenomenon taking place these days among young people in connection with their attitude toward ""coming home"" to their family business just as they are now going back home to live because of the recession and economic conditions.   About five years ago, when a young man or woman graduated from college and was offered the opportunity of joining a successful family business, the chances were they would turn it down in favor of trying to make a financial killing in such areas as Wall Street, the legal profession or financial consulting. Many of them did very well for a couple of years, but with the changing times they now are finding themselves out of jobs or with greatly diminished incomes and have decided that perhaps a solid family business, in a glamour area or not, might offer long-term security -- and would have been the wiser choice right from the start.

In part the mess is simply a measure of the failure of the G.D.R's rulers, who would not give up their belief that Germans could even make socialism work.

Around us and a couple of Government centers, there seemed to have been some bombing earlier, but right now, in fact, in the last half hour, the bombing has moved out, seemingly beyond the perimeter of the city to presumably military targets, strategic targets further west, towards Kuwait.   ARNETT: That's correct. And out of the immediate vicinity of Baghdad here. And I just looked out on the street a moment ago and saw a very small automobile driving down there. Peter, look at this. This is a bright flash of light that seems to be a -- it seemed to come across from north to south, and even came up here by us in the hotel. And there it goes -- almost like a shooting star.

ARNETT: Yes, John, that was a heck of a strike. The plane could have been as close as 500 meters in the sky above its target. This certainly has been met with a lot of antiaircraft fire, but it is long gone at this point, John.    HOLLIMAN: Yeah. These planes are moving so rapidly, and with the one bright light on them. I guess that's the engines themselves that we're seeing going by. This is something that I've never covered before, ladies and gentlemen."

Mr. de Klerk, when he called on Feb. 1 for the elimination of the remaining laws upholding the apartheid system, said his Government had been giving attention to the reform of local government ""for quite some time,"" but gave few concrete details."

Even after winning permission last week to fly between the United States and the Continent and penetrate the American market in a host of other ways -- rights no other foreign airline has had -- the British carrier is sounding defeated and distraught. It seems British Airways will have to accept some competition from United, American and Virgin Atlantic at Heathrow Airport, London's most convenient. The day before creditors were to seize Pan Am's planes, Pan Am and T.W.A. won British approval to sell their Heathrow routes to United and American. ""U.S. negotiators have succeeded in weakening British Airways,"" a spokesman for the airline intoned, as the company's chairman spoke of reduced profitability. Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, shed few tears. ""They're yelping so much it's suspicious,"" he said. British Airways already plans to invade the Continent by buying a large piece of Sabena World Airlines and forming a new carrier in Germany. The British deal hardly gives America's feeble old international carriers the strength to rise from their wheelchairs. Pan American World Airways, the sickliest case, is earning only enough from its route sale to perhaps survive until someone buys its remaining assets. And Trans World Airlines said the Transportation Department's ban on the sale of three of its six London routes to American, in the interests of competition, imperils its financial health. Maxwell's Plum, or Prune?  ""Maxwell's Plum,"" said a Daily News headline Wednesday morning. ""Miracle Max!"" and ""Daily News Lives!"" followed that afternoon. Now Robert Maxwell needs to live up to his headlines. The plum he agreed to buy after settling with the unions last Tuesday has shriveled to perhaps half its former circulation of a million-plus, and even less of its former advertising. His purchase of The News -- the Tribune Company is actually paying    him   $60 million or more to take on the newspaper's liabilities -- is based on agreements by the striking unions to accept sharp staffing cuts. Mr. Maxwell, a British publisher, promised to invest what the News called ""mega-money"" -- not to mention the mega-time he might need in his trans-Atlantic schedule to lure scores of advertisers, several hundred thousand readers and Jimmy Breslin back to his pages.  Exxon, and Taxpayers, Pay Up  For a company that earns as much as Exxon, $1.1 billion actually isn't real money. No sooner had the Exxon Corporation agreed to pay such a settlement to Alaska and the Federal Government in the Exxon Valdez oil spill than Lawrence G. Rawl, the company's chairman, said there would be virtually no effect on the company's earnings or image. The company also pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors. Exxon's ability to write off the whole settlement save a $100 million criminal penalty will cost taxpayers an estimated $300 million.  A Purge at Chrysler  Tough times provided the Chrysler Corporation with the perfect occasion to kick a union leader off its board. Cost-saving, Chrysler called it, adding that four of the other 18 members were leaving as well. In fact, it's the loss of labor's voice, responded Owen F. Bieber, president of the United Automobile Workers, a dissident on the board and the only departing member who is not in at least his late 60's. Labor representation, unusual on American boards, hardly seems to have hurt corporate competitiveness in countries like Germany. But by reversing itself on the issue, Chrysler has carried out Detroit's most celebrated boardroom purge since H. Ross Perot left General Motors. McDonald's New Burger  No, McDonald's will not draw in the bean sprouts and oat bran crowd with its new, reduced-fat burger. At best, analysts say, the health-conscious might stop sneering so loudly that they embarrass those for whom dieting means ordering the burger and fries without the shake. Diners who do try the ""McLean"" are likely to be disappointed, said Caroline Levy of Shearson Lehman. ""This doesn't even taste like a burger, based on what I've heard,"" she said. Like the company's recent abandonment of styrofoam containers to placate environmentalists, Ms. Levy said, ""It's good for McDonald's image, but I do not see it as good for the bottom line.""  In Brief  American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, reduced its lowest fares -- reviving the 30-day advanced-purchase ticket -- to encourage travelers frightened off by the Persian Gulf war or the recession. But some other fares are rising. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the competitive practices of the Microsoft Corporation, the dominant maker of personal computer software. Microsoft calls the probe minor and limited, its competitors call it broad-ranging, and the F.T.C. is keeping quiet. The House reluctantly poured another $30 billion into the savings and loan bailout last week. THE ECONOMY   Putting a Leash on '900' Calls  The Federal Communications Commission proposes that callers to ""900"" numbers get to hear the price tags before they pay. Under rules announced Thursday, the ""900"" services would have to describe their prices and offerings, then give callers a chance to hang up before they are billed. No longer would callers applying for construction jobs learn only later that the calls had cost them $18 each, as the Government alleges, nor would callers for nearly useless credit cards end up paying $49.95. Several industry representatives blasted the F.C.C.'s proposal as a threat to legitimate ""900"" services; many provide weather, sports scores and stock information for willing customers.  The F.C.C. is likely to issue its final rules by the end of the year. Harsh Message in Output  Factory output fell in February for the fifth straight month, indicating that the recession continued to deepen. An eight-tenths of 1 percent drop last month brought production to the lowest level since June 1988. Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear Stearns, said that considering last month's dismal employment report as well, the recession now looks to be as long as average. ""The short and mild argument has gone down with the February numbers,"" he said. But consumer confidence appeared to improve in early March after the war. Inflation Just Simmers Along Wholesale inflation continues to simmer despite a tepid economy. While producer prices overall fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month, the core rate, without volatile food and energy prices, rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover, said that like Goldilock's evaluation of the baby bear's porridge -- ""not too hot, not too cold,"" he sees the inflation report as ""not too inflationary, not too recessionary."" Some economists say inflation remains too strong for the Federal Reserve to further ease credit. Modest Cutback From OPEC  With Iraq no longer around to bluster about the need for much higher prices, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed to cut production by only 5 percent, or about a million barrels a day. The agreement demonstrates the influence of Saudi Arabia, which wants to keep prices moderate enough to guarantee long-term demand for its vast oil supplies. With neither Iraq nor Kuwait exporting, most OPEC members have quotas far higher than their previous levels. News of the OPEC agreement nudged oil prices up by only 69 cents last week to $20. The Great Bankruptcy Shield  France had the Theatre du Grand Guignol, presenting murder, rape, torture and suicide. The United States has the bankruptcy courts. The latest example of creative bankruptcy is an Equitable Life Assurance Society production, starring a partly empty 53-story Times Square office tower and grieving investors. The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company accuses Equitable of deceiving other investors and trying to stick them with tens of millions of dollars in losses by throwing the partnership that owns the tower into bankruptcy. This, after Manville used the bankruptcy courts to confront its asbestos claimants; Texaco, to rebuff a challenge from Pennzoil, and Frank Lorenzo, to fend off his striking airline unions. Equitable and Manufacturers reached a tentative settlement on Friday, but negotiations on the exact terms continued. INTERNATIONAL   A Bigger Slice of Soviet Pie  Soviet officials harass foreign businesses, protesting crowds swarm around the Kremlin walls, but Pizza Hut's first two Moscow restaurants claim profit margins higher than in the United States. Russians line up down the block for the chance to pass an hour or two in a Western setting. But the trials of doing business in the Soviet Union have slowed Pizza Hut's expansion plans. Andrew Rafalat, the Pizza Hut executive who opened the restaurants in September, said he first needs to secure domestic supplies of meat and mozzarella cheese, to save the expense of buying them for hard currency in Western Europe and trucking them all the way in. Soviet meat suppliers are still incredulous when he asks them to meet his specifications. ""They say, 'We're giving you a scarce product. We're doing you a favor.' "" Mr. Rafalat, visiting the Pepsico parent company's New York headquarters last week, said he hopes to open some stand-alone take-out windows in Moscow by the end of the year. But as David Williams, senior vice president of Pepsico Food Service International, said, ""Nothing in the Soviet Union comes easily. Nothing is handed to you on a plate."" Except for some American-style pizzas, he hopes. Forgiving Poland  Leading industrialized nations have decided that the proto-capitalist Poles should not suffer for the borrowing binge of their deposed Communist rulers. To aid Poland's progress toward a market economy, officials meeting in Paris agreed to forgive about half the $33 billion owed and ease repayment terms on the rest. While micro-entrepreneurs have lined several of Warsaw's broadest boulevards with their booths, the most ambitious economic reforms in Eastern Europe have also caused severe unemployment. The Trade Police in Japan  Inspectors and police milling around an American rice exhibit at a Tokyo food show last week became, in the view of American officials, a prime exhibit of Japanese protectionism run amok. Japanese officials insisted that the sealed bags and plastic containers of American rice, if not the ""Have a Rice Day"" bumper stickers, violated laws against rice imports. Americans insisted the display was solely educational."

The New Vision newspaper today quoted Eric Edroma, director of Uganda's national parks, as saying that the number of elephants had risen to about 3,000 this year, from 1,350 in 1980 .   He attributed the increase to better training of park rangers, which has made them more effective against poachers and a campaign to educate the public about wildlife conservation.   Mr. Edroma made his comments to representatives of the Ele-Drive Trust, a British conservation group, who were on an African trek called the Great Elephant Trail Expedition.   The team is gathering information on the threats to the African elephant. Elephant tusks, sold mostly to Asian markets, are widely used to make ornaments.   Mr. Edroma said a wanton slaughter of Uganda's elephants occurred during the rule of the dictator Idi Amin from 1969 to 1979. In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species listed the African elephant as endangered and banned the sale of ivory worldwide."

Bruce G. Sundlun violated state and Federal constitutional standards when he closed 45 Rhode Island banks and credit unions.   ""In effect, the Governor is confiscating people's property witout due process,"" said Stephen J. Fortunato Jr., the lawyer who filed the class-action lawsuit on behalf of a depositor at the Rhode Island Central Credit Union. ""There was no hearing, no notice.""   The lawsuit seeks the release of $276 million in frozen assets at the credit union, one of 16 state banking institutions that remain closed.   Mr. Sundlun; the director of the Department of Business Regulation, Maurice A. Paradis, and the state'sgeneral treasurer, Anthony Solomon, were named as defendants in the United States District Court lawsuit.   Thomas Tarro, Mr. Fortunato's partner, said while the Governor could temporarily suspend payments of savings accounts, the bylaws of credit unions require that money placed in checking accounts, escrow accounts, trust accounts and cashiers' checks be made available on demand.   Mr. Sundlun closed the 45 banks and credit unions on New Year's Day because of the failure of their private insurer, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation.   Most of the small institutions have obtained Federal deposit insurance and reopened. But 16 remain closed because they have been rejected for Federal insurance."

And why not? In exchange for promising to cash out bondholders in a pinch, the banks collected fees ranging from one-half of 1 percent to 2 percent of the issues. And unlike interest income, which is earned slowly over the life of a loan, fee income lifts profits immediately.    The test will come now that so many borrowers are defaulting. Citibank alone has about $25 billion of standby letters of credit on its books, more than three times its equity and more than its highly leveraged transactions and commercial real-estate loans combined.   Even so, many experts believe the banks' exposure is modest, given their ability to seize collateral or seek reimbursement from the bond issuers to offset losses.  "

Weiner's Forum article (""Blame the Recession on Tax Reform,"" March 10), while I have no quarrel with the general thrust of the article, I think Mr. Weiner is looking through the wrong end of the telescope when he blames the end of a tax abuse for real estate problems.   The very cause of the problem was the fact that investors flocked to real estate ventures of all stripes because of the artificial arrangements. Undoing those has caused and will continue to cause for some time a considerable degree of pain for those lured into such investments.   But Mr. Weiner blames the cure for being the disease. The fact is that the real disease has caused speculative overbuilding at every level and the real estate markets are coming apart from the oversupply (coupled with reduced purchasing power from a recessionary economy).   By Mr. Weiner's logic, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and now the Resolution Trust Corporation should be held liable for the saving and loan and other banking industry problems!

Occidental's purchase of the 5.4 percent stake in the Church & Dwight Company of Princeton, N.J., was often cited by critics who complained that Dr. Hammer operated Occidental more as a kingdom than as a publicly held corporation.    For years, people mistakenly thought Dr. Hammer was connected with Arm & Hammer. In 1986 he worked out a deal that gave Occidental the stake in Church & Dwight and himself a seat on its board.   Ray R. Irani, Dr. Hammer's successor as head of Occidental, said Occidental was selling its shares back to Church & Dwight for $19 million, a gain of about $4 million.   At the time the shares were bought, Occidental established a joint venture with Church & Dwight to make and market potassium carbonate. Mr. Irani called that venture a success and said it would continue.   Since Dr. Hammer's death, the company has announced an extensive revamping, including selling $3 billion in assets to help trim 40 percent of its large debt load of $8.5 billion.    Among other things, Occidental wants to sell its 51 percent stake in the IBP Corporation, a big meat processor. Also for sale are a coal mining venture in China, a petrochemical venture in the Soviet Union, and cattle and Arabian horse operations -- all pet projects of Dr. Hammer.   Occidental has cut its annual dividend to $1 a share, from $2.50.  Dr. Hammer had vowed never to cut the dividend even though it far exceeded operating profit in his later years.    Occidental's stock rose 12.5 cents today, to $17.375 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange."

The President has not directly responded to the request, which came in a letter from Lee A. Iacocca, the Chrysler chairman, to President Bush. But the Treasury Department indicated that the Administration was not inclined to support protectionist measures like those suggested by Mr. Iacocca.   Excerpts of Mr. Iacocca's letter, which was dated March 6, appeared in The Detroit News and Free Press on Sunday, along with excerpts of the Treasury Department's background paper, which addressed issues raised in the letter. The background paper was obtained by The News and Free Press. A Chrysler spokesman declined to comment on the published excerpts, saying Mr. Iacocca's letter was ""personal.""    In the letter, the Chrysler chairman suggested that if Japanese auto makers could be persuaded to cut exports by 500,000 vehicles this year, they could be limited to their current share of the American market, about 31 percent. Otherwise, he said, Japan's auto makers may cut their prices to reduce growing inventories of unsold vehicles, causing their market share to grow to 40 percent.   ""Unless the Japanese act now to immediately cut back their export shipments, they will begin to 'distress merchandise' this huge amount of overshipment and their share will rocket up again,"" Iacocca said in the letter.    ""I can tell you, Mr. President, at a Japanese share of 40 percent in a depressed industry, Chrysler is gone and Ford could be mortally wounded from a competitive standpoint,"" Mr. Iacocca wrote. ""Even G.M. is at risk unless and until we decide as a nation that a domestic auto industry is a strategic industry and should not be allowed to fall victim to Japan's industrial strategy of targeting key industries."" Mr. Iacocca said his proposed limits on Japanese sales should remain in effect until American auto makers ""regain their footing.""    The outlook for Chrysler has looked increasingly bleak in recent months as the company's sales and profits have dwindled. The entire industry has been mired in a downturn for nearly two years, and as the smallest domestic auto maker, and one that was on the brink of financial collapse just a decade ago, Chrysler appears less able than the Ford Motor Company or the General Motors Corporation to weather the current climate, while paying the huge development costs required in producing a full line of models. Chrysler Stands Alone     None of the Big Three auto makers has prospered in direct competition with the Japanese, but only Mr. Iacocca favors United States intervention against the Japanese industry. Japan's voluntary limit on car exports has declined sharply since the early 1980's, to about 1.6 million from more than 2.6 million. But in recent years, as the Japanese have built factories in the United States, they have been selling more and more American-made vehicles and importing fewer vehicles from Japan.   The Treasury Department managed the Government-guaranteed loans that saved Chrysler from bankruptcy in 1980. Since the mid-80's, the Government has declined to request Japanese export restraints, although Japan has agreed to limit vehicle exports nonetheless.   Indeed, the Treasury Department's background paper noted that the Japanese auto industry has invested $6.4 billion in American plants and employs about 25,000 American workers. Moreover, the Big Three have significant investments in the Japanese auto companies, and they sell Japanese-made vehicles under their own nameplates."

It was invented by Donald Firth of Dartmouth, England, who spent nearly 30 years as a scientist at the National Engineering Research Laboratory of Britain."

In fact, business has become America's second-largest educator. It now spends a record $40 billion a year on education, about three-quarters of this to teach workers basic skills they should have learned in school.   Exactly what needs to be done to fix our schools was spelled out in great detail by two Brookings Institution scholars, John E. Chubb and Terry Moe, in a study published last summer. After analyzing data involving 500 schools, and including 20,000 principals, teachers and students, the researchers concluded that government-sponsored reform efforts have failed because government itself is the problem. The only approach with a reasonable chance of improving education is based on a business model, involving deregulation of both the supply and demand of education through competitive markets and parental choice."

But to many Western economists it is an example of good intentions gone awry, of Mikhail Gorbachev's disheartening brand of administrative incompetence tinged with nostalgia for a puritanical socialist past that never was.   Cutting the currency in circulation by perhaps 20 to 30 percent ""was not totally stupid,"" concedes Ed Hewett, a veteran perestroika watcher at the Brookings Institution. The mountain of rubles in private hands does threaten to bury any attempt to decontrol store prices in an avalanche of inflation. But the sacrifice of all those rubles will be in vain unless it is followed by a determined effort to halt further accumulation of cash -- an unlikely prospect, since much of the money is being handed out to prevent open rebellion against Moscow's rule."

A few days later, the H. J. Heinz Company said it would no longer fish for tuna on dolphin sightings or use drift nets. And in November, McDonald's announced it would do away with its plastic foam ""clamshell"" hamburger box. These headline-making actions, and others like them, signal important changes in corporate environmental thinking. Yet, double-hulled tankers, dolphin-safe tuna and abandoned polystyrene packaging -- while praiseworthy -- do not make corporations environmentally responsible.   One way for multinationals like Du Pont, Heinz and McDonald's to become more environmentally responsible is for them to sign the Valdez Principles, named after the Exxon Valdez, the oil tanker that ran aground in Alaska causing a massive oil spill. This is a code of conduct aimed at improving the entire company's environmental performance. The principles not only require companies to respect the environment but also to market safe products and services and accept responsibility for any environmental damage they may cause. These principles require companies to disclose operations that might cause harm to the environment and to appoint at least one director to represent environmental interests. They also require an annual environmental audit."

Saudi and Kuwaiti units backed by United States Marines and airborne troops were reported preparing for an assault on Kuwait City, while a Marine amphibious force waited offshore. To the north, the 101st Airborne Division sat astride the Guards' supply lines as two other United States Army units, the First and Third Armored Divisions, were reported closing in on the Guards from the west. For the first time in the war, the allies reported the launching of Iraqi Silkworm anti-ship missiles at allied warships off Kuwait, but no damage was reported.

Since then, the service companies that provide equipment and crews to drill for oil, and for the natural gas often found with it, have improved the process vastly. They have introduced supercomputers to spot drilling sites and sophisticated equipment that can even drill sideways (box).    For the three years that ended in 1989, the average cost to produce one barrel of oil in the United States was just $4.82, according to John S. Herrold Inc., an oil research firm based in Greenwich, Conn."

The statement from the ruling Revolutionary Command Council, normally headed by Mr. Hussein, was read over the Baghdad radio and was welcomed by the Soviet Union, which was simultaneously stepping up diplomatic efforts to end the war."

This was a conscious decision. We sought out a deaf person because we too were looking to supplement what, at the time, was a work force with declining reading, writing and, consequently, typing skills. We all learned rudimentary sign language and provided her with a device ($429) so she could make and receive calls like anyone else.   Your article neglects to discuss the problems a small business faces in welcoming those with disabilities: increased cost, for one. For example, an interpreter needs to be hired to help interview deaf candidates and also to assist at staff meetings and similar group events. The least costly one charged us $60 an hour.   We tried to hire other deaf employees because ours was, overall, a positive experience, but we couldn't find a pool to select from. We also tried to hire people with other types of handicaps including those in wheelchairs. But although we had a person devoting considerable time to this activity, we couldn't find interested candidates.   In New York City, there is an additional problem you don't mention: transportation. All who are willing don't necessarily have an office or live along a route with buses equipped with wheelchair lifts. No one talks about these severe impediment.

President Bush warned that allied forces would fire on any other aircraft that defy the ban on Iraqi military flights imposed by the forces that drove Baghdad's troops from Kuwait.   The attack, the first aerial combat since hostilities were suspended on Feb. 27, came as rebellions continued in Iraq. A senior Administration official said that insurrections in the north and south were stronger than Washington had anticipated, but that it was not clear whether the rebellions could lead to the ouster of the Iraqi President.

Direct-mail tests will be conducted nationwide to see if there is enough reader enthusiasm for a weekly Life. Katherine M. Bonniwell, the magazine's publisher, declined to say how large the mailings would be or what would be considered a high enough rate of response for the Time Warner publication to become a weekly.    ""The reason we are doing the test is that we think the monthly is doing well with consumers,"" Ms. Bonniwell said.    A sample of the people who respond favorably to the direct-mail test will receive a prototype issue in March. The prototype will bethe same size as Time magazine, which is smaller than the current issue of Life.   Life's advertising pages were down 22 percent for the first 11 months of the year, according the Publishers Information Bureau. The monthly's circulation is 1.7 million, the same as last year.    Ms. Bonniwell said Time Warner Inc. would not decide whether to make Life a weekly before the summer. Life is also exploring other ways to capitalize on its name, including the possibility of videos, books and foreign-language editions.   A team of editors, writers and designers has been working since last summer on producing prototypes for a possible weekly Life. Details about the changes have been closely guarded, however, and the official word from Time Warner has simply been that the magazine is considering a number of options."

W. de Klerk moved today to smash the legal bedrock of apartheid by announcing that he would scrap the remaining laws on which South Africa's ideology of racial discrimination has long rested.    In a speech opening the 1991 session of Parliament, Mr. de Klerk said legislation would soon be introduced to repeal the Land Acts of 1913 and 1936, which reserved most of the country's land for the white minority, the Group Areas Act of 1966, and the Black Communities Act of 1984, which entrenched the separate status of black townships.    In appealing for the revocation of racial laws, now considered to be virtually certain, Mr. de Klerk went beyond what had been expected by also mentioning the Population Registration Act, which classifies all South Africans into four racial groups: blacks, whites, people of mixed race and Asians. Reversing an earlier Government position, he said that the law, entrenched in the nation's Constitution, would, like the others, be soon eliminated.  Transitional Steps Proposed     He said this could be done through the enactment of what he described as ""temporary, transitional measures"" needed to maintain the present Constitution until a new one can be negotiated and drafted.    ""Should Parliament adopt the Government's proposals,"" Mr. de Klerk said, ""the South African statute book will be devoid, within months, of the remnants of racially discriminatory legislation which have become known as the cornerstones of apartheid.""  [ Excerpts from the speech, page 7. ]   In Washington, the State Department welcomed the proposals as ""dramatic and far-reaching,"" but noted that all political prisoners had yet to be released, as required under United States laws governing the lifting of sanctions. Further Momentum     The speech by Mr. de Klerk today lent further momentum to a process that the President began at the opening of Parliament last year, when the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organizations were legalized and Mr. de Klerk announced his Government's intention to release the congress's leader, Nelson Mandela. Mr. Mandela walked out of a prison farm nine days later.    ""In the short span of a single year,"" Mr. de Klerk said today, ""substantial progress was made. The Government is determined to build on the foundations laid purposefully, efficiently and with due speed.    ""South Africa cannot allow or permit the dynamic process of reform to slow down,"" he told Parliament.    As he spoke, the African National Congress, conducted mass marches in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and some other cities to put pressure on the Government in advance of looming but as yet undefined Constitutinal talks. The anti-apartheid group also sought to underscore the reality that blacks remain excluded from Parliament and from institutional political life.    In Cape Town, Walter Sisulu, a senior leader of the congress, addressed a crowd of perhaps 15,000 people who had gathered outside City Hall.  Insists on Right to Vote     ""We still do not have the vote, and this is what our people want today,"" Mr. Sisulu said. He added that the scrapping of the apartheid laws must be followed by ""measures to retrieve the damage they have done.""    Mr. de Klerk reiterated his opposition to an elected constituent assembly to draft a new constitution and an interim government, something that the African National Congress has demanded.    ""The idea that the present, legally constituted Government should relinquish its powers and simply hand over its responsibilities to some or other temporary regime cannot be considered in a sovereign, independent state,"" Mr. de Klerk said.    But he suggested that the Government might share some of its authority with the congress and with other groups outside the parliamentary process, once the transition to nonracial democracy was under way.    ""Consideration may be given to certain transitional arrangements on the various legislative and executive levels to give the leaders of the negotiating parties a voice in the formulation of important policy decisions,"" Mr. de Klerk said.   Entrenched Inequality     While the elimination of the remaining racial laws will likely signal the demise of apartheid as a legal system, the disparities, inequality and hostility that have divided black and white South Africans under the apartheid system are unlikely to be erased as categorically.    Though public facilities like libraries and community swimming pools were legally integrated in October, many of these remain unused by blacks. Similar recent laws enabling some formerly white schools to accept black pupils when more than 72 per cent of the parents approved have so far to led the integration of 205 schools, a small number nationwide, with generally few black children admitted at each school.   Once the laws cited today are repealed, a black South African will legally be able to live in a white neighborhood and buy land previously set aside for whites. In practice, though, few blacks can afford it. The Government has not said that it will return land confiscated from dispossessed blacks, with little or no compensation, in the last four decades.    Some lingering resistance to change was evident in Parliament, where legislators of the right-wing Conservative Party, the official opposition, angrily walked out during Mr. de Klerk's hourlong speech. The Conservative Party leader, Andries P. Treurnicht, said later that Mr. de Klerk's plans to scrap the apartheid laws struck at the roots of white community life.    ""It is surprising that South Africa now has the only leader in the Western world who is negotiating himself, his party and his people out of power,"" Mr. Treurnicht said.  White Liberals Gratified     However, Zach de Beer, the leader of the liberal Democratic Party, observed that President de Klerk had promised to repeal the Group Areas and Land Acts. But, Dr. de Beer said, ""most of us did not expect that the Population Registration Act would go this year, and we're pleased.""    The Government had said that the Population Registration Act would have to remain in force until a new constitution extending political rights to the black majority was adopted.    But President de Klerk said today that ""following investigation, it would, in fact, appear possible to repeal this act, provided that this is accompanied by the adoption of temporary transitional measures toward the acceptance of a new constitution.""    The total elimination of existing racial distinctions would throw into question the legitimacy of Parliament, which now has separate chambers for white, mixed-race and Asian legislators, though none for blacks. Mr. de Klerk was proposing, among other things, keeping Parliament, and by extension his Government, intact through temporary legal provisions in place of the Population Registration Act.    Gerrit N. Viljoen, the Minister for Constitutional Development, told foreign journalists that the racial classification of all new babies or immigrants would end the day the Population Registration Act was repealed. He suggested that the racial classification of other South Africans, while still on the registration books, would quickly fall into disuse.   The President is not expected to have difficulty enacting his proposed reforms because his National Party and the liberal Democratic Party control close to three-quarters of the seats in the white House of Assembly. The leaders of the Democratic Party have consistently sought discussions with the nation's black majority, and in recent years, Mr. de Klerk has convinced many in his own party that such dialogue is inevitable.  End of Emergency Rule     Since he committed himself and his Government to fundamental change, Mr. de Klerk has repealed the Separate Amenities Act, which let municipalities reserve public services for whites, has opened hospitals to all races, among other changes, and has ended a national state of rule by emergency decree, which restricted political activity.    Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha said that the measures announced today were not aimed at eliminating the economic and other sanctions imposed by Western nations, including the United States.    ""What is happening today is confirming President de Klerk's clear statement that the process toward the dismantling of apartheid and fundamental change in South Africa is irreversible,"" Mr. Botha said.  Tutu Now Doubts Sanctions     The Anglican Archbishop, Desmond M. Tutu, who attended the African National Congress march, told reporters there that President de Klerk's speech made it hard to dispute his seriousness about dismantling apartheid.    ""We are getting very near to where it will be irreversible,"" said Archbishop Tutu, a prominent proponent of economic sanctions. ""It is going to be very difficult for us to continue to ask for sanctions.""   The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act enacted by the United States Congress in 1986 provided that sanctions would end once the Pretoria Government released Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, repealed rule by decree, legalized banned political parties and unfettered political activity, repealed the Group Areas and Population Registration Acts, and agreed to enter into good-faith negotiations with representatives of the black majority.    It further permits the President to suspend or modify sanctions once three of the last four conditions were achieved.    The President told Parliament that the constitutional reform he envisionedd had to be accompanied by economic growth to give blacks real equality. ""Until the pressing problems of poverty and unemployment are alleviated,"" he said, ""constitutional models will be of little avail to us.""               --------------------          U.S. Praise and Pressure     WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler today called President de Klerk's proposals ""dramatic and far-reaching."" But she said that South Africa has yet to release all political prisoners or people detained without trial.   Current American sanctions ban new investment in South Africa; the import of South African arms, iron, steel, gold coins and farm products, and also bar South African Airways flights. They also restrict banking activities.                --------------------          Europeans Encouraged     BRUSSELS, Feb. 1 (AP) -- The European Community's executive body said today that Mr. de Klerk's plans to repeal South Africa's major apartheid laws could lead to a softening of sanctions against the country.   ""The enforcement of these initiatives will allow the community"" to discuss softening the economic sanctions imposed in 1986, said the community's External Relations Commissioner, Frans Andriessen.

But there was deepening anxiety over atrocities that they say are taking place there.   At the same time, conflicting, unverifiable reports of human rights abuses and destruction within the Kuwaiti capital prompted confusion and concern. The sense of foreboding was heightened when several Kuwaiti exile groups said they had lost contact with Kuwaitis opposing the Iraqi occupation in Kuwait City."

A spokeswoman for the Zambian Government denied the report.   It was the latest in a series of reports in German, Egyptian and Swiss newspapers, among others, about the whereabouts of the Iraqi President's family since Iraq invaded Kuwait.   The Daily Telegraph quoted unidentified diplomatic figures as saying that Mr. Hussein's wife, Sajida, and his family fled Baghdad shortly after the first allied air attack last week.   The paper said an Air Mauritania flight took them to Nouakchott, the capital of the Islamic state of Mauritania, a former French colony in the Sahara. Then they flew on an Air Zambia plane to Lusaka.   Reports about Mr. Hussein's family began to surface shortly after Iraq seized Kuwait. An Egyptian newspaper said they had sought refuge in Switzerland. A Swiss and a German newspaper also have reported that they were in Switzerland."

President Bush initially offered to send Mr. Baker to Baghdad for talks anytime before Jan. 15. But, he later modified the proposal and said that Mr. Baker would not go any later than Jan. 3 because the Iraqis might use a later meeting as an excuse that they did not have the time both to see Mr. Baker and still withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15, the United Nations deadline for Iraq to pull out or face eviction by force. Pressure for Talks Grows     But with Congressional and allied pressure for discussions with Baghdad increasing, the White House moved today to extricate itself from this diplomatic bind, one largely of its own making. The President's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, indicated that Mr. Bush would still send Mr. Baker to Baghdad if the Iraqis, who have been insisting on a Jan. 12 meeting, proposed a new date between now and the 12th."

Johnson & Johnson Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals, which makes Mylanta, filed a lawsuit Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan against the SmithKline Beecham Corporation, the manufacturer of Tums antacid. The suit said that a Tums television campaign had falsely said that Tums, which contains calcium, was safer and more nutritious than Mylanta, which contains aluminum and magnesium compounds.   ""We did consumer surveys to see what message people took from Tums advertising,"" said Bob Kniffin, a spokesman for the maker of Mylanta, a joint venture of Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Company. ""We determined that a significant number of people would be reluctant to take an antacid containing aluminum or magnesium.""   Donna Furdis, a spokeswoman for SmithKline, said the campaign provides a ""truthful"" representation of the two products and does not discuss their safety. ""The ad was designed to insure that consumers are informed that Tums is an effective antacid and an excellent source of calcium carbonate,"" she said.    The lawsuit seeks corrective ads from SmithKline and a court order barring SmithKline from making such claims in future commercials."

The North African nations have been circulating a peace plan that would have the Council declare a cease-fire so that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq could cede to resolutions demanding the withdrawal of his troops from Kuwait and then allow Arab peacekeeping troops take their place. The allied coalition would also withdraw its forces under this plan.

It attributed the gains to better buying practices, tighter inventory controls and higher sales in its specialty departments, like prepared foods, which have higher profit margins.    For the quarter, Safeway, based in Oakland, Calif., reported earnings of $27.7 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with a loss of $21.1 million a year earlier. Its sales rose 2.6 percent, to $4.63 billion, from $4.51 billion in the 1989 quarter. The 1989 results reflect a $46 million tax expense on a $460 million dividend from Canadian units.    For the year, Safeway reported earnings of $87.1 million, or 91 cents a share, up dramatically from $2.5 million."

President Gorbachev outlined all the major points of a Soviet initiative developed by himself and the Foreign Minister. President Bush thanked President Gorbachev for his intensive and useful efforts, but raised serious concerns about several points in the plan.    President Bush said the United States will consult with its coalition partners on the proposal. We are in the process of examining the Soviet initiative tonight. The United States and its coalition partners continue to prosecute the war. That is the sum and substance of the situation that we have at this point. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS    Q. Marlin, did President Gorbachev give any indication that once President Bush gave him these concerns that he was going to take those back to Aziz, and did he leave any hope that there may be some give on the part of Iraqis on those points the President raised?   A. They didn't discuss follow-on procedures. President Bush did say that we would be examining these points tonight, and we will be considering then, how we intend to respond. I would not expect anything -- any response -- tonight, anything before tomorrow. But in terms of what happens then, that really is contingent upon how we view the various points in this plan and what action needs to be taken at that time. Excuse me, Helen? Plan's Drawbacks    Q. What are the concerns that -- what are the chief drawbacks as the Administration would see them?   A. Well, we don't want to go into the individual points. Of course, this plan was just announced by the Soviets a very short time ago.    The telephone conversation lasted approximately 33 minutes, and although they did get a chance to go through the major points, we obviously have a considerable analysis to do. But I would emphasize again that as they went through the various points, President Bush did state the concerns that he felt the coalition would have on this matter, both in terms of points that are in the plan that we have problems with, as well as issues that are not included, so there are a number of issues to resolve. Ground War Timetable    Q. But  [ inaudible ]  hold up the ground war, doesn't it?   A. The ground war is a matter that is still under consideration. The war itself continues. We will continue to seek compliance with the U.N. resolutions, and the President will make decisions concerning the ground war as appropriate. This process that was initiated by the Soviets is continuing at a rather intensive pace, but there is not change at this point in our schedule for prosecution of the war. Aziz-Bush Exchange    Q. During the meeting itself, was Aziz in communication with the President? Was there any two-way on that?   A. No, there was no one else on the phone call and no other communications. Ann? Pullout's Prospects    Q. Does President Bush see now here a chance, for the first time since Aug. 2, to reverse the invasion of Kuwait and actually come about this without launching a ground war?   A. Well, there have been innumerable chances since Aug. 2, in the sense that Saddam Hussein could have pulled out at any time. That still is the fastest and most efficient way to end this war.    In terms of this initiative, it's just too soon to characterize it. We need to take a look at it, but I would say again that we have had our hopes raised before. After serious examination there have been significant problems, and certainly the President has indicated there could well be some difficulties here, but we are taking a look at it. War During Talks    Q. How could he prosecute a ground war if indeed the talks are proceeding in Moscow?   A. Well, that's not an issue at the moment. We are proceeding the war -- the air war continues. There's been no decision on the ground war at this time. And we continue to pursue the matter in the Persian Gulf in the most effective and efficient military way possible. Michael?  Terms of Withdrawal    Q. The President has said all along that the 12 U.N. resolutions are what Saddam Hussein must live up to. In the points that the President raised that he doesn't like, the possibility sounds like that there may be a negotiation under way to drop one or more of those points. Can the President live with anything less than full acceptance of all 12 as long as Iraq pulls out of Kuwait?   A. There is no negotiation under way with regard to the United States. I would remind you again that this is a matter between the Soviet Union and Iraq -- that we are commenting on their proposal, and we are not directly involved in that sense. I would repeat once again, as well, that compliance -- full compliance with the 12 U.N. resolutions -- is the goal we seek, and those are the guideposts that we would use in judging any consideration of withdrawal.    Q. Are you willing to go beyond those 12, though -- to scale back any of those 12?   A. We have said repeatedly that we must have full compliance with the 12 U.N. resolutions. There's no change in that situation. Rita? Soviet Plan's Fate    Q. Marlin, aside from raising serious considerations here, you said that we've had our hopes raised before. In the process of reviewing this, do you at least see that there is some hope here that this peace proposal could work if some of these problems that the President sees are worked out?   A.

Marlin, how can you say there are no negotiations going on when Gorbachev tells you his points and you tell them which ones are objectionable, and basically ask him to go back to Tariq Aziz and say -- about these points? Are those not negotiations? Is he not negotiating on your behalf?   A. We haven't asked him to do anything. He's asked our views on these matters. We'll provide them as we have in the last few days, but I reiterate again that this is a matter between the Soviets and Iraq, and we are appreciative that -- of the communication that has told us of these discussions, but we are not a part of the negotiations. Thank you very much."

Levy as vice chairman and chief operating officer. He will be the first company executive in more than a decade to hold both titles.   Mr. Levy, who is 49, was previously Ward's president for the apparel and home furnishings group. He joined the company in 1987, a year before Bernard F. Brennan, its chairman, began a management buyout of the company from the Mobil Corporation. Since then, through a shrinking of the company, termination of its catalogue business and the adoption of a specialty-store approach, Montgomery Ward has generated steady increases in profits and expects to report record earnings soon for the 1990 fiscal year."

Back Health Plan,"  Leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. struck a compromise on health-care reform today, endorsing national health insurance as a long-term goal but agreeing to push for more modest changes for now.    Labor leaders gathered here for their annual winter meeting had disagreed over whether their union should back a Government-financed national health insurance plan like Canada's or less drastic revisions like an insurance pool for the uninsured.    At the urging of Lane Kirkland, president of the 14.2-million-member American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the executive council adopted a compromise that keeps national health insurance as a union goal but pushes the less drastic changes for now because they are seen as having a better chance of passing. A United Front     The compromise, which also calls for uniform reimbursement rates for hospitals and doctors, should allow labor leaders to present a united front once Congress starts debating health- care reform, union officials said.   Mr. Kirkland said that the compromise gave the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ""the latitude, the flexibility, to sit down with the leading players in the House and Senate"" to work out legislation reforming health care.   ""We are not committed to any rigid, single plan,"" he said. ""We are in a negotiating posture.""    But labor officials who worked on the compromise said that ideally an insurance pool would be set up to provide coverage for the 37 million Americans who have no health insurance. That pool would be financed by employers who do not provide benefits to their workers.   The system would be an expansion of Medicare and Medicaid. Changes would include lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 60, rather than 65. 'Play or Pay' System     Big companies that provide health plans for their workers could opt out of the system. It would be a ""play or pay"" system in which employers either provided coverage or paid into the pool.   Labor has stepped up its campaign to bring about national health-care revision. Last summer it began a $3 million television campaign urging changes and held hearings across the country.    Unions view health care as an urgent issue because rising costs have caused breakdowns in contract talks as employers tried to get workers to pick up part of the costs."

Only with composting can recycling rates of 25 percent to 50 percent be achieved.   The author suggests, however, a policy dispute between industry sectors and environmental groups that simply does not exist. No one favors the production of substandard compost. Indeed, the council was created to establish uniform standards for compost quality and, last November, launched a national standards-setting initiative.   The council is against composting undifferentiated waste and provides the forum for a serious, ongoing and technical debate on how to separate elements of the solid waste stream. While some of our members favor extensive curbside separation, others argue that the efficiency and quality control of centralized processing is superior. The discussion is about implementation, not ideology.   The author also suggests an alignment between the waste management industry and environmental groups, on the one hand, and the council and consumer products companies on the other. In fact, the council is a roundtable organization whose membership includes the Natural Resources Defense Council, Waste Management Inc. and the Tellus Institute (mentioned as critics in the article).

Mario M. Cuomo of New York proposes sizable cuts in Medicaid, local aid and the state payroll, which fiscal conservatives have been urging for years. Yet even after these cuts are in place, New York will still be spending more per capita and relative to income than most other states. And the Governor's tax increases insure New York's standing as one of the highest taxed states in the nation. Mr. Cuomo has to do better.   The last eight years saw a historic resurgence of New York's economy. Real personal income rebounded from no growth to average annual increases of more than 3 percent. Per capita income in the state zoomed to 20 percent above the national average in 1989, up from 12 percent above in 1983. Despite the current recession, there are nearly one million more New Yorkers working today than eight years ago. The state's unemployment rate edged to 5.5 percent in December; when Mr. Cuomo delivered his first State of the State message, it was 9 percent."

Under the swap, Courage will buy all Grand Met's breweries, and in return the companies will form a equal venture to manage pubs linked to the companies.   The commission said that the sale and the new pub management venture did not infringe European Community competition rules but that an exclusive 10-year supply agreement between Courage and the venture did.   After consultations with the companies, the commission said Courage could have only a five-year exclusive agreement to supply beer to the venture, called I.E.L. It said that in the five years afterward, I.E.L. would have to buy fewer quantities of Courage beers. This, the commission said, would give the landlords of pubs tied to I.E.L. the chance to buy beers outside those brewed by Courage.   Elders and Courage agreed on the deal last year. In November, the British Government gave its approval, and the companies began talking with the European Community.   While all Courage pubs will be acquired by I.E.L., not all Grand Met ones will be taken over by the new company.   Britain and the commission have agreed to a formula that will leave I.E.L. with 6,950 pubs and Grand Met with about 1,700. Courage has also sold about 1,500 pubs.   The price of the breweries and details of the I.E.L.'s financing have yet to be decided."

Berman and Rotenberg's Forum article poses interesting questions concerning First Amendment obligations (if any) of privately owned electronic information systems (""Free Speech in an Electronic Age,"" Jan. 6). However, their use of ""free speech cases involving shopping centers"" as an analogy is faulty.   In 1980, in Pruneyard v. Robins, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment    does not    permit public access to a shopping center for noncommercial purposes against the wishes of the property owner. However, states were left free to interpret their state constitutions to require access over the property owner's objections. As a result, California became the first state to require such property owners to permit expressional activities on property used solely for commercial purposes.   The article implies that free access to shopping centers is a generally accepted notion, if not downright common. This implication grossly overinflates the acceptance of California's position.    The overwhelming majority of states to consider this issue have ruled in favor of property owners. Giving the pro-access side the benefit of all doubts, only three states (including California) have arguably accepted this position while the position has been expressly rejected by at least Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and (arguably) Washington. WILLIAM J. BERG Atlanta, Jan. 10,    The author is a lawyer who has handled similar cases in Georgia.   "

Developed by Broadcom Inc. of Mahwah, the system cannot transmit television or telephone conversations. But the company said it could relay about 500 words of text every two seconds, using transmitters and receivers, each of which costs less than $1,500. As with a satellite, company officials say, the new system would allow communication with the most remote places on earth. But it would be far cheaper because satellites, which often cost several hundred million dollars to build and launch, are unneeded in these cases.   The underlying principles of the technology, known as ""meteorburst,"" were well established by military researchers in the 1950's. But the technology never entered widespread use because of severe limitations. Inventors of the new system contend that they have overcome the obstacles and already have an experimental system in operation.   The technology uses the trails of charged particles, which continually appear and disappear as grain-sized meteorite specks bombard the earth's atmosphere and disintegrate. During their short lifetimes, they will reflect radio signals like a mirror. To bounce signals to a particular location, a sender has to find a trail that is positioned at the proper angle.   The systems essentially search for such trails, then fire off a brief message when they find one. The problem, however, is that the trails fade so quickly that the systems have thus far been unable to send more than a few words in a single burst.   The new system is designed to pack 100 times more data over each trail. For starters, it links as many as 10 low-powered transmitters, which each send identical messages in a combined signal. In addition, the system tightly focuses its radio beam on a particular trail, rather than broadcasting a wide beam that blankets the sky. According to the company, both moves create a more intense signal that can use each trail for a longer time and pack more data into each burst.   The company hopes to sell its equipment to corporations that want long-distance mobile communications systems for trucks, trains and people working in remote areas.   Charles J. Schmidt and Joseph Kadin, officials at Broadcom, and S. Eugene Poteat, a consultant, received patent 4,985,707."

Not all trash can be composted, but as much as 70 percent of typical municipal solid waste is a candidate for the process. Yard wastes alone, the leaves, brush and grass clippings that accumulate in suburban areas, account for 18 percent of all solid waste, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In the spring and fall, when lawns are mowed for the first time or fallen leaves are collected, that percentage spikes far higher."

NCR said the $90-a-share cash tender offer was still inadequate.   A.T.& T. began the $6.1 billion hostile takeover bid in December, seeking to gain strength in the computer market by acquiring NCR, the nation's No. 5 computer company.    The new expiration date of A.T.& T.'s tender offer is April 30 at midnight. The company said it reserved the right to shorten the period.   A.T.& T., based in New York, said it had received tenders for about 66 percent of NCR's outstanding common shares. The company said it was advised by the depository for the shares, First Chicago Trust of New York, that more than 42.4 million shares had been tendered by midnight Friday. The company had reported on Jan. 16 that 70 percent of NCR's shares had been tendered, meaning that about 4 percent of the shares have since been withdrawn.   ""This was an expected market reaction to the fact that A.T.& T. is not yet in a position to buy the shares because NCR's anti-takeover devices are still in place,"" A.T.& T. said.   But NCR said its shareholders were supporting its position that A.T.& T.'s offer is too low."

Those turbulent emotions were quickly fused into a general anger transferred to the Americans seen as the architects of his, and their, humiliation.   ""You Americans, you are all liars,"" said a Jordanian officer who displayed increasing bewilderment, then hostility, as he listened to the speech with Western reporters at the Ruweishid border crossing into Iraq.   Many in Amman at first refused to believe the news, telephoning international news agencies to inquire whether it was not some kind of hoax. In their heart of hearts, many had known that the Iraqi leader could not prevail. What hurt was the speed of his collapse. Baghdad Radio's Message     When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, President Hussein quickly linked his action to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, insisting that a pullout be linked to an Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands.   ""It looked like Gamal Abdel Nasser coming back,"" said Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser to Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. ""It looked like a knight with shining armor, the hero fighting the Americans.""   For the six weeks of the war, a Western specialist said, Palestinians had chosen to believe the central message of the Baghdad radio's propaganda: allied airplanes might prowl the skies, but Iraq's ground forces, tested in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, had the skills to resist an allied offensive.   Then, two days after allied troops pressed forward into Kuwait, Iraq announced its withdrawal. 'Longer Fight' Expected     Reached by telephone in Cairo, Mr. Shaath said that eventually President Hussein's move ""will be seen as a very prudent move."" But, he acknowledged, ""people expected a longer fight."""

Foley; George J. Mitchell, Senate majority leader, and Robert H. Michel, the Republican leader in the House:    The current situation in the Persian Gulf, brought about by Iraq's unprovoked invasion and subsequent brutal occupation of Kuwait, threatens vital U.S. interests. The situation also threatens the peace. It would, however, greatly enhance the chances for peace if Congress were now to go on record supporting the position adopted by the U.N. Security Council on 12 separate occasions. Such an action would underline that the United States stands with the international community and on the side of law and decency; it also would help dispel any belief that may exist in the minds of Iraq's leaders that the United States lacks the necessary unity to act decisively in response to Iraq's continued aggression against Kuwait.   Secretary of State Baker is meeting with Iraq's Foreign Minister on Jan. 9. It would have been most constructive if he could have presented the Iraqi Government a Resolution passed by both houses of Congress supporting the U.N. position and in particular Security Council Resolution 678. As you know, I have frequently stated my desire for such a Resolution. Nevertheless, there is still opportunity for Congress to act to strengthen the prospects for peace and safeguard this country's vital interests.   I therefore request that the House of Representatives and the Senate adopt a Resolution stating that Congress supports the use of all necessary means to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 678. Such action would send the clearest possible message to Saddam Hussein that he must withdraw without condition or delay from Kuwait. Anything less would only encourage Iraqi intransigence; anything else would risk detracting from the international coalition arrayed against Iraq's aggression.   I am determined to do whatever is necessary to protect America's security. I ask Congress to join with me in this task. I can think of no better way than for Congress to express its support for the President at this critical time. This truly is the last best chance for peace."

Over the course of the 20th century, the media have become the main integrators of our national culture. Older institutions like churches, social organizations, political parties and -- to a certain extent even the family -- have been replaced, at least in part, by the media. No other institution is poised to assume this role.   Even so, much of the media, both print and electronic, is suffering. One explanation for the recent decline in media participation is the demographics of the baby boom. Those people born at the peak of the baby boom -- 1957 -- will be 34 this year. They and their older and younger siblings are hitting their strides in their careers and at home. These people, living in dual-employment families and juggling many time-consuming obligations, simply have less time to devote to reading, watching television and other forms of entertainment."

Not since the early 1980's has the board's monthly survey turned up such pessimism.   Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center, more or less tracks the ups and downs of the nation's economy by suggesting how willing Americans are to spend. January's low reading indicates that a spending spree is not yet on the horizon to lift the nation out of recession."

Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest carrier, certainly appears to be in a position to buy. Moreover, its cash position was strengthened considerably by the decision announced Wednesday by Samuel K.

As a result, the Dutch airline KLM will be able to keep its 49 percent ownership of Northwest, and Northwest will not have to use $250 million to redeem common shares held by KLM."

But there is a growing fear among United Nations, African and other development officials that one vital concern -- the deepening, decade-long economic crisis in Africa -- is unlikely to feature prominently in the post-gulf agenda of the United States and the other major aid-giving powers. Such neglect would deal a severe blow to the profound but largely unreported political and economic reforms being undertaken on the continent -- reforms that are Africa's only hope for reversing what is nothing less than an economic and social nightmare for its peoples.   Even before Jan. 16, when the war in the Persian Gulf began, it was getting increasingly difficult to mobilize the kind of attention from which Africa benefited in the mid-1980's, when a special session of the United Nations put the region firmly at the top of international development concerns. The democratic revolutions of Eastern Europe and the need to financially support their market reforms rapidly pushed Africa down the list of Western priorities. The ending of the Cold War also stripped the continent of its strategic significance to the superpowers. And Africa's puny contribution to international trade made it seem less and less relevant to the economic growth of richer nations."

By early this year at the latest, their mainstay moneymaker -- the one-megabit memory chip, which holds more than a million bits of information -- should have been heading into retirement. It would be replaced by the four-megabit chip, four times as powerful and, more importantly to the sellers, immensely profitable as computer makers all over the world scrambled for scarce supply.   Instead, the four-megabit chip is still limping along. So are the shares of leading makers, like Toshiba and Hitachi, as investors try to determine just how much profits will be pared in the fiscal year starting April 1. Oddly enough, what may hurt the Japanese most is the expiration this summer of the semiconductor trade agreement with the United States, which was intended to curb the Japanese industry and, instead, brought it enormous profits."

They also said that their monitoring of output had improved, and that with so many members producing near capacity, the chances of cheating were reduced."

But there was another recession sandwiched between those two, one that has been almost forgotten.   That was the recession of 1980, and it may soon seem to be a precursor of our current recession. Then, as now, weak economies suffered a quick blow from an unexpected event. In 1980, it was credit controls imposed by a Government fearing inflation. In 1990, it was rising oil prices and falling consumer confidence, brought on by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.   There are big differences between 1980 and now. Then, the problem was rampant inflation. Now it is the economy's excessive debt burden. But in both cases the sharp blow was short-lived. Oil prices are now down, just as credit controls were quickly lifted in 1980. In each case, the Federal Reserve responded by aggressively easing credit."

It was reported late today that seven of them will be insured and could reopen on Monday. The 33 hold $1.5 billion in assets that had been covered by the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, the insolvent state program."

At a news conference in New York, Ken Derr, the chairman, said Chevron's fourth-quarter operating profits would be about $900 million, and after a write-off of a little more than $200 million related to the sale of a fertilizer subsidiary profits would be $700 million, or about $2 a share.   The company reported a loss in the fourth quarter last year of $883 million, because of write-offs; operating profit was $320 million, which Mr. Derr called ""pretty awful.""   For 1990 as a whole, operating profit will be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, he said, compared with $1.2 billion for 1989. The 1989 net was $251 million, after write-offs.   But Mr. Derr stressed that the crisis hurt the company in the previous quarter, and that profits were still modest compared with other industries'. And much of the profit will go into new investment, which will rise $800 million, to $5.1 billion, he said.   At the news conference, and in letters to employees, retirees and shareholders, Mr. Derr said opinion surveys commissioned by the company showed that most Americans think that the American oil companies have assets in the Middle East and that they are manipulating gasoline prices. But Chevron has no substantial assets there, he said, and an Energy Department study found no price gouging.   Mr. Derr said that since July the price of crude oil has risen far more than the price of gasoline, and that this had sharply cut profits in refining and marketing."

With Some Attendant Risks,"" Dec. 30). I disagree with one point.   In the midst of the Saharan campaign, Winston Churchill defined opportunity ""not as a seat but a springboard."" To me a springboard is just what corporate philanthropy provides.    Mr. Macke suggests that Dayton Hudson Corporation's giving is not entirely altruistic. Perhpas, fearing charges of self-aggrandizement, he feels unable to stake such a claim. Still, charity, however it is manifest, does promote altruism. That the returns on such an investment accrue in part to corporate interests should not minimize our sense of the value of giving. The form of social investment constitutes a considerable springboard -- it yields opportunity and altruism at once.   In the early 1970's, Richard Titmuss, at the London School of Economics, conducted a global study of blood donation and concluded that ""how an institution organizes itself has all to do with promoting altruism."" In a recessionary economy, we need all the altruism we can get and Dayton Hudson has organized itself in a manner to promote it. Keep it up Mr. Macke. WILLIAM BAGLEY  Wallingford, Conn., Jan. 9"

Sequent, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., had been the last important computer manufacturer with uninterrupted growth in earnings. Its shares closed today at $11.50 in over-the-counter trading, down $5.75 a share, or 33.3 percent.   While Sequent expects revenue for the quarter to be at least 50 percent higher than the $47.8 million it reported for the fourth quarter of 1989, net earnings are expected to be 10 cents to 20 cents a share, compared with 23 cents in the quarter last year.   The profit decline was caused by a combination of three things, Casey Powell, Sequent's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. These were a drop, from $16 million in the third quarter to below $10 million in the fourth, in the company's original- equipment manufacturing business, in which Sequent computers are resold by the Unisys Corporation; the softening of the economy, and the transition to a new product line.

But your readers should not construe this to mean that all the information about any given stock is built into the stock's price. This may be true about the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, but it is not likely true about second-tier stocks and certainly not true about most small company stocks.   A small company may tell its story in a number of cities and yet not be written about in the national press, evaluated in print by an analyst, or placed on the buy list of a national borkerage firm. And then one day one of those events occurs, and the stock's price begins rising. Nothing has changed except suddenly the company has a following. The buyers bidding up the price of the stock are doing so on the same information that was available on a more limited basis. ROBERT A.

The announcement came as the outcry continued over the deaths of Iraqi civilians in the bombing of what the Americans had identified as a major military command post in Baghdad. The Iraqis say the building was a civilian bomb shelter. Allied military officials said theywere considering dropping leaflets before air raids urging that civilians avoid target areas. As mourners marched through Baghdad, Iraqi officials said that 288 bodies had been recovered so far from the building, including the corpses of 91 children. Reporters touring the installation in Baghdad said they saw no signs of military of communications equipment. 1,300 IRAQI TANKS DESTROYED    American officials are reporting increased success in destroying of Iraq's main ground weapons in Kuwait.

An investigation is under way, but preliminary reports indicated that the incident will be classified as a combat loss because the plane appears to have been hit over Iraq or Kuwait.

IRAQI FORCES    Troops: No precise new casualty figures for the military were reported. There are more than 1,100 prisoners of war in Saudi hands and 122 in American custody, the U.S. command said.

Most child development specialists would agree that children should be encouraged to learn about money and to participate in financial decisions, even at a young age. Money management is akin to self discipline, which is, after all, one of our main parenting objectives.   In this connection, it is vital to realize that a child's judgment will not always be the same as yours. If they opt to buy something which you deem foolish, it is your responsibility to explain your point of view. After that, they should be permitted to make the purchase and live with the consequences. If you do otherwise, you interfere with your objective.   Likewise, if a child immediately spends an entire allowance or earnings and has nothing left for the rest of the week, you may choose to be benevolent the first time. On another occasion, you might even extend a loan which should be repaid. Thereafter, the child must learn the lesson the hard way.   Finally, it is easy for money to assume emotional overtones. Parents should avoid using money as a power base or as a substitute for love.

Myers argues in support of Peter Drucker's view that ""There is only one ethics, one set of rules or morality, one code."" He emphasizes that in business, no less than any place else, ""the locus of responsibility remains with the individual."" That view ignores the role of organizational cultures and their norms.   Executives, chief executives and boards of directors are responsible for the cultures of their organizations. If they fail to lead in making their cultures ethical, they are responsible for the unethical behavior of their organizations' members. Paradoxically, that does not make individuals any less responsible.    Mr. Myers apparently does not recognize that paradox. He quotes a Conference Board report saying , which says, ""Unless ethical considerations are a part of every manager's thought process, both the corporation and individual executives will fail to exercise the level of responsibility which good business represents and law demands."" He asserts that holding ""both the corporation and individual executives"" responsible opens up ""a dual standard of ethics.""   Focusing on both individual and organizational standards does not necessarily open up a dual standard. Ideally the standard of organizations and their members, as well as industries and societies, are mutually reinforcing, not dual.   Executives can encourage mutuality by involving people in creating organizational codes. Involvement increases the likelihood that people will in fact live by the code. And thinking about how that code applies to specific ethical dilemmas can increase people's ability to make ethical decisions.    In my opinion, Mr. Myers' concern about shifting attention away from individual responsibility is being dealt with by those executives whose focus is on encouraging integrity, both personal and organizational. That can contribute to creating ethical individuials and organizations. Granted that is an ideal, but it's worth striving for. WILLIAM GELLERMANN New York, N.Y., March 3"

Blasts,"  Six men from Northern Ireland jailed since November 1974 for the Irish Republican Army bombings of two Birmingham pubs were freed today by the Court of Appeal, after prosecutors admitted that their confessions and police evidence against them were discredited.   The defendants, known as the Birmingham Six, who had insisted on their innocence all along, walked out of the Old Bailey, or Central Criminal Court, this afternoon waving clenched fists, to cheers from supporters outside, some of whom had campaigned for years for their release."

In a letter responding to questions from a member of Congress, the White House chief of staff, John H.

Indeed, market participants said that distributing the huge amount of securities sold over the last few weeks was a much bigger problem for dealers than sorting out the unfolding of the war."

Regulators are not telling -- and could not, even if they were so inclined. For the accounting methods currently used by banks, argues Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's business school, offer only the haziest clues to their net worth.    Mr. White should know: As one of three members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, he watched with chagrin as the savings and loan cowboys ran out of excuses in the late 1980's and left Uncle Sam to pay the bill. His book, ""The S & L Scandal,"" to be published next month by Oxford University Press, reflects on what went wrong and what could be done to prevent a repeat performance."

But the number of advertising pages was down nearly 2 percent.   For all of 1990, advertising revenues were up nearly 2 percent, while pages were down almost 4 percent.   A reason for the disparity between the rising revenues and the falling number of pages was that many magazines raised their ad rates last year.    Still, ""the year was as disappointing for magazines as it was for advertising in general,"" said James Guthrie, executive vice president of Magazine Publishers of America. ""In the 20 years, there have been six similiar soft periods of declines in ad pages."""

Led by Saudi Arabia and Iran, several OPEC members increased production significantly in recent months to offset the daily loss of about four million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude embargoed during the Persian Gulf crisis, the Middle East Economic Survey said.   The survey, published weekly in Cyprus by independent economic researchers, said Iraq's production for the year was down 27 percent from 1989. It fell from 1.75 million barrels a day before the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 to 450,000 barrels a day afterward, used only for local consumption, the survey said.   Crude output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in December was estimated at 23.86 million barrels a day, up 230,000 barrels from November."
