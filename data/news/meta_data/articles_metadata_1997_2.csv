The decision delighted a coalition of Internet users, the computer industry and civil liberties groups. In other decisions affecting business, the court gave Federal prosecutors and securities regulators a major victory, ruling that insider trading laws apply to people with confidential information even if they have no connection to the company involved. The court also struck down a landmark $1.3 billion class-action settlement for victims of asbestos exposure; upheld a New Deal-era Federal marketing program that requires agricultural companies to help pay for industrywide advertising, and denied prison guards employed by private companies the immunity from prisoner lawsuits enjoyed by guards on public payrolls.    THE MARKETS  Forget Stocks. Cut Velvet.  Stocks had a zigzag week that left traders' psyches as battered toward the end of the week as prices were on Monday, when they plunged 192 points on fear that the Japanese might sell United States Treasury securities. Tokyo hastily declared that remarks by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had been misinterpreted, and the market climbed back up. By the end of the week, prices were back at last week's levels. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 108.79 at 7,687.72, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 8.95 at 1,438.15. A much better investment, it seems, was made by Diana, Princess of Wales. At a packed Christie's auction in Manhattan, an off-the-shoulder, ink-blue dinner dress in which she danced at the White House with John Travolta sold for a record $222,500. Altogether the auction of 79 dresses owned by Diana raised $3.25 million for cancer and AIDS charities. The dresses originally cost about $5,000 each, so the gain was more than eightfold."

The Sun's Up!  One can easily imagine today's politicians working through the night, brows furrowed amid clacking fax machines, searching for a way to make the sun rise. When the sun burst upon the scene, there they'd be, cheering and slapping backs. Last week, sure enough, White House and Congressional negotiators trumpeted that they'd solved a ''problem'' that many economists deny is even a problem -- the Federal deficit. The fine points are still being worked out, but there'll be trims in Social Security increases and some tax cuts. More to the point, though, the Federal budget -- while all this fuss was going on -- was moving quietly toward balancing itself, courtesy of a mighty economy.     STOCK MARKET  A 'Correction' Corrected  A few weeks ago, the stock market seemed headed for its long-awaited collapse. It was just taking a little breather, though -- or ''correction,'' in the standard euphemism. On Tuesday, in the latest surge, the Dow leaped 179 points, and the next day it ventured above 7,000 again. Even when word came out on Friday that unemployment had sunk to 4.9 percent -- a 23-year low -- the market kept barreling ahead. Wall Street, you see, doesn't like the job picture to be too good: maintaining the right economic balance is deemed more important than shorter unemployment lines. But there were fewer-than-expected jobs added, so -- by the Wall Street formula -- all was well.     CANAL STREET  Suez Bargains! Today Only!  Look at a globe. When the world's land masses paused in their migratory dance, they left a convoluted inkblot indeed for travelers by sea. Some journeys were straight shots, while others -- from, say, the Red Sea to the Mediterranean -- were maddeningly circuitous. But humanity outwitted the mischievous gods of plate tectonics by building the great canals -- first the Suez, then the Panama. Problem solved, it seemed -- and a solution that left those who run the canals with the ultimate monopolies. But a round-trip ticket through the Suez Canal can run more than $500,000, and it's not even deep enough for some of today's mammoth tankers. So ships are finding alternatives, like sending oil through a pipeline or even taking the long way around to beat the toll. While 22,500 ships passed through the canal in 1982, only 15,000 did so in 1996 -- the fewest in two decades. So, yes, the mighty Suez Canal has joined the discounting craze, slashing prices and offering special deals.     AIR TRAVEL  Enter the Frequent Complainer  A mere instant ago, geologically speaking, it took months to traverse this great nation. Now, astoundingly, you can be transported within hours, sipping a drink and watching a movie all the while. But does humankind cry out its undying gratitude for the miracle of flight? You've got to be kidding. Today's air travelers are so spoiled that the slightest delay or irritant might set them off. One passenger, denied an extra sandwich, punched a flight attendant. Another, asked to wait at the gate, punched a pilot. They curse, they spit, they hurl food trays or suitcases. Passenger behavior, in fact, has become so disruptive that last week the Air Line Pilots Association organized a meeting in Washington, called the International Conference on Disruptive Airline Passengers, to figure out what to do. (Some ideas: more oxygen, less liquor.)    PROMOTIONS  A Rebel's Unlikely Cause  When it comes to marketing icons, there's an unmistakable difference between being dead and being alive. Suppose, for instance, that Fidel Castro had died a fiery rebel's death a generation ago. Today, instead of seeing him as an unending threat to our cozy capitalist existence, we might have Fidel toothpaste, Fidel baseball bats, and, of course, Fidel cigars. If you doubt it, consider Mr. Castro's pal Che Guevara: he's long dead -- for precisely 30 years, in fact, long enough to become a nice, safe, romantic myth. Long enough, in fact, to become a brand name: in a ski promotion, on a CD jacket, on a limited-edition Swatch watch, not to mention five biographies and six movies. And the site of his execution in Bolivia is a tourist spot. A rebel with a strange cause indeed.     MAYORAL ECONOMICS  Staten Island, on the House  Normally, death and taxes can count on some company: rising prices. The best things may stay free, but everything else goes up and up and up. Except, for some reason, the Staten Island Ferry. It costs all of 50 cents to ride now -- rock-bottom cheap when you think of it. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani decided that even that was too much, and starting on July 4, the ride's free. The move coincides with the end of the extra fare for transferring from bus to subway, and the Mayor says it all fits his goal of not penalizing the outer boroughs -- Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx as well as Staten Island. But he possibly also recalled that he has a lot of political support at the south end of that ferry ride.    5TH AND 57TH  Center of a Certain World  Fifth Avenue retailers, especially those near 57th Street, often act as if they're at the center of the world. Do you want to gaze at $1,500 dress shirts? You have an appointment, naturally. How much is that trinket at Tiffany's? Uh, well, never mind. But it's not an illusion. In a sense, this is the center of the world -- in the real estate sense. For the third consecutive year, according to a recent survey, the stretch of Fifth from 49th to 57th ranked as the world's richest retail strip, with annual rents averaging $575 a square foot. You want to open a modest little 30-by-40 shop? It'll cost you nearly $2,000 -- every single day. And second place? Not far -- just around the corner, on 57th. And fourth? Around the next corner, on Madison Avenue. Only Tokyo's Ginza district, in third place, joined this elite Manhattan crowd.    PUBLIC SAFETY  Clamping Down on Brookhaven  A nonprofit organization called Associated Universities was planning a series of events to mark the anniversary of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, which it operated for all of its 50 years. If there's a party, though, the group will miss it. Last week, the Energy Department, the lab's owner, dismissed the organization, saying it had consistently put research ahead of environmental safety. That's hard to argue with, considering the radioactive tritium that has reportedly contaminated the groundwater for miles around. There will be no trade-off between research and public health, Energy Secretary Federico F. Pena vowed. ''Confusion and mismanagement'' at the lab, he said, ''is unacceptable, inexcusable and flat-out wrong.''     BROKERAGE FIRMS  What, Indeed, Is in a Name?  Would you buy a used stock from a firm called Kennedy, Mathews, Landis, Healy & Pecora? Of course you would. The name reeks of respectability. One can almost see the ornately framed turn-of-the-century portraits staring down reassuringly from walnut-paneled walls. But again, alas, things are not what they seem. Those names weren't exactly pulled from thin air -- they were the five original S.E.C. commissioners. But none of them had the slightest connection with the firm. And if you did buy stock from the firm, you might have regretted it. Kennedy, Mathews, which specialized in penny stocks, faced various disciplinary actions, neglected to pay its fines, and last week was officially expelled by Nasdaq.  "

Spending grew at an annual rate of 4.9 percent from September through March, the biggest six-month increase in this decade.    The rise in spending was capped by an increase of one-half of 1 percent in March, helped by a gain of six-tenths of 1 percent in personal income during the month. But economists, attempting to explain the surprising gains, suggest that they may not be sustainable. News analysis. $(Page D3.$)    Several other reports provided signs that the economy may be cooling from its recent torrid pace. Manufacturing activity grew at a slower rate in April, construction spending slowed in March and initial claims for unemployment benefits rose last week. $(D3.$)    Bond Yields Decline Again   Treasury prices rose for a fourth day, as the economic reports suggested that growth might be cooling enough to allow the Fed to keep interest rates on hold. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.91 percent from 6.95. $(D13.$)     Blue-chip stocks retreated after the market's recent strong advance, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 32.51 points, to 6,976.48.

Cautious on Tobacco   In the wake of last week's court ruling that the F.D.A. could regulate nicotine as a drug, the agency is charting a delicate course. As scientists collect data that might bolster the case for reducing or eliminating nicotine from cigarettes, officials are studying the political minefield of regulation. $(A1.$)    On-Line Services in Settlement   Three on-line services -- America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy -- have agreed to an F.T.C. settlement over complaints about their billing and marketing practices. $(D3.$)    Movie Ads Abound on 'Ellen'   Because it was well known that Ellen DeGeneres's character would ''come out'' on ABC's ''Ellen'' sitcom, perhaps the only real surprise was the lineup of advertisers during the show. Most notable was the abundance of spots plugging motion pictures and the dearth of fast-food, beverage and car ads. $(D2.$)     The Leo Burnett agency is charged with wooing buyers of imported cars to Oldsmobile, best known for building stodgy sedans driven by grandparents.

Well, raising taxes and banning cigarette advertising are two options. But so far, at least, this nation has not moved strongly on either front. In Britain, the new Government said last week that it would ban all cigarette ads and bar tobacco sponsorship of sports events. The White House, meanwhile, grasping for a budget deal, ditched a plan to raise tobacco taxes to pay for children's health care. Yes, this is the White House of Bill Clinton, sworn enemy of smoking, and Al Gore, who delivered that emotional anti-smoking speech at last year's Democratic convention. Mr. Clinton backed down after Senator Trent Lott called the tax a ''deal buster'' in the budget wrangle. But Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a key backer of the cigarette tax, said Mr. Lott was bluffing. ''We would have won this,'' he said.     NATURAL ECONOMICS  Planet for Sale (Not Cheap)  A price tag for nature? A dollar value for our planet? Absurd. If a nuclear disaster makes the earth uninhabitable, we can't exactly stroll into Earth Depot and order a new one. But we live, alas, in a society that simply loves doing studies, loves hunching over calculators and spewing out numbers. So, inevitably, the journal Nature just put the value of 17 ''ecosystem services'' (sounds like Roto-Rooter: ''Here to clean your ecosystem, ma'am'') at, conservatively, $33 trillion. But wait. Beyond the absurdity, there's something to this. We constantly make economic choices about nature -- we just don't focus on the cost. An example: New York City water. It's still good, but getting worse because society made a bunch of economic choices not to protect the watershed. Now the city must spend $660 million to protect the watershed -- unless it wants to spend $4 billion for a water-treatment plant. Another example: a growing region builds malls on a flood plain, and the flooding simply moves elsewhere, with more devastating force. Economic choices everywhere. The point of issuing that obviously debatable number is to remind people that those choices, often nearly invisible, are made constantly.    ENVIRONMENT  Welcome Mat for Polluters?  ''Pollution credits'' have seemed like odd creations ever since they were born in 1990. A company that's less filthy than the law allows need not wait for heavenly recompense -- it can sell its virtuous deed right here on earth, a license for filth that can be snapped up by some less fastidious outfit. Or some benevolent soul can buy credits and simply retire them. But in a new twist at this sooty bazaar, Gov. George E. Pataki is offering pollution credits as little Welcome-to-New-York door prizes for companies that relocate to the state. Environmentalists are not amused.    MARKETING DEALS  Tiger Woods, Blazing  Tiger Woods is having one heck of a run in his 15 minutes of fame. He's young, he's a superstar, and he has stormed the white citadel of golf. Outlandish as it may seem, he may even be bigger than Michael Jordan. (''He's fading,'' one observer decreed.) And is he cashing in! No superstar could get by on a trifling $2 million in golf earnings, but weren't those Nike and Titleist contracts, together worth $60 million, enough? Apparently not. Last week, Tiger Woods signed a five-year contract -- reportedly worth $13 million -- to become a spokesman for American Express. And what does being a golf whiz have to do with credit cards? Oh, you just don't understand marketing.    MANAGED CARE  Reforming Health Reform  The word ''reform'' normally brings to mind something battered with age; welfare, to its critics, fit that description perfectly. But last week a Connecticut legislator used the word in a startling context, talking of ''reforming managed care.'' Huh? Managed health care is still in its infancy -- well, early adolescence, maybe -- and was itself created to ''reform'' a health system in dire need of repair. To many people, though, it, too, already needs repair, and last week Connecticut tried to do just that as legislators passed a bill to let the state overturn managed-care companies' rulings on what treatments they will cover. The industry fought the proposal, saying external review was unnecessary because of in-house appeals processes. But lawmakers were swayed more by testimony from hundreds of customers outraged at being denied what they considered reasonable care.    PRISON HEALTH CARE  Economics Behind Bars  Politicians have this thing about being tough on prisoners. It's not enough to deprive someone of sweet, irreplaceable liberty -- they are determined not to appear to ''coddle'' inmates. New York City's jailers are convinced that many prisoners go to clinics as a social occasion, as a break in the grim routine -- and no doubt some do. But when the Giuliani administration last week proposed charging inmates fees for medical care, it outraged prisoner-rights advocates. True, the fee would just be $3, and would be waived for those deemed indigent. But critics say that's a substantial sum for an inmate with limited resources, and they argue that it would lead to delays in seeking care -- and possibly to far more costly treatment later. With contagious diseases lurking in jails, ''it is pretty stupid'' to make it harder to get care, a Legal Aid official said.    MEDICAL RESEARCH  Progress vs. Progress  Medical research keeps bestowing priceless gifts on humankind -- gifts like the discovery, a decade ago, of a way to screen pregnant women for Down syndrome. But our world takes on a bizarre symmetry sometimes -- even as progress gives, progress can take away. No one can deny that lawsuits have evolved into a high art, but it is an art that is not, well, always used to improve the human condition. Take that Down syndrome test: Dr. Mark Bogart discovered the hormonal link that the test is based on, then patented it, then demanded that laboratories pay him a $9 royalty every time they used it (a fee sometimes higher than a lab's reimbursement), then threatened lawsuits against labs that refused. And even though legal experts don't think the patent will survive court scrutiny -- it's ''a little like patenting Newton's law of gravity,'' one said -- some labs are settling, while others are dropping the test. Progress, full circle.    WAGES AT THE BOTTOM  Catching a Rising Tide  If a civilization is judged by wage inequality, the United States gets dismal marks for its record of the last two decades. For even as executive pay has gone through the roof, the wages of workers in the bottom 10 percent of the wage heap have slid 20 percent, adjusted for inflation. Suddenly, though, in recent months those wages have picked up, now rising faster than inflation -- and faster than middle-income pay. And this, in turn, is luring more people on the fringes into the working world. Why the change? Partly it's the ripple effect of the rise in the minimum wage, but mainly it's just a strong economy creating demand for low-skill workers. Temper your rejoicing, though, for the low-wage worker's lot in life, because the recent upturn makes only a tiny dent in that two-decade loss. And when this economy hits a bump, it won't always be top executives tightening belts.    GRADUATING TO JOBS  Downsizing's Children  Remember downsizing? Remember how some nonbelievers said meekly that corporate America was perhaps overdoing it and might one day, its ranks threadbare, repent of its ruthlessness? To judge by the rosy job picture for college graduates, the nonbelievers were right. Schools everywhere have seen a record number of recruiters this year, and the job offers are descending like desperate confetti. The explanation, to some: companies blew it, and desperately need to replace those workers they laid off a few years ago.   "
