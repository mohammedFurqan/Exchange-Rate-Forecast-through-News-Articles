The deal was a crowning achievement for Sanford I. Weill, Travelers' chairman. By combining Salomon, which is strong in bonds, with its Smith Barney brokerage, Travelers will rival Wall Street leaders like Merrill Lynch, American Express and Citicorp, as well as the biggest financial firms in Europe and Japan. Warren E. Buffett, who controls almost 20 percent of Salomon, will exchange his holding for a 3 percent stake in Travelers -- still significant for so large a company. The deal is likely to touch off another round of mergers among insurance concerns, brokerage firms and commercial banks.    THE ECONOMY  First Fear, Then Hope  Durable goods orders rose 2.7 percent last month, well above analysts' expectations, to a record of nearly $186.6 billion, the Commerce Department said. The increase, the third consecutive monthly advance, reflected booming demand for electronic products. That report, combined with a report from the Labor Department that jobless claims fell unexpectedly by 2,000 the previous week, to a seasonally adjusted 306,000, renewed fears that the Federal Reserve might push up interest rates to ward off inflation. But on Friday the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew a bit more slowly in the second quarter than previously estimated. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of national economic activity, grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the quarter, down from the 3.6 percent rate reported a month ago. The new figure eased the fears of a rate increase.    MARKETS  Recovering From a Slide  The slower economic growth, in turn, reinvigorated financial markets. Bond prices were up, sending their yields lower. The 30-year Treasury bond ended the week at 100 5/32, to yield 6.36 percent, down 1 basis point. That helped stocks recover on Friday from a three-day slide. The Nasdaq index hit a record high of 1,689.18, before ending the week at 1,682.24, up 1.87 points. Propelled by a surge of 74.17 on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 7,922.18, up 4.91 points for the week.     COMPUTING  I.B.M. Holds the Chips  I.B.M. plans to make chips early next year that are 40 percent more powerful than the most advanced chips now made commercially. The computer maker said it had solved a fundamental problem, enabling it to use microscopic copper wiring on silicon chips, instead of the aluminum now used. The new process will also cut chip-making costs by 20 to 30 percent. Separately, Intel, which supplies the chips that are the brains of 80 percent of the world's personal computers, said the F.T.C. was investigating whether it engaged in any practices that would deter computer makers from using competitors' chips. Intel is cooperating. But no matter who makes the chips, employers want to be sure they are used for their benefit. Many are cracking down on employees who use office PC's to play games or send personal E-mail.    PEOPLE  Family Values Win  Brenda Barnes resigned as president and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America, citing family reasons. ''Every time you would miss a child's birthday, or a school concert or a parent-teacher discussion, you'd feel the tug,'' said Ms. Barnes, who has three children, aged 10, 8 and 7. Pepsico, the parent company, named Philip A. Marineau, the former Quaker Oats executive who was praised for the success of Gatorade but held responsible for the decline of Snapple, to replace her. He is quitting as president of Dean Foods. . . . William H. Joyce, chief executive of Union Carbide, made a seemingly heroic gesture: If the company fails to earn $4 a share in 2000, he will return his base salary. But some compensation experts were not impressed. He'll be paid the salary, which amounts to only 20 percent of total compensation, and if the earnings fall short of the target, an amount equal to the salary will be deducted from other compensation . . . Ron Carey, the teamsters president, asserted that he was a victim, not a participant, in improper fund-raising. Three top aides have pleaded guilty; he accused them of betrayal.     CABLE TV  The Rates Keep Climbing  Cable television rates are spiraling upward, and two consumer groups, the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union, blamed the F.C.C., saying that it failed to keep a rein on an aggressive industry. Cable rates have risen at three times the inflation rate since the telecommunications law was passed in early 1996, the groups said. They asked the commission to freeze rates and to overhaul its formula for determining reasonable rates.     TOBACCO  Business Better Than Usual  Tobacco industry profits could soar under terms of a legal settlement proposed in June by 40 state attorneys general and cigarette makers, according to a new analysis by the F.T.C. It said the tobacco companies could reap as much as $123 billion in additional profits in the next 25 years if the settlement plan were adopted as drafted. It found that the real cost to industry would be about $207 billion, not the stated $368.5 billion value of the settlement. On the other hand, a Stanford University economist, Jeremy I. Bulow, calculated that the industry could easily live -- and conceivably thrive -- with President Clinton's alternative plan, which calls for raising cigarette prices as much as $1.50 a pack to discourage teen-age smoking.     HEALTH CARE  3 H.M.O.'s Back Regulation  Three big health maintenance organizations joined two consumer groups in calling for more regulation of managed health care, saying that all health plans should be subject to ''legally enforceable national standards.'' Until now, H.M.O.'s had generally sought voluntary, not governmental, standards. But three nonprofit H.M.O.'s with a total of more than 10 million members -- Kaiser Permanente, based in California; HIP Health Insurance Plans, based in New York, and the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, based in Seattle -- said regulation was needed to restore the confidence of many patients.

The Dow industrials plummeted 101.27 points, or 1.26 percent, to 7,960.84. The Dow has now fallen 3.6 percent from the closing high of 8,259.31 it reached last Wednesday -- the sharpest decline in the Dow since it fell 9.8 percent from March 11 to April 11. $(Page D8.$)    The Treasury market suffered its fifth straight loss, with the yield on the 30-year bond rising to 6.67 percent from 6.64. $(D15.$)    The dollar rose modestly, but slipped from its early level, as the losses in the stock and bond markets offset the positive effects of a German central bank decision to leave a key interest rate unchanged. $(D6.$)    A.M.A. to Endorse Sunbeam Goods  The American Medical Association has for the first time agreed to allow its name to be used in endorsing a line of products, in return for potentially millions of dollars. The products, made by Sunbeam, will include blood-pressure monitors, heating pads, thermometers, humidifiers and vaporizers. Advertising. $(A1.$)    Intel Accuses Digital on Patents  In response to a patent suit by Digital Equipment, Intel filed a counterclaim, accusing Digital of violating Intel patents that appear to affect nearly every aspect of Digital's business. Still, Digital's stock rose. $(D4.$)    Tougher Stances in U.P.S. Strike  Both sides ratcheted up the stakes in the United Parcel Service strike. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said that other unions would lend the striking teamsters $10 million a week to help them weather the walkout, and U.P.S. officials warned that business losses could force the company to lay off 15,000 workers. $(A1.$)    Fund Executive Out, in Surprise  Thomas F. Marsico, the portfolio manager of two top-performing mutual funds of the Janus Funds, left abruptly as ''a result of philosophical differences'' with the company, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Marsico was the manager of the $5.3 billion Janus Twenty fund and the $1.5 billion Janus Growth and Income fund. $(D15.$)    Wal-Mart and Penney Post Results  Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, said that net income rose nearly 13 percent in the most recent quarter as each of its divisions recorded a sales increase and a profit. And J. C. Penney said operating earnings grew almost 24 percent as the company cut costs and pared inventories, though net income fell 3 percent because of special charges. $(D2.$)    Over-the-Counter Crackdown  The N.A.S.D. plans to toughen the rules for small companies and brokers that trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board, which has been plagued by fraud, an official said. $(D2.$)    Housing Market Back in Order  For the first time in a decade, prices are rising nearly everywhere in the United States, with 80 percent of the nation's metropolitan areas showing a rise in home prices that exceeds the inflation rate. The strength in housing, particularly at the high end of the market, is even causing some bidding wars reminiscent of the 1980's. $(A1.$)    Clinton to Add Drug Regulation  President Clinton will order changes in the testing of prescription drugs to insure that manufacturers specifically examine their effects on children if the medications are to be used by a significant number of young patients, White House officials said. $(A17.$)  "

In a stunning alliance, Microsoft agreed to invest $150 million in the struggling Apple, and to cooperate on several fronts. That offered Apple a much-needed vote of confidence. Microsoft apparently concluded it would pay too high a price if it let Apple die, since Microsoft is the largest seller of programs for Macintosh computers. And cleaning its own house, Apple changed its board, bringing in Steven P. Jobs, its co-founder, below, to a more official role and sweeping out A. C. Markkula Jr., another co-founder and power broker. Mr. Jobs joins the board with a number of industry and investment veterans, including Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of the software company Oracle and a critic of Microsoft. The changes mean that virtually every major computer hardware and software company -- many of which had been fighting each other -- have entered into the Apple camp. Apple's stock jumped on the news, but gave up some of its gains in Friday's market selloff.     THE BUDGET DEFICIT   A Monster at Bay  The Government's budget deficit is dwindling to a mere $37 billion this year, from $107 billion in 1996. That will bring it to its lowest level since 1974, President Clinton forecast. The strong economy and high tax receipts -- thanks in part to increases passed in 1990 and 1993 -- brought a great improvement even before the balanced-budget agreement he signed into law last week had a chance to take effect. Economists said the budget deal would control the deficit in coming years, however, when the gap between revenue and spending would otherwise begin widening."
