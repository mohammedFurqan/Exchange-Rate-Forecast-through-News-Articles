As the small, dry flakes sifted down through yellow autumn leaves and children made the season's first snowballs, the old women talked of berries, mushrooms, nuts and the flight of birds and predicted that this winter would be worthy of Russia's legends.   But the sudden flurries seemed to have caught the rest of Moscow off guard, and few men in the streets had yet put on the fur hats that are the surest sign that winter has come. They seemed still to be waiting for that mysterious day when all Muscovites, like migrating birds responding to an unseen signal, dress for winter."

Electronic typewriters come equipped with circuit boards, which contain a host of semiconductor chips, eliminating much of the machinery that drives manual and electric typewriters and providing advanced features such as memory capacity. Because electronic devices have fewer moving parts, they are generally considered more reliable than their electric counterparts.    After electronic typewriters were introduced in 1978, sales of electric models began to decline rapidly. At the peak of their popularity six years ago, 10 million electric machines were chattering away in American offices, according to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., research concern. By the end of this year, the number of electric typewriters is expected to be down to seven million, with I.B.M. accounting for 70 percent of that."

Under the terms of the agreement, Dart & Kraft was given an option to buy an additional 1.6 million shares at the same price, which combined with the Cohn family shares would give Dart & Kraft a 36 percent stake in CFS. Dart & Kraft then intends to make a tender offer for the remaining shares. Acquiring the entire company at $33 a share would cost about $290 million."

The move requires the banks to improve liquidity by increasing their capital base, and to toughen their credit policies. The Comptroller of the Currency was particularly hard on First Chicago, which reported a $71.8 million loss for the quarter after charging off $278 million in bad loans. First Chicago's main competitor, Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust, collapsed earlier this year, mainly because of bad loans and an eroded capital base.    Beyond the threat that the Comptroller can remove the banks' senior officers was the signal that Federal regulators would keep a closer watch on the big banks and would try to step in earlier to prevent trouble."

(In Jerusalem, the Cabinet Secretray, Yossi Beilin, said that ''technically'' United States officials were correct that nothing had been finalized, but he reiterated that the Americans had made an offer to postpone until March the $500 million in debt repayments during the talks Mr.  Peres held with President Reagan.)"

Moreover, they generally contend that the adverse effects of withdrawal in this country have not been taken sufficiently into account by the Reagan Administration, which announced yesterday that it was leaving the organization at the end of the year.    Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is a leading opponent of withdrawal in Congress, said before the decision was announced, ''The Administration has never calculated the different alternatives and their cost.''    Several recent studies - including reports by the National Research Council, the National Science Foundation, the United States National Commission for Unesco and the Committee on Foreign Affairs - have argued the advantages of staying within Unesco even while agreeing with some of the Administration's criticisms of the organization's policies."

Those challenges are the warm winter enjoyed by most consuming countries, the discounts offered by Norway and Britain and the task of reducing the price differentials between light and heavy crude oil.   Many other problems await Wednesday's conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries: cheating by about 10 of the 13 OPEC members in official prices or production levels; Nigeria's abandonment of OPEC prices and quotas; conflicts of interest within the organization; its diminishing credibility, and a market psychology that, though fickle, now runs against it.   ''At no point in the last decade has the cartel been faced with so many real and diverse challenges to their ability to control the price of oil,'' said Peter C.

But who would pay the $7 billion necessary to buy a company with a key subsidiary that is losing millions of dollars?   Although Tenneco joins an illustrious list of oil companies rumored as ripe for takeover - Unocal, Amerada Hess, Sun and Mobil, for example, - it is that question that makes most analysts doubt a Tenneco takeover is in the offing.        ''It's not one of the more likely takeover candidates,'' said Raymond J. Urban, vice president and oil analyst at Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ''The stock is selling at about 75 percent of its breakup value, and that would not be an attractive discount to get someone interested in buying the company. There are other oil producers who are selling at a greater discount, such as Mobil, which is selling at 40 percent of its breakup value.''"

Alvin (''Future Shock'') Toffler gave the keynote speech. A Committee on the Future unveiled a blueprint for ''shaping our destiny.'' The 1,700 delegates furrowed their brows over discussions of new technology and ''survival skills.''    In fact, it was a union meeting. The Communications Workers of America, faced with the court-ordered breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, their biggest employer, had called the special convention to discuss strategies for coping with the transformation. By then, the Committee on the Future had already spent 18 months looking for ways to avoid the battering suffered by unions in airline, trucking, and other deregulated industries. ''No other union was doing this kind of thing'' when C.W.A. started its future-gazing, said Glenn E. Watts, the union's president."

Many politicians, political scientists and political commentators had believed - or at least hoped - that Mr. Gandhi would make wholesale alterations in the list of Congress-I candidates in order to purge the party of some unsavory elements and bring in new blood.   Indian politics generally has in recent years attracted a number of what are widely seen as corrupt, unscrupulous and even criminal practitioners.   But as the deadline for candidates to file their nomination papers for the Dec. 24-28 election passed on Tuesday, it appeared that no large- scale change had taken place, though a number of the most notorious figures were denied spots on the ticket."

Nevertheless, analysts noted that the operating profit at the parent of the nation's largest brokerage firm contrasted sharply to a $32.8 million operating loss in this year's second quarter. They said the improvement resulted from somewhat more favorable markets, which sparked institutional business and were likely to be reflected in earnings of the brokerage industry.   Including special items, Merrill reported a third-quarter net income of $80 million, or 87 cents a share, compared with $33 million, or 38 cents a share a year ago. Revenues increased to $1.66 billion, from $1.31 billion last year. The one-time items included a $127 million gain - $46 million after taxes, or 50 cents a share - from the sale of its headquarters building at One Liberty Plaza. Merrill is planning to move to the new World Financial Center in lower Manhattan. Because of a change in the tax laws, the company also had a special tax credit of $9 million, or 10 cents a share, from its Family Life Insurance Company."

The I.R.S. says the 1984 tax act, approved by Congress two months ago, is helping it to block shelters that are essentially tax dodges, lacking economic merit. It also reports that the courts are getting tougher and that the service's success rate in audits has improved markedly.    The Justice Department's tax division, meanwhile, says it will have two dozen lawyers working exclusively on fraudulent shelters.    A tax shelter, basically, is an investment that provides substantial deductions from income otherwise taxable to the investor. Real estate and oil exploration are two of the most popular. The Government regards as abusive the shelters that promise immediate deductions of several times the taxpayer's cash investment, especially if the venture seems to have little prospect of earning profits."

The universities concede they have bent or broken their normal rules promoting wide exchange of new knowledge. But they say that to work on the most state-of-the-art technology, they must be willing to accept, and help protect, trade secrets and product plans of corporations. The companies are spending tens of millions of dollars on the campus research, most of which centers on a new generation of computer software and complex data communication networks.    Critics contend that the spread of secret campus research is just what they warned against when advances in biotechnology thrust universities directly into commercial ventures four years ago. The universities, they argue, have begun to restrict the free exchange of information - considered the cornerstone of academic freedom - to attract big research contracts."

The meeting of the council, which the Palestinians call their parliament in exile, ended late Thursday night with the reaffirmation of the leadership of Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.   The council gave Mr. Arafat the power to develop a joint strategy with Jordan for a negotiated Middle East settlement and to continue his exchanges with Egypt, but did not produce any new peace initiatives because of the fear that this might irrevocably split the organization.   The fact that most of the proceedings of the P.L.O.'s legislative council were carried live and in color by Jordanian television - which can be seen all over Israel - seemed to instill a palpable sense of pride among the local Arabs and gave them a view of the P.L.O. leadership that many of them had never had."

Electronic typewriters come equipped with circuit boards, which contain a host of semiconductor chips, eliminating much of the machinery that drives manual and electric typewriters and providing advanced features such as memory capacity. Because electronic devices have fewer moving parts, they are generally considered more reliable than their electric counterparts.    After electronic typewriters were introduced in 1978, sales of electric models began to decline rapidly. At the peak of their popularity six years ago, 10 million electric machines were chattering away in American offices, according to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., research concern.

Such an alliance would end a kind of vacuum in the Arab world caused by the isolation of Egypt - the most populous Arab nation and once the most influential - for the last five years because of President Anwar el-Sadat's signing of the Camp David accords with Israel.     Such an alliance would also put a new face on the divisions within the region by deepening the isolation of Syria, particularly in its support of Iran against Iraq in the Gulf war, which has entered its fifth year.    Jordan's leader, King Hussein, has made it clear recently that this is one of his key goals.

Take the case of Thomas C. Reed, a former national security adviser in the Reagan Administration.

Mr. Reed is not alone. A growing number of investors are being charged with illegal insider trading. They include not only such obvious targets as clerical employees of brokerage and investment houses or attorneys at the major law firms that handle takeovers, but also members of the Reagan Administration, such as Mr. Reed, and Paul Thayer, the former Deputy Secretary of Defense, who is facing charges of helping eight people make $1.9 million in stock-trading profits by illegally passing along inside information.

The discussion fell under the catchword ''Europeanization,'' and it largely involved a plan to revivify the Western Europe Union, a little-used intergovernmental defense policy agency.     The goal, beyond the officially stated desire to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic alliance, was to take a little distance from the Reagan Administration and from what was widely regarded as its overly confrontational style of dealing with the Soviet Union.   Last weekend, plans for reorganizing the W.E.U. were announced by the foreign and defense ministers of the seven participating countries, who met here without the United States. But the program was discreet, and the put-the- Americans-at-arms-length undertone virtually gone. In the space of a year, it appeared, a central concern of the Europeans had become keeping the United States close at hand."

Many have simply invested wisely and consistently. ''People who just save whatever is left over,'' David Bugen, a financial planner in Morristown, N.J., said. ''usually have too much month at the end of their money.''   The problem, of course, is determining how much money to save each month and then how to put it to work. In deciding how much to save, many people rely on the rule of thumb that they should set aside 10 percent - if not more - of their pay before taxes. ''If people could diligently set aside 20 percent, they'd be making some headway,'' Mark Bass, a financial planner in Lubbock, Tex., said. ''But in real life, there are very few people that can meet that, unless they're extremely disciplined.''    But rules of thumb are not always ideal, because they do not account for differing needs and desires. Planners, therefore, strongly recommend that people sit down and calculate exactly when their children will be in college and what their education is likely to cost, as well as when they plan to retire and how high they expect their monthly expenses to run. On the incoming side of the ledger, pension plan payouts and inheritances can also be estimated."

Although the opposition candidate, Tancredo Neves, has long been favored to win the vote Jan. 15 in the Electoral College, there had been speculation that the Government might alter the succession rules in a last-minute effort to gain an official victory.   But over the last three weeks, the Government of President Joao Baptista Figueiredo has seemingly abandoned the Democratic Social Party's candidate, Paulo Salim Maluf, with leading officials now openly referring to his defeat as unavoidable.   The Supreme Electoral Tribunal has also blocked moves to require Electoral College delegates to vote along party lines. The ruling party held a 36- seat majority in the Electoral College, but a large group of its congressmen who opposed Mr. Maluf's candidacy will be permitted to support Mr. Neves."

The world oil glut persists, prices are falling and the once- mighty Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been humbled - compelled again last week to cut its production in an effort to keep prices stable. And even if another oil crisis breaks out, government officials seem convinced that the International Energy Program - a plan to share oil among the industrialized countries - will cushion any economic hardship.   Such confidence is misplaced. In the event of an oil crisis, the oil sharing plan as it stands would exacerbate the international economic disruption. For the United States, adhering to the program would result in higher oil prices and lower real income.  And it would take no more than a successful attempt by Iraq or Iran to disrupt the flow of Persian Gulf oil to bring the program into operation."

Building that stick was the overwhelming priority. The goal of Administration officials, as they acknowledged all along, was to get that internal process well under way before turning to the external diplomatic goals. To them, that was the only way to provide the strength to stem what they saw as the tide of Soviet power.

Other builders followed, taking sites downtown in the vicinity of Atlantic and Broad Streets, along Summer Avenue and on Tresser Boulevard. Together, they created eight million square feet of office space.   Then, just when it seemed that most development parcels had been taken and the 15-year-old surge of growth in this former industrial town had peaked, a new team broke new ground by jumping to the south side of the Connecticut Turnpike (I-95), the unofficial boundary of downtown Stamford. With the exception of Harbor Plaza, a 500-square-foot office park on Long Island Sound, all of the downtown development had been confined to the north side of I-95."

Eleven OPEC countries committed themselves late Saturday night to the pricing agreement, which is intended to narrow the gap between the official prices for OPEC's heavy crude and lighter grades of oil. But as the ministers boarded planes in Geneva today to return to their home countries, few seemed in a hurry to implement the controversial agreement, which is to take effect Wednesday.

It was the poorest performance since the current expansion began in late 1982.   The revised calculation of the gross national product - the nation's total output of goods and services - was significantly lower than the 2.7 percent estimated a month ago and confirmed the view of an growing number of analysts that the country may already be in a ''growth recession.''    Such a recession is characterized not by an actual decline in output but by growth so skimpy that the economy cannot absorb increases in the labor force, and by a consequent rise in unemployment."

The votes cleared a crucial hurdle in attempts by the Government and NATO nations to keep Spain in the alliance and confirmed Mr. Gonzalez's party leadership.

Yet, proximity is diminishing in importance as the broadening of banking services makes it easier to do business with a bank far from home and office.   Thus, no matter where you live, the big money- center banks can often be the best place to make large deposits, while for the more mundane banking needs, such as checking accounts, a small-town bank may offer a better deal.   In depositing funds, there are often advantages in moving time deposits from a small-town bank to a distant money-center bank because its interest rates are higher. Recently, while the Northwestern National Bank of Duluth, Minn., was paying 9 percent interest on a six-month, $10,000 certificate of deposit, major New York banks were paying about 1 1/4 percentage points more."

Mr. Buscetta, who was on the losing side of a gang war in Sicily, has given investigators a detailed picture of the Mafia and set off arrests and interrogations both in Italy and in the United States, Canada and Brazil."

The proposals, they said, could range from shadowing ships and harassing them to a full naval quarantine of Nicaragua.

Indeed, large firms such as Merrill Lynch & Company, the First Boston Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Company and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., as well as a fast-growing number of smaller outfits, are going well beyond the traditional risk-taking of market making and underwriting, where, if firms buy a company's shares, they do not hold them long."

Partly as a result of these campaigns, a high turnout of 80 to 85 percent of the 48,000 registered voters is expected in the elections, the first the island has held in eight years.    Foreign diplomats and many Grenadians say the main beneficiaries are expected to be members of a centrist coalition party that is favored by the Reagan Administration and the leaders of many neighboring islands.    No reliable polls have been conducted, but many diplomats and Grenadians say they expect the coalition, the New National Party, to win a majority of the 15 seats in the House of Parliament that are being contested. But members of the three other competing parties and four independents say they remain optimistic and some analysts say there is a slim possibility that a coalition may emerge."

It does not take a shocking event like the slaying of Mrs. Gandhi, India's Prime Minister for 15 of the last 18 years, to set off a major outburst of killing, looting and burning. In the past, relatively trivial incidents have set whole sections of India aflame."

INC., operator of the nation's largest drugstore chain, may be suffering from too much diversification. The company announced on Tuesday that the earnings prognosis for its second fiscal quarter was indeed unhealthy.   Revco, which has more than 1,800 stores and annual sales of nearly $2.3 billion, said it expected earnings in the three months ended Nov. 17 to plunge 45 percent because of a number of factors, including the cost of opening new stores, slower growth in sales and increased interest costs.   But analysts agree that the greatest contributor to the financial ills of the company, which is based in Twinsburg, Ohio, was the unexpectedly poor performance of its Odd Lot Trading Company subsidiary, which it acquired last May."

Under United States pressure, these informants said, Belgium has agreed privately not to accept a $1 billion Libyan contract under which it was asked to help the Soviet Union with the construction of two nuclear-power reactors in Libya. Other West European countries with the necessary expertise have also said informally that they would not take over the contract Belgium has turned down, these sources said.    Although Libya says it wants these reactors for peaceful purposes, the Reagan Administration strongly opposed any Western aid for the project, diplomats said. This is partly because of its general hostility towards the Libyan Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, which it accuses of fostering terrorism and subversion, and also because it fears Libya might use the reactors to develop a nuclear weapon, these sources said."

A recession could cause the deficit to soar to $300 billion to $400 billion; a deficit of such size would inhibit fiscal action to combat the recession by increasing spending or cutting taxes further. And fear of recession may prevent the White House and Congress from acting decisively to cut the budget deficit.    A steep United States recession would have dangerous implications internationally. It would cause a slowdown or reversal in foreign investment in this country, due to the combination of falling profits here and a falling dollar. The shrinking of capital flows would mean a shortage of funds to finance both the United States budget deficit, the trade deficit and private investment in new plant and equipment. The shortfall of savings from abroad would keep real interest rates high."

Western consciences dictate that people should not be allowed to starve; but the specialists contend that by saving them, without finding a key to greater food production on fragile lands, too much pressure is placed on that land and it dies while dependence on outsiders increases.    300,000 Said to Die      Since the early 1970's, up to 300,000 people are said to have starved to death in Africa because of drought that first spurred international attention in the sub-Saharan region of Africa."

Founded in 1939 by a Hungarian immigrant, Nicholas L. Deak, the company grew into prominence by making markets in currencies no one else would touch and in later years, by aggressively promoting private investment in gold. Today, it is the largest nonbank foreign exchange and precious metals operation in the United States.   Two much-less-prominent subsidiaries of Deak & Company, however, helped blacken the family's name and sour its fortunes. The two units, operating somewhat like banks, drew allegations from a Federal commission on organized crime that they had been used to launder tens of millions of dollars in drug money. It was these units and these allegations that drove parts of the Deak empire into bankruptcy court last Thursday, the company acknowledges. The Deaks have denied the allegations."

Bridal companies suffered through the 1960's and 1970's, however, and now they occupy only 30 percent of the 198,000 square feet of space in the two buildings at 491 and 499 Seventh Avenue. The rest houses women's sportswear showrooms, some garment manufacturers and other small stock and shipping companies that were attracted by the buildings' low rents and premier location.   Now another round of change has begun. The two buildings have been sold, and the new owners are putting more than $1 million into bringing them back to high standards."

The Israeli practice has been that such correspondents need military permission and must travel with an Israeli military escort officer and that their dispatches are subject to military censorship.    At least twice in the last 10 days, groups of Western correspondents trying to travel south have been rebuffed by Israeli officers, in one case being taken into custody by armed militiamen and driven out of the Israeli zone."

Prudential-Bache recently reported a third- quarter operating deficit of $21.l million, bringing its nine-month net loss to $104.8 million.    Robert A.

''During the last week, I haven't been able to give profits much thought,'' he said.   Maybe not. But in their response to the gas tragedy at Bhopal, India, and in the effort to manage a crisis that may be the worst ever faced by an American corporation, Mr. Anderson and his colleagues at Union Carbide's headquarters here are certainly aware of how much is at stake. They have been trying to strike a difficult balance between the instincts of human compassion, the demands of public relations and the dictates of corporate survival."

As in the past, the Japanese decision Friday night was made with an eye on the United States reaction, a familiar practice that acquired a certain urgency this time because Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will meet with President Reagan in Los Angeles in four days.   While technically the two matters are unrelated, this country's military program is linked to its economic policies by many Americans who believe Japan has failed to carry its weight militarily while accumulating large trade surpluses against the United States. For several years, as a result, the Japanese Government has shaped military spending in the hope of placating American critics and yet not straining its hard-pressed treasury."

The Navy-chartered ship, the Seaward Explorer, drifted into Cuban territorial waters and the 90,000-ton Nimitz, on a port call at Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, was ordered to sea so quickly Friday morning that about 1,000 of its 5,200 crew members were left behind, Pentagon officials said.   The decision to send the Nimitz and an escort ship, the nuclear-powered cruiser Arkansas, to sea was made when the Cuban authorities told the State Department that a Cuban boat might take the disabled ship to a Cuban port for repairs, a State Department official said.   ''We did not want the Cubans to take that ship,'' the senior Pentagon official said. ''The Cubans might have tried to make a political show of the whole thing and hold the crew and ship.

The decline was attributed to supply problems at the General Motors Corporation because of strikes against G.M. in September and October and to a shortage of parts needed for the 1985 models by G.M. supplier companies."

In the House of Commons on Wednesday, the Government, which has a 141- member majority, defeated an amendment to the bill by a margin of only 23 votes. Eighteen Tories voted against their party, and as many as 60 are believed by their colleagues to have abstained to show their distaste.   The bill will abolish the Greater London Council, now controlled by the opposition Labor Party, in favor of the city's 32 boroughs. It will also do away with county councils in six large metropolian areas, also controlled by the Labor Party. This would leave the cities of Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle, Birmingham, Coventry and Leeds without locally elected administrations."

Despite desperate attempts to make good on delivery commitments, scarcely any industrial customers of the company's Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation subsidiary were unaffected, and some had to shut down plants. Fears were rife that the shortage would spread to higher priority customers all along the East Coast - schools, homes, even hospitals. ''We were a prime example,'' recalled Brian E. O'Neill, the pipeline's president, ''of a pipeline that developed a substantial shortage problem.''    Eight years later, the situation is reversed. Transco and the rest of the industry face a prolonged glut - more technically described as ''excess deliverability'' - brought on by deregulation, recession and price-induced conservation of gas and oil. Competition and price have become dominant considerations, a change that has been beneficial to consumers, but that is causing upheaval throughout the gas industry, particularly for pipeline companies."

A senior Administration official said Friday that the United States had decided to withdraw its bar to I.M.F. entry for Warsaw, one of the last major sanctions and probably the most painful of the measures the Reagan Administration took to punish Poland after the imposition of martial law.

Famed in literature, it was feared by many as a time when Big Brother - chillingly portrayed in George Orwell's novel and reviled in Apple Computer's popular commercial - would smother individuality.     But, from the start, the year refused to live up to its reputation. Individualism was rampant and nowhere more than in business. Free- spirited entrepreneurs continued to stun the establishment. And the spirit of capitalism, stirred by a conservative Administration in the White House, spread across the land."

To correct that attitude among future managers, two graduate schools have developed intensive programs in what they call ''cross-cultural communications,'' or ''global management.'' They combine a study of the culture - the political system, religion, anthropology - and the language of a country or region, with traditional business school courses.

FOR one brief shining moment, in   this town where the Minuteman   statue stands guard, there existed an economic Camelot of sorts. It was Data Resources Inc., whose economic forecasts were religiously followed by America's biggest corporations. At D.R.I.'s head was Otto Eckstein, the bright and charismatic Harvard professor who became a multimillionaire when he put his vision of the economy into a 1,200-equation computer model and sold it to corporate clients.   Young people flocked to work with Mr. Eckstein and D.R.I. economic forecasts were required reading from the White House to corporate board rooms. But that day is over: Mr. Eckstein has died and the Camelot he created is gone. D.R.I. is finding that its core business - selling the number crunching ability of its big Burroughs computer - is in trouble and the market for economic analysis is flooded with new entrants.

But unlike the platforms nearby or in offshore areas around the world, which rest on steel or concrete towers, Hutton is perched above a buoyant hull that is tethered to the seabed by long steel cables. The cables are stretched to hold the hull down in the water, limiting its horizontal movement and eliminating vertical bobbing.   Conoco, the oil company that operates Hutton, is convinced that it represents a design breakthrough that will lead the oil industry into waters far deeper than can be tackled with existing structures.    Hutton, which cost just under $1 billion, or one-third more than originally budgeted, has proved to be marginally more expensive than traditional designs would probably have been."

Shultz said today that the United States should counter the flow of Soviet arms to Nicaragua by arming Nicaragua's neighbors.    At a news conference just before he prepared to leave a meeting of the Organization of American States here, Mr. Shultz said, ''We have to help our friends put themselves in a capacity to resist the aggression that comes from those arms, and we have been doing so.''   He said the United States should provide other Central American nations with ''a security shield against the aggression that has been launched from Nicaragua against its neighbors,'' and declared that the program to do so ''is increasingly successful.''   Mr. Shultz also stressed that the United States ''has worked quite hard for quite a long time'' on negotiation of a regional peace treaty that he said would lead to disarmament."

Indeed, while high interest rates have been a bane to home buyers and other borrowers, as well as to economists concerned about the strong dollar, they have been a boon to individual investors. In the past few years, small investors, who normally have bypassed the bond markets, have decided the yields are too good to pass up.    Nowhere is this more evident than in tax-exempt municipal bonds. Once the domain of institutional investors, such as banks and insurance companies, that market is now inundated with small investors, who buy about three-fourths of all new tax-exempt bonds. The appeal of tax-exempt bonds, which are issued by states, local governments and local government authorities, is that the interest paid on them is free from Federal income tax.    ''Why invest in a money market fund earning 11 percent, when you have to give back half of it in taxes?'' asked Howard Brody, a New York City insurance broker. ''I'm better off buying New York Power Authority paying 10 percent.''"

''Before, they used to say that every Israeli had to be a general,'' said Yaacov Fisher, senior economist at the Bank of Israel. ''Now they say that every Israeli has to be an economist.''    The crisis, economists say, has been produced partly by excessive military burdens but also by the peculiar structure of Israel's political system, the economic restraints of Zionism, years of living beyond the nation's means and sheer mismanagement by some of its governments.      A Different Israel to Emerge      The Israel that emerges from the crisis, the analysts here contend, will be a different place, with a lower standard of living for its citizens, a lower military budget, some very high unemployment or a combination of the three.

After another in a series of cutbacks, France will build only one reactor next year and one in 1986. That schedule is a considerable comedown from the five or six reactors a year built during the 1970's when the country was hurrying to reduce its dependence on oil from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Today, the program is credited with having helped make France the world's leading seller of nuclear goods and services. But the program's very success has left the Government concerned that it may have gone too far, that by the 1990's France may be burdened with an expensive surplus of nuclear power unless it can increase electricity use inside the country and increase exports of nuclear- generated current to its neighbors."

They have since cleaned and refinished some of the frames and plan to redo them all as part of a general renovation that will bring back some of the classic features of the building, which was erected in 1910 as the headquarters for Union Carbide.        The building, whose address is 310 Madison Avenue, was purchased in June, along with three smaller adjacent buildings taking up the entire Madison Avenue frontage from 42d to 41st Streets, by Madison Plaza Associates, a limited partnership.

So he requested and won stockholder approval of an amendment to Sun's articles of incorporation.    ''On many occasions in recent years,'' he explained, ''shareholders of some companies have been badly treated because of hostile takeovers, which were made in two steps. In the first step, an acquiring company pays one price, usually in cash, to obtain a majority shareholder position. Then, in a second step it offers a different price, usually lower and often for a consideration other than cash and of questionable value, for the remaining outstanding shares.''"

Now that the White House has brought the true sizes of those deficits to light - $200 billion a year and up for years to come - the thin ranks of the no-tax- increase cult have been further depleted. This is as it should be in light of the mounting damage the deficit is inflicting on the economy and the impossibility of controlling deficits by budget cuts alone.   Clearly, ''growing our way out of the deficit'' is a non-starter. Martin S. Feldstein, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has pointed out that even with a wholly implausible 5 percent rate of real growth, the deficit would still hang at $150 billion by the fiscal year 1989; at the growth rates that prevailed in the 1970's, it would be more than $300 billion."

It received a noticeably unenthusiastic response from President Reagan and Congress.   The Treasury argued that its plan to reduce tax rates while eliminating many popular deductions and other tax preferences was fairer, simpler and more conducive to economic growth than the current system.   But the President took care to say that many changes might be made before tax legislation is submitted to Congress next year, and leading members of Congress expressed doubt that such a sweeping plan would be enacted.   A Comparison of Rates    Altogether, according to Treasury officials, taxes paid by individuals would be lowered by 8.5 percent, and taxes paid by companies would be raised by 25 percent.

Investors today can choose from hundreds of software programs, much of it more sophisticated than the early programs.

Implicit in the continuation of the credit is a shift in the use of taxes to promote economic development and growth. From giving priority to aiding the so-called smokestack industries - whose 1981 tax breaks the Treasury now wants to repeal - the Treasury plan would change the emphasis to aiding the growth of high-technology industries.   Ronald A. Pearlman, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, said in an interview today that the Treasury proposal was meant to be economically neutral. The intent, he said was not to embody a particular industrial policy."

What strategies should an investor now follow? Three professionals - Leon G. Cooperman, partner of Goldman, Sachs & Company, Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Charles Flather, executive vice president of the State Street Research and Management Company, Boston - give assessments in a discussion with editors of The New York Times.    Q.HOW would you assess the investment climate at present? Is this a time to be fully invested, or would you counsel caution, heavy cash reserves?     COOPERMAN: My response would be somewhere between the extremes - closer to heavy cash than no cash. I don't think it's the time to be fully invested. In my view the stock market is still moderately overpriced relative to fixed-income securities, so the fixed-income markets offer a good alternative to common stocks. Secondly, we're at a time in the business cycle that has typically presented problems for the market - past the peak rates of growth in gross national product, in production, in profits. Also, the institutions' cash reserves are a bit low, and normally that's not been a good sign for the market."

Q. I will be retiring soon and instead of receiving a monthly pension check, I want to take my pension in a lump sum payment that I can roll over into an Individual Retirement Account. But I have been told that I can do an I.R.A. rollover only with that part of my pension that represents my company's contributions to the plan, not the part that represents my own contributions. Why?  A. The reason is to protect your contributions from being taxed twice. In a contributory pension plan such as yours, the money that you put into the plan comes from after-tax dollars. In other words, your salary, after income taxes have been deducted, is further reduced by any contributions you make to the plan. But while your contribution remains in the plan it accumulates interest tax- free."

''This strike has no possible industrial justification,'' Mr. Walker told a cheering audience at the Conference Center here on the Channel coast. ''This strike has little to do with the future of the coal industry. It has everything to do with a Marxist challenge to the roots of parliamentary democracy. It will not succeed.''"

But that's not necessarily so, according to Joel Popkin, a Washington economic consultant.  The September figure is expected to show a rise of only $2 billion or so, compared with $6 billion in August and $7.1 billion in July. ''But the decline occurred largely because of the sharp drop in auto sales that month,'' Mr.  Popkin noted, ''and not because the consumer is overburdened with installment debt.'' Continuing labor problems again depressed domestic auto output in October, causing sales to fall to an annual rate of 6.9 million units, from 7.9 million in September. As a result, Mr. Popkin expects sluggish growth in installment debt to continue in October. But the trend should reverse in the final months of the year. ''The recent decline in interest rates should stimulate sales of autos and other durables normally bought on credit,'' he predicted."

Few traders predict that gold will fall to the $100 mark last seen in 1976, but the precipitous drop from 1980's $825 level has raised concerns about whether gold will retain its reputation as a safe harbor during times of uncertainty. Indeed, more traders seem to be wanting dollars as the hedge, especially since the American inflation rate is staying so unexpectedly low. The relationship between the dollar and gold shifts occasionally as the world economy changes, and some investors apparently have greater faith in the continuing strength of the dollar than they do in gold. And traders note that gold is still high, both historically and when adjusted for inflation.      The improving American economy bolsters optimism at home and abroad, as did the 2.8 percent ''flash'' estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth. The G.N.P. estimate was a bit of a surprise; most predictions had put expansion at barely 2 percent. But because so many statistics have been substantially revised this year, analysts said it was too soon to say the recovery is galloping again. Still, the report was encouraging after a lackluster summer and fall."

The officials, speaking on the eve of Prime Minister Shimon Peres's visit to Washington, said that in exchange for a pullout, the Israelis would also insist on an expanded deployment of United Nations forces in southern Lebanon as well as a role for the Israeli-backed militia known as the South Lebanon Army.    But, in contrast to their previous proposals, the Israelis are no longer insisting that Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon, that there be a formal signed withdrawal accord, or that Israel get political concessions from the Lebanese Government, the officials said.   U.S. Mediation Is Sought      The officials, who are involved in the formulation of Israeli policy, said they believed the Israeli proposals were a realistic basis for negotiations with the Syrians and that Mr. Peres would try to enlist the Reagan Administration's help in playing some kind of mediation role with Damascus. The Israeli Prime Minister, who was in New York today, is to begin talks in Washington with Reagan Administration officials on Monday."

Regan seemed contented Friday before his weekend departure for his vacation retreat in Florida. He sat in one of the wing chairs of his Treasury Department office, the portrait of Alexander Hamilton peering down from above the fireplace, a glass elephant filled with jelly beans on the coffee table. He looked crisp in a navy blue suit, polished black shoes and a navy blue tie emblazoned with little Santa Clauses.    Mr. Regan turned 66 that day, a year beyond the moment when the company he once ran, Merrill Lynch, would have retired him with a gold watch and a nest egg that he suggested a few months ago was worth about $30 million. But the septagenarian next door on Pennsylvania Avenue had other plans for his Treasury Secretary. ''The President suggested that if I tried to leave,'' said Mr. Regan, ''he'd shackle me to my desk.''  Man of the Hour      Donald Regan is the undisputed man of the opening hours of the second Reagan term. He is the author of a remarkable proposal to overhaul the nation's tax system that has brought wails from groups that think they would be hurt, such as major business organizations, charities and New York State. But it has found support among apolitical tax reformers, for its simplicity, and among many leading Democrats and economists, for its elimination of special preferences for business and the rich."

Some of those who watched the network news broadcasts on Ethiopia have asked why they appeared only in late October and early November and why the famine was suddenly available for viewing in electronic images whose instancy belied the slow development of the Ethiopian pain and starvation.    Most of the answer lies in the difficulties the Marxist Government of Ethiopia put in the way of journalists who had become aware of the growing seriousness of the famine months before but could not get permission to enter the country to gather information, film and pictures.    A broadcast tape that appeared on television in Europe and North America late in October and led to an outpouring of charity apparently opened the Ethiopian gate to other journalists."

The gradual erosion of the country's dollar to a level of about 76 cents in United States currency, although raising the cost of living, has made exports considerably more attractive. The bigger car models made here, which Canadians complained about five years ago when gasoline prices were skyrocketing, are now best sellers.    Even the country's militant United Automobile Workers union does not seem so menacing to American companies - despite the strike deadline faced by General Motors on Wednesday - when they consider the currency differential and the fact that the Canadian federal and provincial governments pick up the tab for medical benefits.   'In the Right Place'    ''The fact the companies are a success is the result of circumstances over which they've had no control,'' said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Vilas-Fisher Associates Ltd. in New York.

Few, with the notable exception of Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, have pointed out that a cooperative Federal Reserve would be able to eliminate much of the nation's budgetary red ink and that a bull-headed Fed will lead us to disastrous, irreparable troubles.   So far, the budget balancing act is seen in terms of a major tax increase, punitive spending cuts or a deep recession. But in fact, a balanced budget is possible provided the Fed cooperates with the White House on a unified Governmental program to provide the capital necessary to bring interest rates way down, cut in half the financing costs of Government, business and residential housing, and at the same time, increase the growth of production capacity to at least a 5 percent annual rate."

The heavy supply - to be followed by another $28 billion or so of note and bond offerings by Nov. 8 - is a warning flag in the credit markets. But there are other developments suggesting that investors and securities dealers can absorb the new issues without substantially higher yields.    ''With monetary policy easing, there should be little concern over the supply of Treasury issues,'' said Herbert E. Neil Jr., a vice president and economist at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. He added that the Fed had fostered lower interest rates for a variety of reasons: low inflation, a sharp slowdown in the economy from the first half, and slow money supply growth the past three months."

The rehabilitation is in Siamese- twin, three-story town houses at 1821 and 1823 Madison Street in Ridgewood that were ravaged by fire in 1980. All 12 railroad-flat apartments had to be vacated.    The wrecked buildings surely would have been demolished, said Paul A. Kerzner, president of the Greater Ridgewood Restoration Corporation, without the availability of the tax credits.

Just 11 weeks before the 686-member Electoral College meets to choose the country's first civilian President in two decades, a majority of state governors belonging to the official Democratic Social Party have backed Mr. Neves, a 74-year-old former Governor of Minas Gerais.   The latest endorsements, which President Joao Baptista Figueiredo called opportunistic, came amid charges that campaign managers of the party's official candidate, Paulo Salim Maluf, had tried to buy votes and were seeking a secret ballot in the Electoral College.   They also coincided with mounting evidence of nervousness among senior army officers at the prospect of an opposition victory. One Brazilian newspaper reported this week that plans had already been drawn up to declare an emergency in Brasilia when the college meets on Jan. 15 to prevent demonstrations and live broadcasts of the vote."

United States labor leaders and members of Congress have recently pressed President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador to resolve the case, contending it is a test of his commitment to improve the human rights situation in El Salvador.    Many members of Congress voted to increase military and economic aid to El Salvador after Mr. Duarte's election in May, saying, in the words of Representative Clarence D. Long, Democratic of Maryland, that they wanted ''to give him a chance.''    They said Mr. Duarte's pledge to improve the Salvadoran judicial system and to curtail human rights abuses was a key factor in their support of the additional aid."

Disasters involving poison gases tend to touch a sensitive nerve among Western Europeans. Older people recall the disastrous use of such gases in World War I. Moreover, large quantities of poison gas, for military use, are stored in Europe by Soviet bloc and Western armed forces, and negotiations to reduce their amounts or ban them altogether have achieved little.   Bayer A.G., the giant West German chemical company that produces methyl isocyanate, the gas released in Bhopal, India, at two plants in Europe, ruled out the possibility of a similar accident and said it did not intend to halt production. The company produces the substance for use in pesticides at factories in Antwerp, Belgium, and at Dormagen, on the Rhine River about 50 miles north of here,"

By contrast, with its latest issue, The Cable Guide, run by an attorney and an accountant out of Horsham, Pa., reached a circulation of 5.8 million. Distributed in 700 cable systems, the program guide, which is aimed at people who buy cable services such as Home Box Office or Showtime as well as basic cable, is the nation's best- selling cable magazine.    That the four-year-old Cable Guide has succeeded where the nation's biggest magazine publisher failed suggests that survival in that business takes more than money or magazine experience. What is critical, analysts say, is an understanding of the cable industry."

The investigation was described as covering trading going back at least several months.

Market participants, meanwhile, debated whether the Federal Reserve System would cut its discount rate.    From the opening, the tone of the markets was positive, set by the report that the Producer Price Index fell two-tenths of 1 percent in October, for the third consecutive monthly decline. This tone was bolstered as the day wore on by a relatively low Federal funds rate and a prediction by Henry Kaufman, the Salomon Brothers economist, that the Fed would cut its discount rate."

Specialists in the Government securities market said there were no new economic or financial developments to explain the drop in prices. But they added that there was no additional good news to push up bond prices, which had increased about 8 1/2 points, or $85 per $1,000 bond, between the end of August and last Monday. The increase in prices since late August had reduced the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds to slightly less than 11 1/2 percent Monday from about 12 1/2 percent."

For some people, it must have seemed odd that the leader of the Communist German state, which came into being in part to smash the might of German industrial barons and capitalist cartels, should have wanted to see Villa H""ugel, from which Krupp is now run. After all, the Krupp family's role as gunsmiths to Prussian kings, German kaisers and Adolf Hitler made it, in the eyes of much of the world, an emblem of German expansionism and Prussian power - hardly an encouraging history in the view of East German Commmunism.    But the explanation for the curious link between the Communist and the Krupp empire is Mr. Honecker's old friend, Berthold Beitz, the 71-year old industrialist who has headed the $5.5 billion steel concern for the past 31 years.   A man who saved thousands of Jews and Poles from Nazi extermination camps during World War II, Mr. Beitz is today a national statesman and a Krupp strategist, trying to restructure his company's role in a deeply troubled steel industry, while traveling widely to establish or cement the contacts that have benefited Krupp and German industry during his long tenure."

Mr. Galman was killed by security men at the scene of the assassination.    The action today, which involves the issuance of subpoenas by a three-member Government tribunal, does not necessarily mean that charges will be filed against the 26 people. But it does indicate the Government prosecutors have determined that the accusations are worth investigating."

Or how about into discount priced gold - for later delivery, of course? These and dozens of other get-rich-quick schemes are over the telephone.  Most investors suspect they are too good to be true - as they are - but far too many are taken in.   But outright chicanery is not the only pitfall awaiting investors today.  The number of new securities products has exploded in recent years, and the competition to sell them is fierce.  Even the discerning investor, or savvy broker, can become bewildered.  As a result, expensive disputes can arise even in dealing with a well intentioned broker, from a well known brokerage house.  The investor needs to know that when these problems arise, remedies can be pursued, and brokerages have an obligation to resolve problems.   ''Ten years ago, a stockbroker sold stock,'' Jonathan G. Katz, head of the consumer affairs department of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said.  ''Now they are financial advisers.  They handle all sorts of investment products, and some brokers can't keep up with it all.''"

Long- and short-term interest rates fell, although not as sharply as they had on Thursday. The closely watched rate on Federal funds, reserves banks lend one another, slid to an average 9.80 percent, down from 9.92 percent Thursday, but then rose to 10 1/4 percent late in the session.    The decline in market rates spurred fresh expectations that banks will cut their prime lending rates again. Banks could move as early as next week to 12 percent from the 12 1/2 percent rate that prevailed after this week's cuts, several economists said. Although changes in the prime generally lag behind rather than lead the market, such a decline could act to bolster investor sentiment, according to analysts."

For more than three years a small group of Texaco employees and students and faculty from Louisiana State University have been planting seedlings and erecting fences to build up sand dunes against the tropical storms that pound shoreward from the gulf at regular intervals.   Timbalier is a barrier island, and in the bay behind its nine-mile bowlike shape are protected a thousand small wooden oil wells that look like matchboxes from the air, and fragile wetlands along the Louisiana shore - breeding grounds for the largest commercial fishery in the United States.   Without the barrier, the wells and wetlands would be destroyed by the storms. Instead, the island, barely a half-mile wide, has absorbed the shock and is gradually being eroded. So with quiet intensity, little publicity and no fanfare, the highly unusual partnership of oil company officials and ecologists has been waging its own war against nature."

With unquestioned faith that less regulation and lower taxes would revive lost prosperity, the President has presided over a strong recovery and a moderation of inflation that would have been scarcely imaginable during his first years in office when the nation sank into a deep recession.    The Reagan legacy after nearly four years in the White House includes an inflation rate tamed almost to the inconsequential levels of the 1960's, a vigorous economic recovery now nearly two years old, rising employment, sharply lower individual and corporate taxes and - less happily - a huge budget deficit that helps keep interest rates up and the dollar overpoweringly strong. Above all, there's a new mood of confidence that leads some to assert that the world's mightiest economy, though battered in spots, stands on the verge of returning to the halcyon days of an earlier postwar era when recoveries were strong and inflation mild and of little concern.    ''There's a change in perception around the world from the United States being a lousy place to do business to it being the best place in the world to invest,'' says James F.

The gas, methyl isocyanate, was released from the plant a week ago, spreading across the city and killing more than 2,000 people, according to official counts, and as many as 2,500, according to other reports."

''We're quite upbeat,'' Christopher H. Phillips, president of the council, commented in an interview.    ''Having lived with this thing for the last 12 years, we've learned to avoid extremes of euphoria and pessimism,'' he said. ''But because of what the Chinese themselves are doing, the situation now is more encouraging than it's ever been.''"

A senior official in the prosecutors's office insisted that the case would come to trial, but he complained that it was ''fragile,'' primarily because key United States documents relating to the case were unavailable to prosecutors. Under agreements between Rome and Washington, the Italians do not have the right to the documents because a case against the bank was not brought to court in the United States.   The official said that the Milan prosecutor, Luca Mucci, who earned a reputation for toughness investigating several financial scandals, including the spectacular 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, based his case on documents siezed from Citibank by Italian Treasury investigators. In its investigation, however, the Treasury concluded in 1982 that there had been no wrongdoing."

The Chinese, claiming sovereign immunity, felt this was unfair, and the case became what the State Department termed a ''major irritant'' in American-Chinese relations."

Shareholders and creditors of the company, hoping to recoup their losses, often hone in on the auditors, who tend to be the deepest pockets left in the financial rubble.    Sometimes the suits seem to come in waves, as they did in the 1970's for Peat Marwick, at the time the largest of the Big Eight accounting firms.    These days, Arthur Andersen & Company, which is now the nation's largest accounting firm, has been thrust into the uncomfortable spotlight, embroiled in a rash of multimillion-dollar lawsuits seemingly at once.    ''As long as it's sporadic, it's part of life, but I think Arthur Andersen has crossed that threshold,'' said Richard L. Kaplan, a former Arthur Andersen accountant and now a University of Illinois law professor and member of the Illinois Committee on Accountancy, a state regulatory body."

The latest cuts were further indications of an easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in light of what appears to be controlled growth in the economy. Even though investor optimism is high, analysts cautioned that interest rates remained volatile.

In an interview at her office at the United States Mission, she took credit for reducing the level of polemics by third world countries against the United States and Israel. ''Israel has not been expelled, and the obsessive anti-Israeli attacks have significantly diminished,'' she said. ''Most countries no longer attack the United States at all in debates.''"

Prof. Kenneth E.

''A 10 percent price increase would lead to a 4 percent decrease in consumption,'' Professor Warner said. ''The implications are that if the tax were to be increased, you would observe an increase in revenues because the increase in the price would not be outweighed by the decrease in consumption. Further, you would expect to see a decrease in consumption that ultimately would reduce deaths as well.''"

Jenrette got his first taste of business by selling insurance. He wasn't too successful - his customers kept saying they'd rather buy stocks. That lesson sent Mr. Jenrette to Wall Street, where he was one of three upstarts who founded Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., a trend-setting firm that rattled the industry with its maverick ways. Now, with the purchase of Donaldson Lufkin by the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Mr. Jenrette's career has come full circle and he's back in insurance again.     This time, he's operating on a much higher plane. Next January, Mr. Jenrette will resign as chief executive of Donaldson Lufkin and become vice chairman of Equitable. He plans to keep a foot in each world - he'll stay on as chairman of Donaldson Lufkin and spend the bulk of his time on the firm's matters. But, he also will work closely with Equitable, figuring out ways to draw the two financial companies together. ''No way am I going to be retiring,'' said Mr. Jenrette, 55, in his office furnished with early 19th century English antiques. ''I'll still be working full time.''"

But several economists contend that the pace of military spending is likely to slow and that the Reagan military buildup will not contribute as much to economic growth in the future as it has so far.   Some economists also contend that large Federal deficits, which were in part caused by the boom in military spending, will keep interest rates high next year, leading to slower growth in many industries and offsetting some of the impetus from arms outlays.    ''Defense spending was one element that pushed us toward a boom,'' said Roger Brinner of Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting firm. ''But now defense is part of the problem that is pushing us'' toward a slower expansion."

The British Government will sell control of the company to the private sector on Nov. 28.   Most analysts here are predicting a price in the range of 125 pence to 130 pence a share, which works out at current exchange rates to between $15.90 and $16.50 for Telecom's American Depository Receipts - each equivalent to 10 British shares - when they are traded in New York. Whether the world's largest-ever share sale will be a good deal at that price depends on what one makes of Telecom's assets and its prospects.   The approach analysts are taking follows the old adage that, ''if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.'' Telecom is not comparable to any company traded on London's stock exchange, but it bears a passing resemblance to America's telephone utilities, and analysts are using that as a starting point."

But so far, the resulting glee has not extended to consumers - and is unlikely to do so for some time. Lending rates for consumers are sticking at high levels as market rates - including those paid on deposits - have declined.  ''Historically, consumer loan rates are more 'sticky' than market rates when they start to drop, but they are even more 'sticky' this time around,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express. He said consumer rates are now one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point higher than they have generally been relative to market rates.    According to Mr. Sinai, the average cost of funds to banks - what they pay in the Federal funds market when they borrow from each other - has fallen by 2 1/2 points since early October. But the prime, to which many loan rates are tied, has slid just 1 1/2 points. Mortgage rates have slipped less than 1 percentage point. And a Shearson survey showed that 48-month auto loan rates have not dropped at all. Installment credit rates have also held steady. Citibank's Visa and Mastercard customers, for instance, pay 19.8 percent interest, a rate unchanged since 1981."

Although Nicaragua is torn by civil strife, there were no reprted clashes today. The Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the largest of the pro-American guerrilla groups fighting to depose the Sandinistas, had called a one-day cease-fire."

In this case, the party was hosted by the Interior Department, which had invited the nation's oil companies to bid for leases off the New England coast, including the Georges Bank. Sixteen companies had indicated that they were interested in drilling in this part of the Atlantic and would bid. But on the day of the lease sale, Sept. 27, not one of them came forward with an offer to buy a lease.    That was a watershed in the Reagan Administration's much-debated program to lease vast areas along America's coasts for oil and gas exploration. By not bidding, the oil industry was in effect saying that it is losing interest in offshore exploration in domestic waters because of rising drilling costs and increasingly slim prospects of making a profit."

Stressing high performance and engineering advances, the Europeans are fielding such makes as the Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Audi, BMW and Saab to do battle with Detroit's traditional view of the luxury car: a big, lushly appointed highway cruiser with a large engine, like the Cadillac and Lincoln. In recent years, the Japanese joined the fray, exporting the Toyota Cressida and Nissan Maxima, among others.    The imports are increasing their market share at a time when luxury models of all kinds, including the traditional makes, have become more popular, accounting for about 10 percent of total sales this year.   Some American auto executives now concede that they were as unprepared to meet the Europeans at the top of the market as they were to take on the Japanese several years ago at the lower end. ''We didn't recognize as early as some other parts of the world that the market for luxury vehicles was changing in terms of what it wanted in addition to the traditional elements of comfort, image and prestige,'' said John O. Grettenberger, the general manager of Cadillac."

Wells Jr., joined the top management team at Sun Banks Inc. in 1975, he paid what he thought would be ''just a social call'' on Harry V. Keefe Jr., head of the stock research firm of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Mr. Keefe, however, was not about to pass up a chance to learn more about the troubles then afflicting the Florida bank holding company.    ''He didn't mince any words with me,'' said Mr. Wells, who recalls he was ''marched into a conference room and put on a speaker phone with a couple of institutional investors.'' The grilling, led by Mr. Keefe, ranged from questions about the current status of the bank to what was being done about past problems. ''He gave me a real going over. But I respected him for it,'' said Mr. Wells, now Sun Banks' president and chief executive officer.    Putting bank executives to the test of investor scrutiny has been Harry Keefe's trademark for nearly 30 years. The Wall Street firm that he has built is clearly the source, nonpareil, when it comes to critiquing and trading bank stocks, say institutional investors. And it has an equal presence among corporate treasurers, who rely on the firm's credit ratings of banks to choose where they should park short-term funds and maintain ongoing relationships."

The Israeli decision, which came as the Green Party delegation was in Beirut on a Middle East tour, brought into relief a simmering controversy within the five- year-old party over the anti-Israeli tone of a working document prepared for the trip.   According to Israeli diplomats, the decision to ban Brigitte Heinrich, a 43- year-old member of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, was made in light of a 21-month sentence imposed on her on gun-smuggling charges in Karlsruhe in 1980.

He said Mr. Calero had contacted him several days ago and complained specifically about an article in The New York Times in which Mr. Chamorro disclosed that he and other rebel leaders had been coached by the C.I.A. on how to win Congressional support."

It was still a drought year, and one of black Africa's few food-exporting countries once more fell short of the needs of its eight million people. Zimbabwe will have to import, or get in aid, plenty of its staple food, corn, as well as most of the wheat for its cities' bread-eaters.   But as the beginning of the rainy season raises slight hopes for an end to the drought and a normal growing season for 1984-85, Zimbabwe can reflect on an accomplishment that sets it apart from the rest of a continent whose farmers every year produce less food for more mouths than in the preceding year."

The final passage of the bills, expected next week, will end the 32-year monopoly of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company, privatizing the Government-owned telephone company and allowing competition for telecommunications services and equipment.   One-half to two-thirds of N.T.T.'s stock is to be gradually sold to the public - although ownership will be limited to Japanese citizens.   The move is part of an international trend to deregulate telecommunications and put Government-owned operations into the hands of the private sector. Earlier this month the British Government transferred just over 50 percent of British Telecom to private hands in a public offering that was heavily oversubscribed. Unlike Japan's plans, however, some British Telecom shares were made available for foreign buyers."

It is too complicated, it is unfair, and it retards savings, investment, and economic growth.   Under the current progressive tax system, all taxpayers face higher marginal tax rates in order to make up for the revenue lost by numerous special preferences, exceptions, and tax shelters used by a relatively small number of taxpayers.   As a result, the tax system is complex and inequitable. It reduces economic incentives, hampers economic growth, and is perceived to be so unfair that taxpayer morale and voluntary compliance have been seriously undermined."

A factor was a seasonal adjustment in auto industry prices. Foods, gasoline and heating oil were up. Economists welcomed the report as a still further indication of the deceleration of inflation but they cautioned that it also reflected the slowdown in economic growth. (Page 1.)   Big institutions are forcing down the commissions they pay securities firms, leading to worries on Wall Street of another blow to profits. Recently, brokers have been concerned that the commissions could plummet to as little as a nickel a share, down from an estimated 8 cents now and 10 cents at the start of the year. (31.)"

But he said this ''important and urgent work'' must be realized in fidelity with the Gospel, which prohibits ''recourse to methods of hate and violence.''    The Pope's remarks underscored the central theme of the teaching known as the theology of liberation, which he said ''maintains a preferential option'' for the poor. But at the same time, he condemned the use of the Marxist concept of class struggle in the furtherance of that goal. Class struggle figures prominently in the views of some leading exponents of liberation theology."

The United States is Mexico's sole export market for natural gas, but Mexican imports account for less than 1 percent of the natural gas used in the United States. The suspension will mean a loss to Mexico of about $260 million a year. By contrast, Mexico's oil exports provide income of nearly $15 billion a year."

Pressure is growing within the governing Liberal Democratic Party to drop an eight-year-old understanding that Japan's military budget should amount to no more than 1 percent of its gross national product.   A recommendation to that effect was made over the weekend by a Liberal Democratic study group. Within the next few days, an advisory panel to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is expected to propose that the military budget ceiling, first adopted by the party in 1976, be changed to a more ambiguous ''about 1 percent'' of the G.N.P.   A certain urgency has entered the debate because Mr. Nakasone's Cabinet has only until the end of December to prepare a budget plan for the fiscal year beginning April 1. Military spending is already within a hairbreadth of the 1 percent mark, and it would almost certainly be pushed over the limit if the increase is similar to those provided in recent budgets."

The statement came as Czechoslovak authorities lifted a police cordon around the embassy, where dozens of East Germans seeking asylum in the West have taken refuge. West Germany closed the embassy indefinitely on Friday in an apparently unsuccessful effort to keep more refugees from entering.    Czechoslovak officials offered no explanation for the removal of the police, who had been deployed around the embassy to keep more East Germans from gaining access. The officials have refused all comment on the situation since the influx of refugees into the embassy began last week."

While the economy was still growing, he suggested, the decline in the rate of expansion could seem almostas traumatic as an outright contraction.   Not everyone approved of the term. Herbert Stein of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers suggested that one might as well call a dog ''a growth horse.'' But the concept stuck, and in the last few months it has became fashionable to describe the current economic slump as a growth recession. (Gross national product grew at an annual rate of only 1.9 percent last quarter, compared with 10.1 percent in the first quarter and 7.1 percent in the second quarter.)"

''When the Assembly convenes in January, the Sandinistas will be facing a strong and belligerent opposition, most of which was elected on explicitly anti-Communist platforms,'' said Adolfo Evertsz Velez, a leader of the Socialist Party of Nicaragua. ''They are going to have to make concessions.''    The opposition's determination to press its demands indicates that the Assembly will reflect a relative diversity of views. But key decisions that will determine the power of the Assembly, such as whether it will have the power to approve the national budget, remain to be made."

Clough, a Boston-based   portfolio strategist, when the second leg of the   bull market will begin, he replies, ''You've already seen it.'' He's not particularly gloomy over equity prospects, but looking ahead over the next year he sees the likelihood of a ''start-and-stop'' market with the broad stock averages in November 1985 perhaps ending up about where they now stand.    As director of investment policy for Cowen & Company Institutional Services, Mr. Clough's job is to provide advice to professional managers who, in turn, direct the assets of pension funds and other pools of institutional money. Much of his work centers on analyzing year-to-year changes in production, shipments, backlogs, sales and overall economic data in an effort to seek out the potential for both industry segments and individual companies."

With pageantry and athletic events, Seoul formally dedicated the Olympic Stadium that will be the main site of the Games to be held here in four years. The efficient, early completion of the 100,000-seat stadium south of the city center was a good indication of the importance that South Korea attaches to the Games as an advertisement for itself.    Official statements emphasize familiar Olympic themes of world peace and understanding. But organizers of the Seoul Games also make clear that they see a singular opportunity to demonstrate before a global audience how far the country has advanced economically and socially."

Boone Pickens, chairman of the Mesa Petroleum Company, asserted today that the primary aim of his bid for the Phillips Petroleum Company was to obtain the full value of Phillips stock for its shareholders.   In a series of meetings with institutional investors and analysts here, Mr. Pickens said that oil company managers needed to address the fact that the appraised values of many companies were vastly different from their market prices.   This has been a recurrent theme in his previous bids, including the profitable attempt to take over the Gulf Corporation a year ago that prompted Gulf's acquisition by the Chevron Corporation. Mr. Pickens has portrayed himself as a champion of shareholders, saying that they have been hurt by low stock prices."

Speculation about the changes has alarmed the opposition and spawned rumors of an impending coup - not against President Joao Baptista Figueiredo, but against moves to return the country to democracy after two decades of military rule.   ''Coups aren't proclaimed, they are carried out,'' said Jose de Magalhaes Pinto, a Government party deputy who, as Governor of Minas Gerais, played a key role in the 1964 coup. ''And if I had power in the my hands,'' he said, ''I would carry one out now.''"

The Fed's Open Market Committee has eased its grip on the nation's money supply since last summer and interest rates have come down significantly, but only last week Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said the Fed had not done enough.    Mr. Regan's comments, which included a suggestion for bringing the Federal Reserve under Administration control, came before Thursday's report that the M-1 measure of the money supply fell a whopping $7.1 billion in the week ended Dec. 3.    Pressure Put on Volcker    Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and an object of Mr. Regan's criticism more than once in the last four years, has acknowledged in recent weeks that inflation was a diminished problem. He is being pushed from all sides to loosen the money supply further."

The 8,800-pound Vega, carrying two television cameras and an array of scientific sensors, was reported to be functioning normally as it headed for the first close encounter with the comet, which has dazzled mankind with its spectacular visits every 76 years.    A Legend and an OmenOne of the more brilliant comets, Halley's is legendary as an omen of ill-fortune and irresistible as an object of scientific curiosity because so little is known about these wanderers from the fringes of the solar system.    Vega 1 is the first of four craft that are to visit the comet in the same month and conduct a comprehensive study of the comet's solid nucleus and surrounding cloud of gas, dust and other material. Vega's sensitive cameras could return the first images of the core of a comet."

But this Christmas, the windows of the stately four-story emporium display a hand-painted ''For Sale'' sign instead of toys and lights. The once- bustling ladies' tea parlor on its mezzanine, overlooking the cream-colored main shopping floor, is empty. Two weeks ago, McCabe's, its sales devastated by layoffs in the farm and construction equipment industries, closed its doors for good.    ''The last three or four years, economic conditions have worsened so much here that we got to the point where it wasn't practical to continue,'' said Robert E.

And ever since the report sailed into view, affected groups, ranging from oil companies and stockbrokers to universities and churches, have been firing away at those parts of the plan that they think would hurt their interests.    Most of the critics say they favor broadening the tax base and cutting marginal tax rates in general but feel a serious mistake was made when it came to eliminating their tax break in particular. If all the missiles aimed at specific parts of the Treasury proposal hit their targets, however, obviously the whole plan will collapse."

The action came as the military Government of President Augusto Pinochet continued to conduct raids in poor neighborhoods of the capital. Troops and police officers arrested at least a dozen men today and rounded up hundreds of others to check identity cards.

The very word implies risk. To be on the margin, the dictionary says, is to be on the edge, or the brink. And for some investors, buying on margin - that is, buying with money borrowed from a broker - often represents being on the brink of disaster. But when used successfully, margin can multiply an investor's profit.  Margin trading has a long if not entirely venerable history in the United States. Its origins are somewhat murky, but the practice is thought to date to early in the last century, when investors were allowed to put up a fraction of the cost of a bank's stock and to borrow the rest from the bank.  Today, margin accounts are proliferating, partly because of the new types of services being pushed by brokerage houses and banks. The new asset-management accounts, for example, are margin accounts. They open up a line of credit for the customer based on the value of cash or securities in the account. Investors use the borrowed funds to buy more securities - most often common stocks - than they could in an outright cash transaction. Why borrow to buy?"

''There is a tremendous amount of nervousness and uncertainty.'' said Gary M. Becker, head of the energy futures group at Paine Webber Inc. in Houston. ''The markets are very much in disarray.''    Some OPEC officials insisted yesterday that the organization would maintain its official prices by cutting production. But most oil analysts continued to say that a price cut was all but inevitable in view of an oversupply of oil and the large amount of discounting that includes unofficial price cuts by various Arab oil exporters."

The officers also suggested that the deployment of Soviet-built radar, which was believed to have arrived recently in Nicaragua, would be defensive if linked with Soviet-made surface- to-air missiles already in Nicaragua.    If the Soviet Union furnished Nicaragua with MIG-21 fighters, the subject of widespread speculation this week, even that would add more to the defensive than to the offensive power of the Nicaraguans, the officers said."
