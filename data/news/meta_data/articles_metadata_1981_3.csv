The Rev. Moon Ik Hwan, a noted theologian and translator of the Bible into Korean, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sedition, began fasting to protest continuing arrests of students in South Korea and what he charges is President Chun's failure to achieve a promised ''national reconciliation,'' the Japan Emergency Christian Conference on Korean Problems, a Protestant group, announced at a news conference here.   ''There is concern that he plans to continue his fast until at least Sept. 22,'' a spokesman for the group said.  ''Even if he ends his fast then, there are fears that his body may not be able to stand it,'' the spokesman said. Dr. Moon is 63 years old and is said to have lost weight rapidly during his three weeks of not eating. The fast is the second this summer by a political prisoner linked to Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's most prominent dissident, to draw attention to grievances of the opposition."

The agreement calls for Cities Service, based in Tulsa, Okla., to buy back the 6.02 million shares held by Nu-West, a Canadian real estate and energy company, for $307 million, or $51 a share. Nu-West paid about $45 a share, or a total of $272 million."

The judges who convicted Mehmed Ali Agca of trying to kill the Pope said that the Turkish terrorist appeared to be the spearhead of a subversive organization but that there was no solid evidence to identify either the promoters of the conspiracy or the motives.   The judges issued their full 51-page opinion tonight three months after they sentenced the assailant to life imprisonment.  ''Agca was only the visible point of a conspiracy which, though impossible to define, was widespread and menacing and devised by shadowy forces which not even the Turkish authorities were able to render intelligible,'' the opinion said."

The ruling, announced here Sept. 1, is the most dramatic example of the Government-sponsored attempt to foster standards of probity and private behavior that are defined as Islamic.

Meanwhile, Government organizations are considering a national standard of dress."

The directive, which replaces one issued in May 1977 by President Carter, means, according to a senior Government official, that the human-rights record of potential customers will be a factor but not ''the sole determinant'' in deciding whether to make the sale. It also apparently signals the end of self-imposed ''unilateral restraint'' on American arms deals in view of the Soviet sales program.   ''We will deal with the world as it is, rather than as we would like it to be,'' said the policy directive, which President Reagan signed yesterday."

Like the earlier two encyclicals - one on the ''moral disorder'' of the arms race and another on the dangers of materialism - ''Laborem Exercens'' (''On Human Work'') is a nuanced document that reveals both the Pope's scholarly background and his pastoral concern for the way the modern world affects the life of the Christian.   The Polish-born Pope's diplomatic tact is also evident in the balanced critique of both capitalism and Marxism. By stressing the theological aspect of work as humanity's ''specific dignity,'' he gives a spiritual dimension to labor at a time when economic and technological developments tend to downgrade the worker, making him merely a unit of production or operator of machinery."

The decline and slower activity, analysts said, were partly attributable the wait-and-see stance of institutional investors in the face of uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates and the shape of the tax bill being debated in Congress. Also, a trading halt in two key takeover-related shares dampened activity somewhat.   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.09, to 948.25. The current level is not very far above the low for this year of 931.57 and well below below the 1981 high of 1024.05."

The Socialist majority in Parliament virtually assures the law's passage. However, the Council of State, which advises the Government on the constitutionality of proposed laws, could reject it on constitutional grounds. The council is made up of 23 elder statesmen, most of them hold-overs from the center and right governments of the past 23 years.

According to many analysts, the near-record interest rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market is the main obstacle to lower interest rates in all maturities. In the absence of the long-awaited drop in the funds rate, and because of a heavy supply of new issues, most interest rates have been rising since mid-June.   In the long-term bond market, for example, the bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due 2011 were offered late in the day at 102 7/8 to yield 13.47 percent, compared with 12.55 percent on June 15."

Its archrival, the Digital Equipment Corporation of Maynard, Mass., had already introduced such a machine - a super minicomputer -forcing Data General to embark on a crash program in 1979 to design a powerful new mini of its own.   A book, ''The Soul of a New Machine,'' by Tracy Kidder, tells the story of two engineering teams of youthful computer designers - the Microkids and the Hardy Boys - who worked under high stress days, nights and weekends on what the company called project Eagle.   Mr. Kidder was there and his book recounts the pressures, the motivations, the corporate gamesmanship and the formidable technical problems. The project, under Tom West, a tough and individualistic manager, was a free-wheeling, risk-taking cell in the bowels of a structured corporation. ''Data General comes across as one of the few places people coming straight out of college can get in and contribute to a major project,'' said Edson D. De Castro, president and a founder of Data General. ''Of course, there is the other side of the coin. Did the company exploit them? But I think Kidder shows that for the engineers, involvement was a personally satisfying experience.''"

''By itself the money number does not change anything, but it is part of a trend that, if continued for another half month, would set the stage for lower rates,'' said Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber Inc.   William Melton, an economist at the Irving Trust Company, added that the Fed would ''continue to be very cautious'' about encouraging lower rates by making bank reserves more plentiful. Although growth of the adjusted M-1B money supply measure is about $8 billion below the Fed's target of 3 1/2 percent growth this year, growth of M-2, the other closely watched money-supply measure, has been very rapid.  Mr. Melton estimated that M-2 would increase at a 12 or 13 percent annual rate in July, which would put it above the top 9 percent growth rate that the Fed has targeted for 1981."

Central Committee Stanislaw Kania and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers Wojciech Jaruzelski received the Soviet Amabassador Boris Aristov, who on behalf of the supreme party and state authorities of the Soviet Union stated the following:   The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government are compelled to draw the attention of the Central Committee of the P.U.W.P . and of the Polish Government to thegrowing of an ti-Sovietism in Poland and to such an intensification ofit which has reached dangerous limits.   Facts indicate that an acute and unchecked campaign is being waged openly, widely and with impunity in the country against the Soviet Union, its foreign and home policies and that it amounts not to sporadic irresponsible hooligan excesses but to coordinated actions by the enemies of socialism of a clearly defined political line. Its main objective is to vilify and cast aspersions on the world's first socialist state and on the very idea of socialism, to enkindle among Poles hostility and hatred of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, to break the bonds of the brotherly friendship linking our nations and as a result to wrest Poland out of the socialist commonwealth and to liquidate socialism in Poland herself."

With nearly half of the vote counted, and on the basis of sample precincts, Israeli television predicted that Mr. Begin's Likud bloc and the opposition Labor Party of Shimon Peres would each win 48 or 49 seats in the 120-member Parliament, with a slight edge for Labor.   Of the votes counted 10 hours after the polls closed, Labor had won 38.3 percent and the Likud 35.8.  But the smaller parties on the left, whose support Labor would need to form a majority coalition, were doing very poorly and were expected to win no more than two or three seats among them. The religious and right-wing parties, potential allies of the Likud, were making a stronger showing, with up to 15 seats predicted for them altogether."

''We can sa y with assuredness there will be a plus before the percentage fi gure,'' he said. He indicated that growth after inflation wou ld be about 1 percent, adding that ''only at the year's end, knowing the actual inflation figure, will we know the real growth rate.'

The approval of the President's tax program yesterday by the House and the Senate will translate into a tax cut that will amount to $150 billion in three years, by far the biggest tax cut in the nation's history.   That tax cut follows actions by a Senate-House conference committee that will reduce the Government's public expenditures by $36 billion next year and, according to President Reagan, by a cumulative total of $140 billion over the next three years, which Mr. Reagan called ''the most sweeping cutbacks in the history of the budget.''   The tax and budget cuts certainly represent the most striking change of direction since the New Deal in the balance between the public and private sectors of the American economy.

Harry Holiday, chief executive of Armco, said in a telephone interview that studies by the company had concluded that even after new pipe mills announced by Armco and other steel producers were ready, the domestic capacity to produce pipe would total about 3.1 million tons by 1986. But projected demand would be about 5.3 million tons, leaving a shortfall of more than two million tons that presumably would be made up by imports.   Mr. Holiday said in a news conference in Houston yesterday that by the end of 1984 Armco, the nation's sixth-largest steel company, planned to spend $290 million to build a new mill to produce steel blooms at its works in Ashland, Ky., and $343 million to build a finishing mill in Gulfport, Miss.

But with more and more women pursuing careers, estate planners have turned their sights on two-income couples. While such couples are in many ways better off from an estate-planning standpoint, they, too, have tax problems.   The topic is the subject of an article in the current issue of The Estates, Gifts and Trusts Journal, a publication for tax professionals. The author of the article, Carlie B. Sorensen, a Washington tax lawyer, concludes that while two-income couples are in an ''optimum position'' so far as estate and gift planning are concerned, their advantages can be easily lost if they pool their assets by keeping joint bank accounts and fail to maintain accurate records of their separate incomes and investments during their marriage."

It is expected that the duration of the new loans will be six to nine months, at interest rates as low as 14 percent.   The longer-term loans are for all financial institutions - including savings and loans, mutual banks and credit unions - suffering a liquidity problem caused by the withdrawal of deposits.  Although commercial banks will have access to the new facility, the program is to be chiefly of benefit to the thrift institutions, because they have been losing deposits as a result of high interest rates."

Shipping industry officials say little is known about Mr. Shear's ''maritime philosophy,'' but it is widely believed that he was appointed by the Reagan Administration because of its desire to foster closer coordination between the shipping industry and the nation's overall defense planning."

But the White House deliberately refrained from staging a warm official embrace.

VOTES TO ISOLATE SOUTH AFRICA OVER NAMIBIA,"  The General Assembly today voted overwhelmingly, 117 to 0 with 25 abstentions, to isolate South Africa and to arm the guerrillas fighting to make South-West Africa the independent nation of Namibia.   The stern resolution has no binding force, however, and most diplomats here saw it as an expression of African frustration over South Africa's refusal to yield Namibia.   The United States was among the large group of Western and other democracies that abstained, largely on the ground that the document would make South Africa more rather than less intractable. With Britain, France, Canada and West Germany, the United States has been trying to persuade South Africa to accept a plan for elections in the territory that would be supervised by the United Nations."

INFLATION,"  In just two weeks and a day, the much-heralded cuts in income tax rates begin. Tax advisers caution, however, that people should not expect to see big reductions in their tax bills after the cuts are phased in from Oct. 1, 1981, to July 1, 1983. ''We're not really cutting taxes for most people - we're simply preventing their taxes from going higher,'' said Leon M. Nad, a partner at the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse & Company.   Although tax rates are being reduced, he noted, inflation will push most salaries higher. For most people, therefore, the tax cuts will simply offset the extra taxes they would have had to pay on higher wages. ''If you continued to earn the same amount of taxable income, you would see an actual tax saving,'' Mr. Nad said. Schedule of 3 Reductions   The new law reduces tax rates on individual income by 5 percent on Oct. 1, by 10 percent on July 1, 1982, and by 10 percent again on July 1, 1983. The law also shrinks the maximum tax on individual income to 50 percent on Jan. 1, 1982, from the current ceiling of 70 percent. There is already a 50 percent ceiling on earned income (such as wages, salaries, pensions and bonuses) but not on unearned income (such as interest, dividends and rent)."

Over the last year, however, three major corporations - the H.J.  Heinz Company, Inco Ltd. and the Xerox Corporation - have taken a different approach. They have begun ''indexing'' pension benefits to inflation. The mechanics differ somewhat as do the indexed increases, but all three have the same goal: to protect retirees from most of the devastating effects of inflation by providing supplemental pension payments. Yet such inflation protection does not come without a cost to the employees."

It seems clear at first from the accompanying chart that the yield advantage of bonds over stocks is greater than at any time over the past generation. Had we extended the chart back further in time, we would have seen that stocks actually yielded more than bonds for the 30 preceding years. In fact, the gap between bond and stock yields, as well as the absolute level of bond yields, is at its highest. Some analysts are therefore calling corporate bonds - with their yields in the vicinity of 15 percent - the buys of the century and the best thing available to the public since night baseball (before the strike).   It may well be that bonds are a most attractive investment medium today and that congenital bond market pessimists will finally be proved wrong.

On a recent day, the slender, 49-year-old laborer strode assertively to a control panel and pushed a fat maroon button. A rolling line of metallic saucers, destined for a spot in every new front-wheel-drive car produced by the General Motors Corporation, jerked to a halt.   ''I could never do this before,'' said Mrs. Brantley, one of 2,500 Buick workers who has been trained in what are termed ''Quality of Work Life'' principles. ''Now, I stop the line whenever there is a problem.''"

But it has been 50 years since ''Boss'' Hoover's salesmen slept in giant canvas tents and serenaded the chairman's livestock. And although Hoover now sells almost as many vacuum cleaners in the United States as all its competitors combined, a saturated domestic market, large foreign losses and a costly restructuring of its European operations have left company officials with little to sing about.   The retrenching in Europe is intended to reduce Hoover's long reliance on Britain as its chief market outside the United States and its European manufacturing and distribution center. The work force at three plants in Britain has been cut to 9,000 from 13,000, export headquarters have been moved from Britain to corporate headquarters in North Canton, Ohio, and a $10 million expansion is under way at Hoover's plant in Dijon, France."

A serviceable but somewhat costly bridge is available to the home buyer who has substantial capital though not enough to hold mortgage payments down to an affordable level.   Make these assumptions: The individual is willing to invade principal to cover current mortgage payments, and future income prospects are bright enough that in a few years the mortgage payments can be paid from current income.   A financial adviser, who asked not to be identified, recalls how he handled such a situation.  His client, a young woman in business, had purchased a co-op apartment. She soon discovered that the high mortgage payments left her short. Although her income was rising, it would be several years before income matched her needs.

The two events, obviously related, underscore Pakistan's sensitivity that as the arms supply relationship with the United States is being resumed, India is stepping up bellicose language aimed at its western neighbor. ''There seems to have been a progressive erosion of restraints,'' commented Abdus Sattar, the Pakistani Ambassador here, as he discussed what he regards as the unwarranted fomenting of a war psychosis.   In Islamabad, Mr. Sattar's superiors insist that while they have made every effort to inform India of their defense needs and wishes, the Indian Government has merely brushed aside these gestures and criticized the purchase of F-16 fighter aircraft from the United States as representing a real menace to India and touching off a costly arms race on the subcontinent."

Such regulatory legislation as the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act were sometimes referred to within the profession as ''acountants' full-employment acts.'' These laws and others increased the need of corporations for financial reporting, auditing and other accounting services.   The Reagan Administration is intent upon peeling away as many of the regulatory controls on business as possible. For instance, Administration officials want the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to be stricken entirely. They argue that the legislation saddles American companies engaged in international trade with unnecessary costs."

In the Treasury bill market, rates on new bills moved higher at yesterday's auction, where three-month bills averaged 15.56 percent, up from 14.56 percent last week, and six-month bills averaged 15.32 percent, up from 14.23 percent.   After adding one-quarter percentage point to the six-month bill average, banks may pay a top rate of 15.57 percent for new six-month savings certificates starting today, up from 14.48 percent last week.    Although many economists continue to recommend bond purchases because current yields are so high compared with inflation, few investors heeded that advice yesterday. The combination of extremely volatile bond prices, and short-term interest rates that offer higher yields without the risk of a steep price decline, have kept many investors from moving funds into longer maturities."

Out the broad window, looking north, the view is Manhattan, then Connecticut, and in a real sense, the entire globe.   Clifton C. Garvin Jr., the 14th chief executive of the Exxon Corporation, is eating a cheeseburger (without bun), and talking about Exxon's place in the world's economic firmament and the nuances of the giant company's conception of the economics, politics, and sociology of our collective energy future.   ''You know, I'm the last guy to be opposed to something because of size,'' Mr. Garvin, 59, said with a laugh in the course of a rambling two-hour conversation."

Bidder announces a tender offer for the shares of Target, offering 150 percent or more than the current market price. The management of Target promptly announces that the price is inadequate, that Bidder does not appreciate the time-honored ways in which Target does business, that the market does not appreciate how soon Target's profits will skyrocket if management is just left to do its job. Bidder, the management says, would spoil all this, and shareholders who take the offer are foolish.   Lest the foolishness of shareholders overcome them, Target's management sets out to protect them from themselves. Target files suit against Bidder, asking a court to block the offer on any available grounds - frequently that Bidder has not disclosed to shareholders the very things Target's management announces for all to hear. Target may acquire a competitor of Bidder, seeking to create an antitrust impediment to the offer, or perhaps Target issues new shares, buys back existing ones, or does something else to complicate Bidder's life."

The office of William Wilson, the United States envoy to the Vatican, said yesterday that it had asked the Italian Government ''to take appropriate action'' regarding the article published by the Soviet Embassy. Mr. Wilson's office said the article ''implicates by innuendo'' the American Government and its envoy in the May 13 attack on the Pope.   A spokesman for the Vatican today refused to comment on the incident, but Vatican and diplomatic sources said the office of Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, the Vatican Secretary of State, was informed before the protest on Friday and agreed with the American action.

Wall Street economists said they were particularly hopeful for favorable developments in short-term maturities - and for a decline soon in the prime lending rate of 20 1/2 percent -while long-term bonds still face the problems of a bulging Federal deficit.   Hopes for improvement on the short-term front were buoyed by two developments last Friday. The Federal funds rate, for overnight loans between banks, sank to 14 1/2 percent during the day.

The official's wife asked if he would like to see her chickens, and then led him outside. There in the back garden were 300 broilers being fattened for the Lusaka market.

All over the developing world, the production and consumption of meat are soaring. In the last five years, for example, the per capita consumption of poultry has risen by 24 percent in the developing countries. Poultry Part of Meat Category   The meat category, as defined by experts, includes poultry in addition to beef, veal, pork and sheep, goat and horse meats.  The trend is the most important change in global eating habits of the last decade, in the view of many food experts. Despite warnings in the early 1970's that the world's food-producing capacity could not sustain an American-style diet, people in Africa and the Middle East, in the rapidly growing countries of Southeast Asia and in Eastern Europe, Mexico and Brazil are using their rising incomes to purchase more meat."

Such standard restrictions include what are called ''third-country exclusions'' that prevent a buyer of American military equipment from transferring the equipment or technological secrets about it to another country without permission from the United States.   Another standard part of all foreign military sales agreements is a pledge to maintain the security o f secret and sensitive equipment.  Safeguards against use of the planes, known as Awacs, against Israel in a f uture Arab-Israeli conflict are expected to figure prominently i n Congressional debate over the proposed $8.5 billion sale of air c ombat equipment."

On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 11.13 points, to 824.01, its lowest level since the recession in the spring of 1980, and the American Stock Exchange's key index suffered its second-largest decline on record.   Prices fell quickly when the market opened, reflecting concern that President Reagan's proposals Thursday night will fail to keep the Federal budget deficit within bounds. The markets also reacted to a new forecast from Joseph Granville, a well-known investment adviser whose sometimes dramatic predictions have affected stock prices in the past. Predicts Big Drop Monday   Mr. Granville said in an interview in Paris that stock prices would plunge in New York on Monday.  In the credit markets, the return on long-term Government bonds rose to a record level, exceeding 15 percent, as prices, which move inversely to yields, plunged. Short-term interest rates rose, too.

Two commentaries in the official press were devoted to the subject today, one of them making a mocking reference to the Reagan letter.  The commentaries, by the Communist party newspaper Pravda and by the Government's press agency Tass, said American appeals on Poland were a mask for a policy that sought to generate tension by funding and otherwise manipulating the ''counterrevolutionary'' activities of Solidarity, Poland's independent labor union."

At the same time, imports fell as businesses reduced their supplies of raw materials from abroad and drew down stocks."

The ministers noted that there have been extensive discussions with interested African governments and the Organization of African Unity. The ministers also noted that discussions had taken place between the United States Government and the South African Government and that there had been a recent exchange of messages between the Five and South Africa. It is therefore now possible to identify more clearly the issues involved and a process for their resolution which would lead to implementation of Security Council Resolution 435."

So far, only one family has found the courage to construct a shelter of tar paper and plastic along the one-mile stretch. The rest of the thousands who are coming back are camping in the open with the pots and pans and cloth they were able to rescue in the raid, an attempt by the authorities to force them out of the street.   Some of the returned sidewalk dwellers are sleeping in train stations or with friends whose huts were saved from demolition by a last-minute court order. But in the daytime they come back to occupy the few square feet of pavement that for many had been their home for as long as 25 years.

In contrast, Washington has carefully avoided singling out the South Africans and has said violence in the region has to be seen ''in its full context.''"

He signed an agreement to that effect before leaving the military airfield at Evreux, near Paris, where his plane landed at 4:30 A.M. today."

Mr. Timerman said that the reports seemed to distort his account and constituted a trial of his case by the press.   In one of the tapes, Mr. Timerman can be heard saying that he expected his arrest because of his connections with David Graiver, an Argentine banker alleged to have been the money manager of a group of leftist guerrillas called the Montoneros.   Mr. Timerman said yesterday in a telephone interview from his home in Tel Aviv that he did not believe his arrest had anything to do with his relationship with Mr. Graiver.   In his book, ''Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number,'' Mr. Timerman states that he was arrested in April 1977 because his newspaper, La Opinion, had been publishing the names of people who had disappeared and were evidently being held and killed by units of the military. The book, published two months ago, also portrays some of his captors as anti-Semitic. Mr. Timerman stated in his book that he believed that one of the reasons he was tortured after his arrest was that he is Jewish."

Philip R. Brinkerhoff, the mortgage corporation's president, said the aim was to convert $2 billion of such mortgages this year and up to $20 billion by the end of 1982, thereby providing an important source of liquidity for beleaguered savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks.   Mr. Brinkerhoff said the program had already been put into effect on a test basis and will be operating full scale by next month.   The savings banks and savings and loans, collectively known as thrifts, hold some $600 billion of mortgages, the bulk of the $800 billion mortgage debt outstanding. More than 90 percent of the total mortgage debt was written to yield 12 1/2 percent or less, compared with current interest rates of about 17 percent that thrifts must pay to acquire funds."

The fact occasions surprise, since his voice has not been trailing off in South Africa. A well-turned Paton polemic, mixing moral reflection and salty advice to white politicians and others who seem ill disposed to heed it, is still apt to show up in the local press, injecting a little incandescence into gray columns of ritualistic debate.   Now, after a hiatus of 28 years, the author of ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' is waiting with all the anxiety and hopes of a literary unknown for the publication of his first novel since ''Too Late the Phalarope.'' There were seven books after that - including ''Towards the Mountain,'' the first volume of an autobiography published last year - but it seemed likely that his second novel, written at the age of 50, would be his last. He had even ceased to be thought of as a practicing novelist, but Mr. Paton is now inclined to think that his third novel, due in September, could prove to be the first in a trilogy."

The frenetic contest in the House of Representatives dramatized the importance of the tax bill, but the Reagan fiscal victory had already been secured no matter whose bill won. For the Democratic bill, had it passed, would have given the President almost everything he wanted.   Mr. Reagan was certainly right in asserting that he had made converts, if grudging ones, of virtually all the Democrats. In the final hours of the debate, the President reminded them that when he first proposed his heavy tax cuts during the campaign and immediately after the election, the Democrats said tax-cutting was out of the question because it would be ''wildly inflationary.''"

This would be a drastic change from the current law, called the business judgment rule, which requires the directors of a target company to evaluate the offer in good faith and determine whether it is in the best interest of the company's shareholders. Such a suggestion strikes me as very unwise and very undesirable.

William Whitelaw, the Home Secretary, said in the House of Commons that Michael Heseltine, the Environment Secretary and temporary Minister for Inner Cities, would go to Liverpool's Toxteth district Monday with other senior officials to lead a new inquiry into ways of solving the problems of that area and other troubled inner cities.   Mr. Whitelaw also said in the packed House of Commons that inquiries would be held on a police raid in the Brixton area of London last night that led to renewed disturbances and into injuries caused by the police use of tear gas in Toxteth.   The actions, announced during a tumultuous debate in the House of Commons, fell far short of widespread demands for new programs aimed at inner city problems, and reflected Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's determination to avoid changing her economic program."

They are pouring money into American basic research, and, industry executives say, they are watching the new little companies that have sprung up in genetic research with an eye toward possible acquisitions.   In May, Hoechst, West Germany's and the world's second-biggest chemical group, after BASF, also of West Germany, said it was giving the Massachusetts General Hospital, which is affiliated with the Harvard Medical School, a 10-year, $50 million grant for research in molecular biology in exchange for a claim to patents and licenses for applications.   Last October, Bayer, No.3 worldwide, gave the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a five-year, $300,000 gift for a professorship in biotechnology. Unlike Hoechst, Bayer said it had no formal agreement for the transfer of results, but the endowment is expected to give Bayer some benefit from M.I.T.'s research."

The principal contenders are Denis Healey, the present deputy leader and a moderate former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Tony Benn, a former peer and former Cabinet member who has emerged as the leader of party elements that favor unilateral nuclear disarmament, the restriction or closure of American bases in Britain, the abolition of the House of Lords and a sweeping program of further nationalization.   A third candidate, John Silkin, appears to have failed in his bid to present himself as a unifier between two extreme points of view.  The contest has been going on for months and has so preoccupied the party that it has failed to capitalize on the unpopularity of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government. Michael Foot, the Labor leader, has said the contentiousness that the contest symbolizes threatens to destroy the party, which has won five of the 11 elections held in Britain since World War II."

The net deposit withdrawals from the 4,700 savings and loan associations totaled $5.3 billion in the first four months of this year. Savers drew down their deposits by $4.2 billion from the 460 mutual savings banks over the same period. Meanwhile, the combined operating losses of the savings and loan associations and savings banks, which together make up what is known as the thrift industry, already exceed $1 billion so far this year.   When a major company or an important industry runs into such difficulty, it often seeks aid from the Federal Government. The Reagan Administration, after a bitter internal debate, recently agreed to help the loss-ridden domestic automobile industry with protection against Japanese imports. The Carter Administration agreed to help the Chrysler Corporation with emergency loan guarantees not unlike the ones adopted under President Nixon to aid the Lockheed Corporation.

This time, instead of invading American consumer markets with their Toyotas, Sonys and Panasonics, the Japanese are bringing their money. In increasing numbers, they are coming to buy stocks on Wall Street and to wheel and deal in America's commodities pits.   For decades Japanese authorities, concerned with sheltering its economy, severely restricted the ability of Japanese to take yen out of the country. Last December, however, those stringent foreign exchange controls were substantially relaxed, and more Japanese funds are already flowing into American stock and commodity markets.   Though the total is not yet great, investment professionals in both Japan and the United States predict far-reaching effects in both countries, not only in investment circles but also in broader economic, political and diplomatic spheres. The influx of Japanese funds is not only more business for Wall Street; it is also expected to enlarge, deepen and add liquidity to American financial markets.  And in international finance, Japan's relaxing of currency controls is a kind of coming of age, elevating the yen as a major world currency and signifying Japan's willingness to expose its economy to the vagaries of world currency markets."

He appealed to the nation's youth not to be duped by religious fanatics, and said that he would no longer tolerate lax discipline in Egypt.

The blue-chip barometer closed off 2.57 points, to 899.26. The last time the Dow has closed below 900 was on July 11, 1980, when it finished at 891.l3.   The Dow fell 16.36 points last week and has dropped about 46 points since Aug.1, mainly, analysts say, because of apprehension over rising interest rates. High interest rates attract funds to competing forms of investment, such as money market funds, which offer high yields and low risk; raise concern about the health of business, thereby discouraging investment in stocks, and make it too costly for many investors to buy stocks on margin."

REAGAN'S POSSE,"  WASHINGTON THE Reagan Cabinet's steer-roping ace doesn't much like to toot his own horn: Cowboys regard a man for what he is and what he can do, not for what he says. Their world is far from Washington, where Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige says wryly everyone would be a billionaire if people were paid by the word.   But Mr. Baldrige, a card-carrying member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association - he still wins money as a ''heeler,'' the man in team roping who lassos the steer's hind legs - is the Administration's quietly influential Marlboro man. An outdoorsman in a workaholic's city, he would rather close his day in the saddle than behind a mound of paperwork. In the present Administration that bestows a special advantage. Often his fellow rider is Ronald Reagan.    But the plain-spoken Mr. Baldrige, who built Scovill Inc. into a $1 billion multinational enterprise, is playing an important role in the Reagan Administration and enunciating policy in an increasingly influential way. There are even those who say that under him, the Commerce Department, traditionally the weak sister of the Washington bureaucracy, is becoming a power base with at least the potential of becoming a real force in the Capital. Political analysts in Washington suspect that Mr. Baldrige may be building a power base to challenge Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican Senator of Connecticut, in the 1982 elections."

The gross national product, the value of the nation's goods and services, is now calculated to have declined during the April-June period at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, adjusted for inflation, a somewhat faster pace than the 1.9 percent decline initially reported four weeks ago.   Profits after taxes fell 11.3 percent, in part because of high interest rates, the report said.  The new G.N.P. figure compared with an 8.6 percent rate of gain in the first quarter - a figure reached after two upward revisions."

''The provisions in the Taiwan Relations Act, which interfere in the internal affairs of China, can only encourage Taiwanese authorities to reject peaceful talks and oppose peaceful unification,'' said the article, which was approved for publication by senior officials.

Leading economic forecasters predict that America's gross national product, the basic measure of the nation's output of goods and services, will register either a slight increase or only a modest decline for the three-month period of July, August and September.

Mr. Regan, as a former chairman of Merrill Lynch, clearly feels that he possesses the hard-earned right to show proper disrespect for the wisdom of Wall Street.

If the deficit of $42.5 billion forecast by the Reagan team for the year turns out to be substantially larger, investors fear that it could unleash a wave of inflation and high interest rates. Their concern that even the second round of budget cutting now being undertaken by the President will not bring the deficit much within $60 billion has been enough to send the financial markets into a tailspin.   But other people argue that the size of the deficit - whether it is $42.5 billion, $50 billion or $60 billion - will have no bearing on the success or failure of the Reagan program. At worst, they say, deficits have marginal influence in determining levels of interest and inflation, and at best they can be a stimulant to a sagging economy."

One is an easing of the marriage penalty. Another is a provision that could greatly aid many two-income households with children, but is still virtually unknown outside a tight coterie of tax experts.   That provision would permit companies to set up tax-favored ''dependent-care assistance programs'' to help pay for employee child-care expenses, a much sought-after fringe benefit now that more and more mothers are working. Effective Jan. 1, 1982, companies can set up and pay for the costs of on-site day-care centers, directly pay the outside providers of such services, or reimburse employees for the costs of home day care provided by housekeepers and babysitters.   Within certain limits, employees will not have to report the reimbursement as taxable income, just as they now do not have to report medical reimbursements. In addition, companies will be able to claim a tax deduction for their share of the bill, so long as the program is a formal written plan and is not limited to highly paid workers."

On Aug. 15, 1971, President Nixon acted to defend the dollar, then flooding the world in everincreasing volume, by imposing a 10 percent surcharge on imports, suspending the convertibility of the dollar into American gold by foreign central banks and instituting wage and price controls to combat domestic inflation.   By Dec. 18, 1971, the resultant upheaval caused a realignment of currency values that ended the system of fixed exchange rates set at the Bretton Woods, N.H., meeting in 1944. The dollar, no longer backed by gold, was, in effect, cut loose to rise or fall in the marketplace, protected only by periodic central bank interventions."

Haig Jr. to the General Assembly of the United Nations, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of ABC News:   International development reflects the worldwide search for economic progress, social justice and human dignity. Short of war itself, no other issue before us will affect more people, for good or ill, than this search.   We must choose today between two futures: a future of sustainable growth, an expansion of world trade, and a reduction of poverty - or a future of economic stagnation, rising protectionism, and the spread of poverty.   The poorest developing countries require long-term and generous concessional aid from developed and other developing countries to raise productivity, to broadly based education and training, improvements in health, nutrition, and better infrastructure."

Talley make much of the fact that nonfinancial corporations last year paid taxes on some $62 billion of ''phantom profits'' - the amount of Commerce Department adjustments for underdepreciation and inventory gains. They fail to mention that this sector excluded from its taxable income some $56 billion in net interest payments, most of which is a phantom expense.   This is a curious omission for two bank economists to make. Surely they can appreciate that when their employer, the Mellon Bank, lends out money at 20 percent and the inflation rate is 10 percent, the bank's real earnings on the transaction make up only half of the interest payments it receives. The remainder is not real income, because it merely compensates the bank for the declining value of principal; reckoned in constant dollars, it is return of capital.  Without the cover of inflation, it would not be a tax-deductible expense to the borrower."

Spaniards have had the occasion to pose this and a few other unsettling what-ifs and might-have-beens of history after a summer of pretrial newspaper leaks of the testimony of soldiers involved in the unsuccessful coup in February.   But the disclosures, started by defense attorneys for some of the 32 officers accused in the plot, appear to have backfired. Instead of high-minded patriots, the defendants emerge from their pretrial depositions as incompetent and undecided plotters, unwilling finally to assume responsibility for their botched enterprise.   And, with their court-martial nearing, the principal defendants have been unable to marshal any proof for their contention that King Juan Carlos was somehow involved in the plot. The testimony makes it clear that the King was surprised by the rebellion and had a major hand in stopping it."

The riots in Liverpool this week, stemming partly from the worst unemployment Britain has experienced since the Depression of the 1930's, are grim evidence of the failure of what was once regarded as a brilliant innovation in economic policy.   When Mrs. Thatcher became Prime Minister in May 1979, she was the darling of conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. Today, she faces a revolt in her own party and has been disowned by the Reaganites in Washington, who say she departed from and made a mess of what initially was a correct solution to the twin problems of inflation and industrial stagnation.   But was her fault one of execution or were there inherent inconsistencies and contradictions in the Thatcher program that the Reagan Administration is on the way to repeating?"

Thus far the White House is talking about relatively small trims, amounting at most to $15 billion in each of the next three years. If fully carried out, those trims would still permit the Pentagon's budget to rise by $15 billion in 1982, $25 billion in 1983 and $42 billion in 1984.

In the bond market, investor demand continues to be very weak, even though there was enough buying at yesterday's near record low prices to raise prices slightly by the end of the day. Many analysts continue to expect that tax cuts and defense spending later this year will fuel inflation and credit demands, and therefore keep bond yields from declining.   The high interest rates available in the money markets, where 18 percent returns are common for issues due in a few months or less, is another reason for scant investor demand for long-term bonds."

The warning was contained in an open letter to Mr. Trudeau that urged him to accelerate the policy set down last October that would reduce ownership by foreign interests of oil and gas production in Canada from about 70 percent to at least 50 percent by 1990.

And in requesting additional information from the Mobil Corporation on the competitive implications of a Mobil takeover of Conoco, the antitrust division is responding to expressions of concern by a number of legislators over the concentration of corporate ownership."

That question lies at the heart of a court battle between Johnson & Johnson and three inventors from Minnesota who sold their young company and its electronic pain reliever to the health care giant seven years ago.   Last July a Federal jury in Minneapolis ruled that Johnson & Johnson had fraudulently bought the electronic painkilling product in order to quietly suppress the device and head off new competition for its drug business. The court ordered the New Brunswick, N.J., company to pay $170.4 million in damages and antitrust fines. According to Judge Miles Lord of the United States District Court in Minneapolis, the evidence before the jury indicated that Johnson & Johnson had engaged in fraud of ''the most extreme and culpable nature.''"

Haig Jr. to the Foreign Policy Association at the New York Hilton Hotel:   Following are excerpts from a speech yesterday by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. to the Foreign Policy Association at the New York Hilton Hotel   Arms control can be only one element in a comprehensive structure of defense and foreign policy designed to reduce the risks of war. It cannot be the political centerpiece or the crucial barometer of U.S.-Soviet relationships, burdening arms control with a crushing political weight. It can hardly address such issues as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war, the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, the Libyan invasion of Chad or the Cuban intervention in Africa and Latin America.   Our first principle is that our arms control efforts will be an instrument of, not a replacement for, a coherent allied security policy.   There is little prospect of agreements with the Soviet Union that will help solve such a basic security problem as the vulnerability of our land-based missiles until we demonstrate that we have the will and capacity to solve them without arms control, should that be necessary."

Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama's military high command has moved quickly to fill the political vacuum left by the death of the strongman who had ruled the country 13 years.   Although Aristides Royo has been confirmed in his largely administrative role as President, the 10 senior officers of the National Guard, the country's only armed force, have begun to project themselves as the ultimate political authority here.   In recent days, the new commander of the 9,000-member guard, Col.  Florencio Florez Aguilar, a little-known figure until General Torrijos's death in a plane crash July 31, has made several muchpublicized trips around the country, but he is believed to have little ambition to dominate the political scene and has been coordinating closely with the nine lieutenant colonels who comprise the guard's general staff.   Significantly, by inviting proponents and critics of a $2 billion copper development project to argue their case before them last week, the general staff officers assumed responsibility for deciding perhaps the most nettlesome political issue facing the country today. In the meantime, they named the chief of staff, Lieut. Col. Ruben Dario Paredes, to study the project."

Peter Wolf, a consultant on land planning and land-asset management, estimates that over the past five years well-situated raw land of all types in America increased in value by 8 percent to 12 percent a year, or just ahead of inflation.   This is a good record, but as Mr. Wolf writes in a new book, ''Land in America,'' it is hardly enough to justify enthusiastic land speculation. Indeed, Mr. Wolf, whose firm is Peter Wolf Associates in New York City, believes that purchasing unimproved land may be one of the worst things an investor could do today. In his view, most people in this country have no idea how risky the purchase of undeveloped land has become."

After a month of intracoalition bickering over a new budget and over how the cou ntry should deal with the eco nomic stagnation that last month produced the highest unemployment figures in 29 years, theargument took on a new shrillness over the we ekend.

Weidenbaum, has changed his description of the American economy from ''soggy'' to ''spongy.'' Half a year ago, Mr. Weidenbaum was presumably calling the economy ''soggy'' in the sense defined by The American Dollar Dictionary, published in 1949, as ''damp and heavy'' or as ''thoroughly wet'' (the Federal Reserve having excessively liquified the system).   It seems unlikely that he was using ''soggy'' in its secondary sense of ''dull and stupid,'' a meaning he might have applied to the Carter Administration but surely not to his own, despite his differences with other Reaganite economic advisers.   However, far from exhibiting sogginess, the economy in the first quarter showed remarkable springiness. Real gross national product climbed at an annual rate of 8.6 percent. So the economy is regarded by Mr. Weidenbaum as no longer resembling a wet bog but a springy sponge, which you can temporarily depress but which will bounce back as soon as you take off the pressure."

The protest, which was believed to be the first strike affecting civil aviation in the Soviet bloc, caused a cancellation by the airline, LOT, of eight domestic flights and delays or cancellations of 14 international flights, according to organizers of the strike.   The action, coming after a one-hour walkout by 40,000 dock workers yesterday, raised fears that labor unrest might be starting up again, at a time when the Communist Party is preparing for an emergency congress next week to consider changes in the party's statutes, leadership and policies. 3 Dissidents Ordered Rearrested   In another development, the Supreme Court ordered the rearrest of three anti-Communist dissidents who are being tried on charges of plotting violent overthrow of the country's constitutional system.  The three, along with a fourth man, also on trial but at liberty because of ill health, belong to a right-wing organization called the Confederation of Independent Poland."

Early in the day the Treasury announced the postponement of the regular three-month and six-month Treasury bills auction, and said the sale of 20-year bonds tomorrow and one-year bills on Thursday might also be postponed if Congress does not increase the debt ceiling.   The bellwether issue in the long-term bond market, the 13 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due 2011, traded as low as 90 5/8 when prices were declining early in the day, but then rallied to 92 3/4 by the close.

For a decade now, the international financial order has evolved a system that largely leaves the price of yen, marks, francs, pounds, guilders, lire, pesos and cruzeiros to the ebb and flow of supply and demand. In many quarters, of course, this system is still heartily applauded; but increasingly there are calls for reconsideration and for a return to what in any other market would be known as price controls.   In the market for national currencies, those controls were known as fixed exchange rates, which set and sustained the ratios at which one currency was exchanged for another. For a quarter century, fixed rates were the norm of the postwar world. Then, on an August Sunday evening 10 years ago yesterday, Richard Nixon snapped the link between gold and the dollar's value, shattering the rock on which fixed rates rested and, in effect, forcing a reliance on the free market to set the price of currencies.   Now, an increasing number of experts are calling for a reexamination of that system. A great many espouse a return, to some degree or another, to the old system of controls."

Muammar el-Qaddafi set the rules.   The possibility of an air clash, such as the one that occurred yesterday with the reported downing of two Libyan fighters, was not regarded as inevitable, nor was it considered out of the question, several officials said. But they said that because President Carter refused to allow American planes to fly over the Gulf of Sidra during similar exercises last year, there was considerable pressure from the Navy not to allow a precedent to be set.   In 1973 Colonel Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, established a line across the mouth of the Gulf of Sidra as a ''base line,'' south of which Libya claimed as its internal waters. The American officials said that almost yearly since then, American planes and warships had crossed that line. But last year, because of the crisis over the American hostages in Iran, and because of a desire not to cause unnecessary agitation in the region, Mr. Carter did not permit American air or naval craft to go farther south than three miles north of the line."

Richard T. Pratt, chairman of the bank board, which regulates savings and loan associations, pressed for the change in a letter dated July 10 to Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman.   Mr. Pratt wrote that the existing requirement that the savings and loan associations first exhaust credit available from the Federal Home Loan Bank System before borrowing from the Fed ''needs reevaluation and is not appropriate at this time.''"

The Reagan Administration's decision to undertake a ''sweeping review'' of the tentative accords, which were reached last year after seven years of complex bargaining by as many as 163 nations, threw off stride the attempt to conclude the treaty this year.   While Washington studied the 440 draft articles prepared for the many-sided treaty, which would regulate use of the oceans and their resources, the conference mostly marked time at the seven-week session it held in New York last spring.   On the eve of the reconvening of the talks for another four- or five-week round, the conference's Secretary General, Bernardo Zuleta of Colombia, told reporters that he expected the United States to play a ''more positive role'' than at the spring session."

More generous depreciation schedules will be welcome, says Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist at Chase Econometrics, and consumer spending should rise as a result of individual tax cuts. But economic growth is likely to be far below Administration pro- jections, and budget deficits far higher, he predicts. The combination will keep interest rates high and temper investment enthusiasm. Continuing high rates of interest will not only make external financing difficult, but will keep the dollar strong, Mr. Chimerine expects, hurting exports and jeopardizing industries vulnerable to imports. Since fighting inflation seems to be Mr. Reagan's first priority, Robert Gough of Data Resources, Inc. doubts the Administration would be greatly concerned if investment showed only modest growth over the next few years. At present, he predicts the tax cuts will boost fixed investment 5 percent next year and 7 percent in 1983. ...And Worse Ahead?   Unless these tax cuts beget further budget cuts, the Administration's program could come unglued. If it does, business could be in for tough sledding in the 1980s. The Administration has pledged more cuts of up to $44 billion annually to achieve a balanced budget by 1984."

These projections have been made partly in the belief that the hazards of asbestos are finally well enough understood to prevent further dangerous exposure to asbestos fibers.   Inhalation of asbestos in past decades has caused tens of thousands of cancer deaths so far and is likely to result in 200,000 more cancer deaths over the next 20 years, according to medical experts at Mount Sinai Hospital Environmental Sciences Laboratory. It has also caused thousands of other workers to suffer asbestosis, a chronic and disabling respiratory disease that is occasionally fatal."

In Texas the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, which won a statewide rate increase in February, has requested another one that would double the minimum monthly charge for phone service in some cities.   The New York Telephone Company wants to nearly double the charge for installing a phone to $108.10 and to raise pay phone rates to 25 cents.

People speak about ''invading the desert,'' ''attacking the land'' and obtaining ''food security.''   The words are those used by President Anwar el-Sadat when he speaks, as he often does, of his Green Revolution and of Egypt's need to establish new communities in the desert to ease the strain on the fertile but overfarmed and overpopulated Nile valley and delta.   The facts that move Mr. Sadat to emphasize land reclamation and development are compelling. Only 4 percent of Egypt's land is cultivated, and practically all of the farm land is in the Nile valley and delta, where more than 95 percent of the nation's 42 million people live without much elbow room."

The man who brought the explosives into Jerusalem, the man who guarded a key corridor, the man who was drinking quietly in the bar, were there. But their commander, Menachem Begin, now Prime Minister of Israel, did not attend. He had been invited and had apparently vacillated all week, and finally did not appear."

Born in the Spindletop gusher of 1901 and financed by the Mellon fortune, Gulf went on to successfully challenge the Rockefeller oil empire. In dizzying succession, it opened the world's first gasoline filling station, acquired oceans of oil beneath the deserts of the Middle East and the swamps of Venezuela, and firmly established itself as one of the leading producers, refiners and purveyors of black gold.   Gulf is now the seventh-largest oil company in the world, the seventh-biggest company in America and a member of the planet's most exclusive business sorority - the Seven Sisters of international oil. On a warm summer evening, the orange light emanating from the crown of the company's headquarters tower in downtown Pittsburgh seems to suggest power, confidence and even a trace of deserved smugness.   Appearances, however, can be deceiving. Over the last half decade, Gulf has been hammered by a political payoff scandal, a battery of lawsuits, the loss of most of its prized foreign oil, declines in domestic output, a ludicrously disadvantageous natural gas sales contract and a devastating change in energy policy by the Government in Canada, where Gulf has vast holdings. Perhaps most painful, however, has been the combination of sharply reduced consumer demand and an overabundance of refining capacity, an industrywide affliction that is stinging Gulf particularly."

The Swiss adapted the classical cure for inflation - tight monetary and fiscal policies which created a recession, forcing wages and prices to fall and unemployment to rise - but their success was aided by two advantages not mentioned in the article.   First, the Bretton Woods system of fixed-exchange rates led to the Swiss currency being undervalued; the Swiss franc was appreciating in the aftermath of the 1973 oil embargo. With the price of oil pegged to the dollar, the Swiss ended up with cheaper oil after 1974 since the franc went up faster than the dollar price of oil."

But inside the staff offices, without the fanfare of committee hearings, lawyers and economists were down to shirtsleeves, working away on the snowballing proposals to cut taxes.    What began as two proposals from the President, tax cuts for business and for individuals, attracted a plethora of other provisions as it went through the Senate Finance Committee and is attracting yet more in the House Ways and Means Committee. Its scattershot growth displeases many.   ''It's nothing but fiscal graffiti,'' said Joseph A. Pechman, an economist and tax specialist at the Brookings Institution. What the committees are doing, he said, ''is loading the bill with provisions that cost a lot of money and will not achieve the desired objectives.''"

However little known in the United States, it is used regularly in more than 20 countries like jute, for making cordage. Today, a far more ambitious future is envisaged for kenaf. It could, its advocates contend, bail the paper-making industry out of periodic shortages of trees.   So far, the kenaf is only a gleam in the eye of American experts. A group of farmers in Homestead, Fla., have been growing it for 20 years on 110 to 200 acres. (The stems are used to make bean poles.) But since 1977, the American Newspaper Publishers Association has been actively exploring kenaf. At least six newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal and The Miami Herald, have printed papers on pulp made from the plant. And a major A.N.P.A. feasibility study on kenaf's newsprint potential is due out at the end of the year."

As soon as the sentence was pronounced in the Supreme Court here, one of the condemned men, David Moisi, turned in the dock, forced a smile and gave the clenched-fist salute to a courtroom that was crowded with white plainclothesmen and black sympathizers of the accused in almost equal numbers.   The 25-year-old Mr. Moisi was convicted of high treason for his role in the most widely noticed of the sabotage efforts, which resulted in the explosion of fuel storage tanks 14 months ago at South Africa's coal-to-gas conversion complex at Secunda. Johannes Shabangu, 26, threw a grenade at an office of the administration board that governs the black townships near Johannesburg - it was there that two people were injured by shrapnel, the only casualties in the sabotage attempts - and Bobby Tsotsobe, 25, was involved in an assault on a police station and several bombings."

''Ther will be no restriction on videotape recorder exports,'' said Kazu Kusaka, deputy director of the ministry's Americas-Oceania division, which handles trade matters with the United States. Asked about the recent reports, which appeared in several Japanese newspapers and were termed essentially accurate by a Government official yesterday, Mr. Kusaka replied, ''Some of my colleagues may have misled reporters.''   To Western economic experts here, the apparent divergence of opinion within the ministry, an agency whose officials typically hew to a single line, reflects the frenzied nature of the Japanese Government's efforts to trim its sizable and growing trade with the United States and Europe. Japan's trade surplus with the United States in 1981 is currently estimated at a record $15 billion. The Reagan Administration has warned that it expects substantial pressure later this year to take protectionist steps to limit imports from Japan."

Reagan Administration officials, key Congressmen and a wide range of nuclear policy specialists are asking themselves whether, in light of the raid and other recent developments, some new approach to the problem is required.   The question is being raised when several smaller nations either have or are on the verge of acquiring atomic weapons by clandestine means, when the safeguards imposed by the nuclear supplier nations are being criticized by those who fear the spread of nuclear arms as inadequate and when the Reagan Administration is about to announce its guidelines for curbing the spread of such weapons in the 1980's. A Topic for Ottawa   Because of the heightened concern over this Armageddon issue, as some specialists call it, it is certain to figure on the agenda next weekend when the leaders of the industrialized non-Communist world, which are the nuclear supplier nations, assemble in Ottawa for their annual economic meeting.   ''Ottawa represents an extradinory opportunity to get a grip on this problem,'' said Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who was prompted by the Israeli raid to write President Reagan urging, among other steps, an immediate moratorium on the transfer of potentially dangerous nuclear equipment and technology to sensitive areas such as the Middle East."

If Mr. Susko doesn't plan to stay with his product for more than a year, then maybe he knows something his superiors don't.   Wouldn't it make more sense for General Foods to move tactical brand decisions closer to strategic coffee division decisions? Given all the recent discussion of Japanese management skills and the importance of long-term product planning, shouldn't managers be evaluated on their ability to develop and nurture long-term consumer franchises?

Haig Jr.  today delivered a good part of the foreign policy speech that Mr.  President Reagan said last week did not need to be given, and he gave it on a matter that the Administration has up to now not cared to spotlight.   The subject was arms control talks with the Soviet Union and, according to his aides, Mr. Haig's aims were threefold: to reassure the worried West Europeans once again that the Administration is serious when it says that negotiations will begin soon with Moscow on medium-range missiles in Europe; to make this reassurance more believable by tying it to a set of principles and a long-term commitment to arms control; and to rees@tablish bipartisan support for arms control by giving a commitment to the process to satisfy the liberals while stressing the limitations on what arms control can be expected to achieve to please the conservatives.   ''We know where we're going,'' said Mr. Reagan last week, ''and think it might be counterproductive to make a speech about it.'' Less than a week later, the President and his principal advisers approved this Haig speech, according to officials, amid mounting criticism that the Administration has no foreign policy and a growing belief in Western Europe that the Administration contemplates arms control only grudgingly."

Meanwhile, Frank Perdue, chairman of Perdue Inc., the biggest poultry producer in the Northeast and another big corn user, noted that for every 40-cent-a-bushel drop in the corn price, the cost of dressed poultry falls 1 cent.

This same coal has also been the lifeblood of the N.& W., filling its cars, swelling its revenues and making the railroad, which is based in Roanoke, Va., the most profitable railroad in the country today. ''The N.& W. is the only coal pipeline in America to invest in,'' said Jack Kawa, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds.   This week, however, the N.& W. pulled a surprise move by announcing that it had purchased an 8.2 percent interest in Piedmont Aviation, a regional air carrier based in Winston-Salem, N.C., for $18.3 million. For a railroad so deeply tied to its traditional lines of business - coal and merchandise hauling - this announcement was startling. Even more surprising, however, was the N.& W.'s statement that it had made a merger overture to Piedmont this summer, which was rebuffed."

So she whipped up a prospectus for a magazine geared for women of all ages. She thought of calling it Woman or Self.   The following year, S.I. Newhouse Jr., Conde Nast's chairman, got excited about a physical fitness magazine, since fitness articles in Conde Nast magazines were much savored by readers. Ultimately, the powers decided to combine the two notions, and have Mrs. Wilson edit the result.   Thus, in late 1977, Conde Nast disclosed that it would give birth to a magazine in January 1979, its first new arrival since Glamour hit the racks 40 years before. The creation would be called Self."

When an assistant to Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink was asked where the idea originated, he said it came from the Municipal Research Institute.   The ''Institute'' is a single-room office occupied by its executive director and sole member, Daniel McCarthy, at 5 Beekman Street, near City Hall. Mr. McCarthy is a 27-year-old graduate of the State University at Stony Brook and its master's program in public management, who has worked for the city's Office of Economic Development and the Office of Management and Budget.   He left the city's service in impatience over what he considered a ''vacuum in the policy-making process,'' Mr. McCarthy said in an interview, and established himself as an independent consultant. A pleasantly voluble man with a disarming manner, he said that the idea for the gains tax was original. He presented it in a paper to the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in May. It was picked up by Assemblyman G.  Oliver Koppell of the Bronx, he said, and Mr. Koppell brought it to the attention of Mr. Fink."

Since 1948, in fact, Mr. Boyar, who is 56, has made the slogan ''the show must go on'' a reality - more so than any producer, director, writer or even a star - as he busily arranges insurance (for all risks) for half the shows on Broadway, some productions elsewhere, plus a certain number of actors and actresses as well.   In his small offices at 217 Broadway in lower Manhattan, Mr. Boyar wheels and deals with the top names in show business, mostly by phone, although ''sometimes I make house calls.'' It is often a 7 A.M. to 10 P.M. day for him -somewhat less for his wife Margery, his administrative aide, and his staff of 12.   Mr. Boyar, who maintains that no other broker specializes to the extent he does in theatrical insurance, handled about $5 million in premiums last year, on which his agency received commissions of about 10 percent. He shares no risks with the underwriters, usually in his case the Chubb insurance group."

Only the Pahlevis can govern Iran, she maintains, and only their return could save the country from pressures from the Soviet Union and the internal chaos that, she says, must inevitably be the heritage of the current Islamic Republic.   Princess Azadeh, who is the leader of the monarchist Free Iran movement here, made these statements in an interview this week.  The Princess is the daughter of Princess Ashraf, the Shah's twin sister, who heads the monarchist movement in the United States. She is also the sister of the late Prince Mustafa Chafik, who was gunned down outside her home here in 1979, apparently by agents of the Iranian revolutionary regime."

Some of his more fervent followers even shouted ''assassin'' at Vice President Oswaldo Hurtado Larrea during the funeral possession in Guayaquil."

The United States has retaliated by barring a senior Indian diplomat.   It is unusual for a government to block a foreign diplomat from taking up an assignment. Ambassadors are subject to scrutiny, but lower-ranking diplomats generally take up their posts without prior agreement. As a result, the Indians' refusal to accept Mr. Griffin is being described by State Department officials as ''unprecedented.''"

The officials said that Mr. Haig regards the forthcoming decision by Mr. Reagan on new missile deployment as crucial, not only for American defenses, but for maintaining allied unity. He is reportedly prepared to argue that, in addition to military and economic considerations, abandonment of the land-based MX plan would create additional political pressures in Western Europe against the deployment of American medium-range nuclear missiles there.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.36 points, to 940.54, in the biggest one-day decline since Jan. 20, when it fell 20.31 points. The decline brought the index closer to its lowest level of this year, 931.57, which it reached on Feb. 13.   Many investors were discouraged by President Reagan's apparent rejection of pleas for lower American interest rates made by leaders of the major industrial countries at the economic summit meeting under way in Ottawa. Industrialized nations have been adversely affected by the high United States interest rates that have caused an outflow of investment funds from their countries."

The reports were consistent with other indicators of a slumping economy. (Page D1.)   Americans' personal income rose 1.1 percent in August, the Commerce Department reported. About a quarter of the $26.9 billion rise came from high interest paid on investments. (D1.)"

Mr. Timerman has said that his 1977 arrest and subsequent torture during two and a half years in prison stemmed in large part from the fact that he is a Jew and from the alleged anti-Semitism of the Argentine Government.   Many Argentines who have survived the torture and secret jails report that Jews are often dealt extra punishment and that Nazi flags decorate some torture chambers.   On the tapes, Mr. Timerman can be heard acknowledging that he had expected his arrest because of his association with David Graiver, a fugitive financier who reportedly died the year before in a plane crash in Mexico."

In one of the most vital by-elections in decades, Roy Jenkins, a former Labor Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer, lost by only 1,759 votes to Douglas Hoyle, a member of the Labor Party's left wing. In May 1979, Sir Thomas Williams, now a judge, won the seat for Labor by 10,274 votes, one of the largest majorities in that general election.   Neither the most optimistic Social Democratic workers, nor the public-opinion polls, nor the leading British political commentators, had given Mr. Jenkins any chance of approaching the 42 percent of the vote that he achieved. Exultant in defeat, Mr. Jenkins said the result at Warrington, in northern England, would result in ''a Social Democratic-Liberal government with a huge majority'' if it were duplicated in a general election."

The theory, once known as ''separate development'' and still part of the guiding doctrine of South Africa, although it is seldom referred to by that name, holds that all of the 21 million blacks must be considered members of different black national states, depending on their ethnic origins.   But the theory ran into difficulties when it was applied to groups whose traditional lands bore no relation to their numbers in the modern state. South Sotho Ethnic Group   This was true, for instance, of the nearly two million South Sothos, the largest black group in the Orange Free State, who are ethnically related to the inhabitants of the internationally recognized state of Lesotho but had nothing that could reasonably be called a homeland within South Africa's borders."

The disclosure, which was made before a closed session of the President's Commission on Housing last week and repeated today at a Congressional hearing, provided stark, fresh evidence of the toll that high interest rates are taking on the thrift industry.   Savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks, together known as thrift institutions, are the country's principal mortgage lenders. High interest rates, combined with competitive pressures, have forced the institutions to pay more for deposits than they earn on mortgages, many of which were contracted over past years when interest rates were lower."

Ranging over southern Lebanon one day after guerrillas fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel, killing three persons, the Israeli pilots bombed the regional headquarters of Palestinian groups at the southern port city of Sidon and at Damur, 12 miles south of Beirut.   The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv said both guerrilla sites were destroyed.  The Israeli military commander, Lieut. Gen. Rafael Eytan, said the destruction of the bridges across the Zahrani and Litani Rivers marked the beginning of a new phase in attacks against Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon."

But a former French chef, in something of a gastronomic coup, has concluded a contract with the Iranian Government that could put the delicacy back on gourmet grocery shelves in the next month.   Under terms of the caviar contract, 65 tons of the world's most expensive eggs have arrived in Basel, Switzerland, to be sold to consumers at prices ranging from $210 to $320 a pound in Paris. The prices are comparable to those for the best Russian caviar. Before the 1979 United States boycott of Iranian caviar, it sold at $150 to $260 a pound in New York."

In Congress, among drug enforcement officials and in the State Department there seems to be a belief that only through aid programs and the introduction of alternative crops in opium-g@rowing areas of Pakistan can the United States hope to influence the flow of illegal drugs.   Officials and those watching the international drug trade from both within and outside the Administration say the martial law regime of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq has been cooperative in trying to cut back the production of opium and to halt the export of the drug, either as morphine or, increasingly, heroin.   They say the situation is not analogous to that of Bolivia, where the Reagan Administration withheld aid because of the former regime's reported complicity in the illegal cocaine trade."

The bond market's rally in the last two days pushed the bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury bond due in 2011 from Tuesday's low of 92 18/32 to a high yesterday of 95 1/4 before it closed at 94 12/32 to yield 14.7 percent. Despite that improvement, ''the preponderance of opinion on the Street still seems to be cautious to bearish,'' said Elliott Platt, a credit market analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation.   One prominent concern of the marketplace continues to be the possibility that a growing economy and heavy Treasury borrowing will raise interest rates. Another is that rates are already so high they will cause some unpredictable financial calamity."

The winner was, ''As   Canadian as possible under the circumstances.'' That self-putdown is also an apt description of the energy pricing agreement announced Tuesday night by two of Canada's perpetually feuding forces, the federal Government and the provincial government of Alberta, the country's chief oil producer.   The five-year agreement, which took more than a year of bitter headlines and quieter backroom bargaining to hammer out, was necessary because under Canadian law the federal Government controls the pricing of resources, but the provincial governments control the development and production of resources.   This kind of basic power split - the result of compromises forged toget four highly individual and jealous provinces to merge into one Canada in 1867 - has combined with a host of geographic, economic and political factors to produce a form of institutionalized friction that threatens to make Canada virtually ungovernable and regularly pushes this seemingly sedate nation of 21.1 million people onto the world's front pages."

Proponents contend that exports of Alaskan crude would result in cheaper oil prices for many American consumers who buy petroleum products refined along the Gulf Coast. In place of Alaskan oil, Gulf refiners would receive oil from Mexico, which costs less to transport.   Exports of Alaskan oil to Japan currently are banned under the Export Administration Act of 1979, which addressed possible problems of national security and was designed in part to stimulate the development of the tanker and shipping industries in the United States. Federal law requires that shipments between American ports must be made on United States ships."

American labor is worried that Reaganomics will spell higher unemployment and lower real wages. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and a host of private economists have fed those worries by warning that the economy is weakening. Just two months ago, the official forecast was for the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, to rise by 5.2 percent from the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of next year. That now looks far too optimistic. Industrial production took a sharp drop in August, and the economy appears to be on the brink of recession."

The bacteria, known as anaerobic microbes, live in oxygen-less environments and feed by breaking down organic compounds like formaldehyde and acetic acid.   Unfortunately, harnessing the anaerobic microbe's quirky appetite to the nation's growing waste disposal problems has been extremely difficult. While the microbes can break down and consume a wide range of deadly organic chemicals, they do not take too well to the sudden variations in the mixture that sometimes occur in industrial waste flows."

Specifically, the market had been moving sideways before President Nixon left the White House in August 1974. Many observers thought a strong rally would greet the Presidency of Gerald Ford."

In effect, Callon eliminates the risk of total failure for the owners while the partners earn their returns out of the gas discovered on the productive properties.

MARKET MOVING TO UNIFIED STOCK DATA,"  The over-the-counter stock market, that boundless arena where securites of up to 10,000 companies are traded daily by telephone rather than on the floor of an exchange, is making early steps toward combining trading information with the major stock exchanges.  The prospect is already making some securities dealers nervous.   A national market system linking the over-the-counter market with the bigger but slower growing exchanges is probably years away, but for stocks of 50 larger companies in the over-the-counter market, the changes will begin to emerge next February. Starting then, stock quotations for those 50 companies will show the opening, high, low and last price of the day's trades, along with the volume and closing bid and asked prices. Currently, only the volume and closing bid and asked prices are published."

Thomas O. Enders, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, was reported by diplomats to have told Nicaragua's junta and Sandinist commanders that the main obstacles to an improvement in relations were signs of continuing arms shipments to Salvadoran guerrillas and Nicaragua's own arms buildup, which he said was alarming other Central American nations.   In response, according to Nicaraguan officials, the Managua Government denied that it was supplying weapons to the Salvadoran left and justified its acquisition of new armaments, including some two dozen Soviet-made T-55 tanks, by pointing to increased American arms sales to the army-backed regimes in nearby El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Deterioration in Relations   But despite continuing disagreement on these issues, which have brought a sharp deterioration in relations under the Reagan Administration, United States and Nicaraguan officials said that the talks had been open and frank and that they hoped the dialogue would be maintained."

According to Jaime Barrios, who represents the interests of Chilean exiles at the United Nations, the Chilean Government action in forcing Jaime Castillo Velasco, the lawyer pursuing the investigation on behalf of the Letelier family, into exile last month effectively ended the possibility of showing that the Government of Gen.

The final decision is to be made by President Reagan by Oct.  13.   At issue is the cred ibility of a last-minute five-year commitment by Texas Inte rnational and its parent company, Texas Air Corporation,to equal or s urpass the Continental service to Micronesia."

Hungary wanted to build a blue jeans plant, but did not have enough hard currency to pay for it. The solution: Hungary bought equipment and expertise from Levi Strauss, and Levi Strauss agreed to buy back a share of the production. The company now takes 60 percent of the plant's annual output, about one million pairs a year, which it sells in Europe and Africa.   Levi's barter-like agreement and variations on it, commonly called countertrades, are no longer isolated events. In fact, so many deals have been struck in the past three years that government officials, bankers and industry analysts predict such commerce will account for 20 percent or more of all international trade in the 1980's, which now totals about $3 trillion a year. Some even say that barter has already reached that level.   The companies involved are some of the biggest names - General Motors, General Electric, Pepsico and McDonnell Douglas - and the number and size of the deals are so large that many companies have set up trading subsidiaries to handle the bartering affairs."

After three days of talks with China's leaders, Mr. Carter said he found Peking totally commited to deepening Chinese-American relations. He said he was reassured by a succession of prominent United States visitors, including Secretary of State Alexander M.  Haig Jr. in June, that President Reagan intended to adhere to agreements made during the Carter Administration.   The former President flew today to Xian to visit ancient Chin Dynasty ruins, where thousands of clay soldiers and horses are being unearthered around the tomb of Shih Huang-ti, the Chin Emperor who died in 210 B.C. In 1979, when Vice President Mondale visited the site, some Chinese explained that it was an early example of Chinese human rights because the Emperor had ordered the burial of clay statues instead of the live soldiers they represented."

However, by Lord Carrington's account, Mr. Gromyko gave no sign that Soviet thinking had changed to the point that a settlement was in sight.   ''The Soviet Union did not accept the proposal, but they did not say that they rejected it,'' Lord Carrington said at a news conference in the British Embassy. ''What they did say was that the plan was unrealistic in its present form, although I must say I found the arguments they advanced unconvincing.''"

President Reagan has won for business the largest tax reductions in memory, and as prodigious as they are, they are also a kind of culmination of a quieter trend, a decades-old ebbing of income taxes on business corporations. By the close of this decade, economists and tax specialists say, taxes on the profits of big business will have faded to a trickle.   The plain fact is in the numbers. Thirty years ago, Uncle Sam drew one tax dollar in four by taxing business profits; today it is one in 10 and still falling. And by realistic measures, the rate at which business is taxed has dropped by 50 percent since Harry Truman's day."

''What kind of spending and tax reductions will we get, and how are the economy and inflation going to be affected?''   In the bond markets, those questions have helped restrain buying of long-term issues so that prices have dropped for three weeks and the yield on bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due 2011 increased to about 13.3 percent by Friday from 12.55 percent on June 15. The issue yields less than the 13.99 percent it yielded when it was auctioned in early May, but the recent drop in prices showed that at current yields there is less demand for new long-term bonds than there is potential supply from the Treasury and corporations."

Until recently, while most analysts agreed that tough monetary policy would continue to hurt interest-sensitive sectors like housing and autos, they also thought high interest rates would do little more than dampen business elsewhere, resulting in sluggish growth - but growth nevertheless - the rest of the year. However, last quarter's 1.9 percent decline in economic activity may mean that a dampening has suddenly turned into recession.   Albert Sommers and Edward Yardeni, economists at the Conference Board and E.F. Hutton, respectively, find an unexpectedly large upturn in inventories particularly worrisome. Unlike a year ago, when companies anticipated recession and laid off workers early, this year producers in many sectors apparently concluded that high interest rates would not harm sales and kept workers on the job. But continued weakness in housing and construction could depress employment and weaken consumer sales."

A long article by the official press agency Tass offered Soviet readers none of the details set forth by Mr. Haig, and apart from dismissing the Secretary's charges as ''libelous and groundless,'' made no attempt to substantiate its rebuttal.   Instead, it countered with a chronicle of purported abuses by Washington, saying that ''no country in the history of international relations has used chemical weapons as extensively as the United States.'' Apart from American military practices in Vietnam, the Soviet agency said that American-manufactured chemical weapons were being used by anti-Government insurgents in Afghanistan and by the United States-backed junta in El Salvador."

Underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation said that the $250 million of New York Telephone's 15 5/8 percent debentures due 2021 will carry a price of 99 3/8, while a companion $150 million issue of 14 5/8 percent notes due 1991 was priced at 99.357 to yield 14.75 percent.   In other credit market activity, short- and long-term interest rates were little changed in quiet secondary trading, as participants waited for signs of renewed investor interest in long-term bonds and proof that the Fed is willing to encourage lower short-term rates.

In July, seasonally adjusted producer prices of finished goods rose only 5.5 percent at an annual rate from June and were up only 8.8 percent from a year earlier. This was in marked contrast to the 15 to 20 percent rates of increase seen in early 1980. A large part of the improved price performance reflects the worldwide oil glut and its impact on oil-related prices as well as the better-than-expected world agricultural outlook for 1981.   During the 1970's, so-called oil shocks and food-price shocks were important factors propelling the price level upward. Accordingly, it is argued that the recent improvement in inflation is only temporary; that the declines in food and oil prices cannot continue indefinitely, and that when these favorable trends reverse, the United States will return to double-digit inflation."
