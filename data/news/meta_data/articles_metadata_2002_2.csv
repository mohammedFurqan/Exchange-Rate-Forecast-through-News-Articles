Most speakers on the first day were African heads of state who called for removal of barriers to farm trade with developed countries and greater access by farmers in poorer nations to land, cheap loans, and technology for producing hardier crops. Mr. Annan, who is from Ghana, said that almost 200 million people in Africa, or 28 percent of the population, are chronically hungry, and that several countries in southern Africa face ''outright famine'' in coming months.

Among the new crop of digital manipulators was Dan Doerner, 41, who studied photography at the State University of New York at Albany, learned literally to cut and paste images in a darkroom to create collages, and eventually worked with an early version of Adobe Photoshop in 1989 while living in Los Angeles."

Nicholas III, the chief executive of Broadcom, the communications chip company, was ensuring that suits were the norm in attire for his 2,800 employees worldwide.    ''We didn't sit down and say that we wanted to be an anti-Silicon Valley company,'' Mr. Nicholas said. ''We just decided to run Broadcom with a different culture and management style.''    Leading by example, Mr. Nicholas, who is now 42, dresses in a suit, and employees know that business attire is the rule. But the company, once riding high, has seen its stock plummet, along with those of many other technology companies.    Mr. Nicholas and Henry Samueli, his former engineering professor at U.C.L.A., were co-founders of Baseband Technologies in 1991, working in the spare bedroom of Mr. Nicholas's condominium in Redondo Beach, Calif. After they renamed the company Broadcom, Mr. Nicholas earned a reputation for his love of the heavy-metal band Metallica and risky hobbies like skydiving.    He has no problem with confidence, even in the recent down market. ''From a long-term standpoint, the longer it goes on, the more of our competitors will die out,'' said Mr. Nicholas, who has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and is known for his fierce competitiveness.    Broadcom's stock is now trading at $22.55 on Nasdaq, down from a high of $273 in August 2000. In the first quarter of 2002, Broadcom narrowed its loss to $166.1 million on net revenue of $238.8 million, compared with a loss of $356.9 million in the comparable quarter of 2001 on net revenue of $310.5 million.    Broadcom, based in Irvine, Calif., since 1995, makes chips for cable modems, computer network switches, digital-cable TV set-top boxes, fiber optic equipment and server computers. Mr. Samueli, the company's chief technology officer, and Mr. Nicholas each own about 12 percent of the company, which at one point made each worth more than $5 billion.    In the last two years, Mr. Nicholas said, he has been focusing his energy on international acquisitions. ''Some weeks, I spend more time in the air than on the ground,'' he said, traveling the world on his private Challenger 601 jet, which seats 14. ''I probably sleep on the plane at least three nights a week. I like toys that make me more efficient.''   JULIE DUNN  "

At the time, they were not taken seriously. Today they read like a recounting of the economic events of the past decade in Japan. In 1996, Asai started a publishing enterprise, Daini-kaientai, which, among other things, issues financial newsletters to wealthy individual investors. He also runs an investors' club. His fans like his no-holds-barred critique of government policy and his bold counsel on how to defend one's wealth, including suggestions that people move to New Zealand. Asai believes the Japanese economy will probably collapse within a few years, possibly as early as next year, and that the government's assurances that it can never go bankrupt should not be accepted. He discussed ways that individuals can protect their assets with Miki Tanikawa. "
