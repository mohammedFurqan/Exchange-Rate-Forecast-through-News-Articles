BHUTTO ACCUSES U.S. OF DOUBLE STANDARD,"  The widow of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Pakistani Prime Minister who was executed in 1979, has accused the United States of using a double standard in its relations with the martial law Governments of Poland and Pakistan.   Nusrat Bhutto, whose husband was hanged by the Government of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq for what officials said was complicity in a plot to kill a dissident member of Mr. Bhutto's political party, is in West Germany for treatment of what doctors believe may be lung cancer.   ''It is unfortunate,'' Mrs. Bhutto said in a conversation at a hotel here Saturday. ''On the one hand the Americans support Zia for five and a half years, giving wheat, giving arms, giving F-16's.'' General Zia came to power after toppling Mrs. Bhutto's husband in a bloodless coup in 1977."

The Government's prize catch - a sharp blow to the fugitive union leadership - is Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the Silesian labor chief and one of the organizers of the union's five-man underground coordinating committee.   Thus far, there has been no response from the Solidarity underground to the plans to enact the long-awaited trade union bill at the session of Parliament opening on Friday.   An attempt was made Wednesday to broadcast a clandestine Solidarity message over the radio, but the signal was so weak that it could not be made out."

Many of the new measures effectively reverse the policies of the administration of Jose Lopez Portillo, which bequeathed Mexico's worst economic crisis in 40 years to President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado on Dec. 1.   Unlike his predecessor, who blamed external forces, such as the drop in oil prices and the rise in interest rates, for Mexico's troubles, Mr. de la Madrid has also stressed that the main answer to the crisis must be found at home, through a belt-tightening program to reduce the budget deficit. A lower deficit would reduce foreign borrowing to finance it. Postponement Asked of Banks   As a quid pro quo for the austerity measures that he has already enacted, Finance Minister Jesus Silva Herzog, in a telex message last weekend to Mexico's 1,400 foreign bank creditors, formally asked for a restructuring of $20 billion worth of Government debt due between August of this year and December 1984 and for $5 billion in new credits next year to ease the country's balance-of-payments crisis.  In effect, the banks were asked to postpone all repayment of debt principal through Dec. 31, 1984."

''Hal, I've got some good n ews and some bad news,'' the businessman said. ''Congratulations on w inning our account - but we're cutting the budget 50 percent.''  What seemed at the time to be a mixed blessing has been nothing but trouble for Carr Liggett, one of Cleveland's top agencies. At that reduced spending level, it hasn't made a dime on the account, and Mr. Shoup's rueful tone suggests that the shop may even have lost some money.  Ad agencies across the country have been enduring similar hardships all year - and 1983 isn't expected to be much better. The current recession has caused many advertisers to reduce spending from projected levels. And as the year progressed and the recovery became the subject of macabre jokes rather than strategic planning, the cutbacks accelerated. For some companies, such as Republic Steel, Phelps Dodge and Kenwood Electronics's home audio division, what was once a 1982 ad budget is now just a memory."

Andropov was quoted today as saying that a meeting with President Reagan could be a ''very effective'' way of improving relations between Moscow and Washington but that the success of any meeting would depend on ''good preparatory work.''   The press agency Tass also quoted Mr. Andropov, the Soviet party leader, as saying he believed that there was ''every possibility'' of the two nations' working out compromise agreements on nuclear arms issues because there were solutions available ''which do not prejudice the interests of either side.''   The remarks came in a Tass text of replies provided to written questions submitted through the Soviet Embassy in Washington by Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, an editor of the Hearst newspapers.   In the United States, Mr. Kingsbury-Smith said that the questions were submitted to the embassy on Dec. 22 and that Mr. Andropov's replies were delivered through the embassy Wednesday."

Here, too, there are cannon and ramparts, none of local origin, that chart a troubled history of slavers and traders and foreign forces that vied for dominance in this westernmost tip of Africa.  And, the visitor may find, there are signs of a newer subordination that has made Africans complain of economic bondage bequeathed along with political independence, a vulnerability to the vagaries of distant markets and uncontrollable climates at home and to continued influence by former colonial powers.   The visitor arrives on Goree Island, a 20-minute ferry ride from the Senegalese capital of Dakar, aboard a vessel that is the settlement's only means of support. It brings the foreign tourists who pay local youths a small sum for their services as guides and who patronize the Hostellerie du Chevalier de Boufflers, the island's sole restaurant, that sells wine and Perrier water from France, along with food of similar origin. Usually the guests are French too, from a community of 20,000 in Senegal that includes 1,200 French soldiers, stationed, as elsewhere in French-speaking Africa, as part of France's postcolonial presence."

The executives pressed for removal of a surcharge on an insurance tax that is paid for all employees, stronger negotiating stands with some trading partners, relief from local taxes and changes in energy pricing. They clearly wanted to play down disagreements with the Conservative administration of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as Britain heads into a year when she is expected to call a national election.   The generally temperate tone of the three-day meeting was typified by Sir Terrence Beckett, the organization's chief executive. This was in contrast to two years ago when he created a rift in the membership by advocating a ''bare-knuckled'' approach to the Government on issues over which it and the confederation were at odds. This year he said: ''The biggest job is for industry. On the side, we need some help from the Government.''"

Residents of northern states have long wished that Canadians would keep their cold to themselves, and they are beginning to feel the same way about Canada's exports of gas, much of which is used for domestic heating.   In the midst of a worldwide fuel surplus and deep stagnation in the Canadian economy, pressure is building on Ottawa to reduce gas prices, too.   According to 75 members of Congress, who expressed their sentiments in a recent letter to President Reagan, and to one of the Administration's own energy regulators, the price of Canadian gas is simply too high - $4.94 a thousand cubic feet, compared with an average price of gas produced in the United States of $2.27."

Defense accounts for some 29 percent of the nation's total budget, or about $150 billion this fiscal year, and the pressures to pare or not to pare it are likely to mount as Election Day nears. Defense plans call for real growth rates in 1984 of 10 percent and for 7 percent each in 1985 and 1986."

Madison Avenue has traditionally categorized the buying public into such amorphous groups as housewives (18 to 54 years of age), upscale working women (18 to 34), or urban men (34 to 55). But such divisions give advertisers little insight into people's life styles, personal values or goals -all of which affect the way they decide to spend their money.

After years of in-depth interviews with consumers, the Stanford Research Institute created VALS - for Values and Life Styles -to provide Madison Avenue with an economic, social and emotional profile of American society.

Andropov have been linked to those of Hungary. Mr. Andropov, the new Soviet party leader, served in the Soviet Embassy in Budapest from 1953 to 1957, initially as a second-rank official, then as Ambassador.   Those were troubled times, marked by growing unrest, by the 1956 uprising and by the installation of Janos Kadar as head of the Hungarian Communist Party.   So were the years that followed. Mr. Kadar began evolving his program of economic decentralization, and Mr. Andropov, by then back in Moscow, was largely responsible for allowing him to develop the program in his position overseeing the Central Committee's dealings with Eastern Europe. Hungarians Willing to Talk   Mr. Andropov's tenure in Hungary gives his background a special quality. No other top Soviet leader since Lenin has ever lived outside the Soviet Union. And it offers the West a chance to learn something about the man. The Hungarians know him well, and they are willing to talk; people in the Soviet Union have usually found it prudent to say nothing, or to hew to a prearranged line, in discussing the country's leaders."

The change had profound effects on products and corporate fortunes. MOS technology helped make possible new types of complex chips, such as the microprocessors used in personal computers and high-capacity memories. And those companies that were able to exploit the new technology were able to rise to prominence. One such company was the Intel Corporation, in which the International Business Machines Corporation yesterday bought a 12 percent stake.

These n ew products are also luring investors into the underlying c ommodities markets, where the risks are even greater.   Among those new investors are many who do not even know what commodities their money is riding on, whether they are long or short any market, or how price moves are affecting their investments at any given moment - nor do they particularly care.   These investors are not irrationally reckless; indeed, they are probably being cautious. They are putting their money into commodity funds, or pools as they are called by the trade. Such funds, which ''pool'' the money of many investors and are managed by professional commodities traders, have been around for some time now. They allow a commodity ''play,'' but spread and limit the risk."

The United States is expected to propose more than 100 changes, including many additions, in the list of controlled exports at a meeting in Paris next week of the Coordinating Committee for Exports to Communist Areas, known as Cocom. It will also press for a substantial increase in Cocom's budget and expansion of its enforcement abilities.   The committee, founded in the late 1940's, includes the United States, its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization except Iceland, and Japan."

A clash in a bar between whites and aborigines ended early Friday with the death of one aborigine, 19-year-old Ronald McIntosh, and the wounding of two others, Stephanie Duke and Warren Tighe. Today police officers from Sidney were called in by the state government to keep peace in Moree, a town of 10,000 people.   The New South Wales government acknowledged that there were serious problems in towns like Moree that have large aboriginal populations.  ''The Moree tragedy stems from deep social and economic ills which beset people of western New South Wales towns, conditions such as severe unemployment, poor health and bad housing,'' the statement said."

Speaking at a news conference for foreign correspondents, Mr.  Gharazi said that Iran had set a production goal of three million barrels a day -more than twice the quota of 1.2 million barrels set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Iran's goal would be the limit of the Iranian oil fields in their current condition, according to Western experts.   He said, however, that the production target had not been reached because of ''direct pressure'' from Saudi Arabia on Iran's oil markets."

MacAvoy's argument for immediately deregulating natural gas, as espoused in ''The Time to Deregulate is Now'' (Sept.26), assumes unreal economic conditions.   Professor MacAvoy overlooks contractual provisions between pipelines and producers which turn a ratchet on wellhead prices and inhibit market signals from getting to the producers. For example, indefinite escalator clauses would permit decontrolled gas to rise immediately to the highest price of a particular region, thus raising gas prices substantially above the market clearing level. ''Take or pay for'' provisions, where pipelines must ''take or pay for'' gas amounts contracted from producers, prevent pipelines from negotiating for lower-priced gas and further inhibit the market from reacting normally."

Based on that finding, Leo Burnett, the Chicago advertising agency, created ads for Swanson frozen TV dinners that showed an overworked housewife reaching for the product. The campaign proved ill-conceived when it made its debut some years ago. Harassed consumers, it turned out, did not like to be reminded of how hectic their lives were.   In a study in the early 1970's, Needham, Harper & Steers/Chicago, on behalf of its client, the McDonald's Corporation, confirmed what consumers could see for themselves: Many fast-food establishments were dingy. The agency set about making McDonald's fast-food outlets seem more inviting."

He was recommended yesterday for the position by John S. Reed, the 65-year-old chairman and chief executive who will retire after the annual meeting next April.   Analysts expect Mr. Schmidt, 54, to markedly change Santa Fe's management strategy. The two top executives have long disagreed over which direction to take Santa Fe, which earned $154 million on sales of $2.4 billion in this year's first nine months. Mr. Reed has a reputation as a staunch railroad man, while Mr. Schmidt is viewed as finance-oriented."

Lerner, one of the greatest economists of this century.   Professor Lerner, who died three weeks ago in Tallahassee, Fla., at the age of 79, always called the issues as he saw them, whatever special economic or political interests were involved. And he always pursued the broad interests of humanity, seeking to base his advice on scientific fact and logic.   He did not care whether he was labeled a Socialist or capitalist, and he was actually something of both. He regarded such labels as capitalism and Communism as misleading and, even worse, corrupting of scientific thought on how to help people advance their own welfare freely - and at the same time advance the well-being of the society as a whole. What Mr. Lerner sought to serve was what he called ''everybody's business.''"

BHUTTO ACCUSES U.S. OF DOUBLE STANDARD,"  The widow of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Pakistani Prime Minister who was executed in 1979, has accused the United States of using a double standard in its relations with the martial law Governments of Poland and Pakistan.   Nusrat Bhutto, whose husband was hanged by the Government of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq for what officials said was complicity in a plot to kill a dissident member of Mr. Bhutto's political party, is in West Germany for treatment of what doctors believe may be lung cancer.   ''It is unfortunate,'' Mrs. Bhutto said in a conversation at a hotel here Saturday. ''On the one hand the Americans support Zia for five and a half years, giving wheat, giving arms, giving F-16's.'' General Zia came to power after toppling Mrs. Bhutto's husband in a bloodless coup in 1977."

The Government's prize catch - a sharp blow to the fugitive union leadership - is Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the Silesian labor chief and one of the organizers of the union's five-man underground coordinating committee.   Thus far, there has been no response from the Solidarity underground to the plans to enact the long-awaited trade union bill at the session of Parliament opening on Friday.   An attempt was made Wednesday to broadcast a clandestine Solidarity message over the radio, but the signal was so weak that it could not be made out."

Many of the new measures effectively reverse the policies of the administration of Jose Lopez Portillo, which bequeathed Mexico's worst economic crisis in 40 years to President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado on Dec. 1.   Unlike his predecessor, who blamed external forces, such as the drop in oil prices and the rise in interest rates, for Mexico's troubles, Mr. de la Madrid has also stressed that the main answer to the crisis must be found at home, through a belt-tightening program to reduce the budget deficit. A lower deficit would reduce foreign borrowing to finance it. Postponement Asked of Banks   As a quid pro quo for the austerity measures that he has already enacted, Finance Minister Jesus Silva Herzog, in a telex message last weekend to Mexico's 1,400 foreign bank creditors, formally asked for a restructuring of $20 billion worth of Government debt due between August of this year and December 1984 and for $5 billion in new credits next year to ease the country's balance-of-payments crisis.  In effect, the banks were asked to postpone all repayment of debt principal through Dec. 31, 1984."

The Soviet aim, he says, would be to win any war in Europe in three to four days before commanders of the North Atlantic Organization could obtain approval from political leaders to fire their tactical nuclear weapons.   This concept is described in the quarterly International Defense Review by Christopher N. Donnelly, a senior analyst at the Soviet Studies Research Center of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, England.   Under such a concept, Mr. Donnelly says, one divisional-size ''Operational Maneuver Group'' would be drawn from each of the five Soviet armies in East Germany, and they would seek to penetrate the forward defenses of the Western alliance at high speed. He suggests that they would also attempt to halt alliance reinforcement, eliminate tactical nuclear weapons sites and destroy field headquarters but that they would not use tactical nuclear weapons."

In a ruling in September, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said the state's Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, which had held more than three years of hearings on the project, erred when it failed to consider the possible carcinogenic effects of particulates that might be emitted from the plant's smokestack. The court ordered the agency to hold further hearings.   The 73-megawatt plant, which would be diesel-powered, is in the Mission Hill section of Boston, and the suit that led to the court order was brought by local residents and the neighboring town of Brookline."

President Burnham's opponents, as well as numerous members of the diplomatic community here, say that his continued political good health is the result of rigged elections, manipulation of the work force in the largely nationalized industrial sector and political repression, possibly including the assassination of a political opponent two years ago.   President Burnham, a large, bearded man with a quick wit and a disconcerting laugh, painted a very different picture from that heard on the streets. In an interview in his modest book-lined office here, he brushed aside charges against him, crediting his political wellbeing to a slowly growing public understanding of the goals of his ''cooperative socialism'' and to a disorganized and ineffectual opposition."

Time Inc., that is.  Five years ago, cynics at Time Inc. were betting that the giant communications company would fold Money, the personal finance monthly it introduced in 1972. Money was a money-loser. ''There were some questions about whether Money would survive,'' said Marshall Loeb, the magazine's managing editor.   Money marks its 10th anniversary this month. And despite its difficult debut, Money's outlook today is upbeat. After eight years of losses and a major shift in editorial strategy, Money has survived and prospered.

The measure, which is aimed at Japan, is intended to encourage foreign auto makers to build their cars here, thereby creating jobs in the ailing domestic automotive industry.

DeLorean decided in the 1970's to produce a hot new sports car, his intention was to build an ''ethical'' auto. By that, Mr. DeLorean said, he meant one that did not disintegrate five years after it rolled off the showroom floor.   There seems little question that Mr. DeLorean's creation will be seen on the road in the months ahead, auto experts say. What is at issue is the true worth of the stainless-steel car - its original listed price was $25,000 - and whether it will become a collector's item as a result of the closing of the DeLorean factory in Northern Ireland and Mr. DeLorean's arrest on drug charges in Los Angeles."

Unit,"  THE Trane Company's decision to make an all-cash purchase of General Electric's residential central air-conditioning business instead of the cash-and-stock combination originally planned suggests that Trane is no longer fearful of a takeover.   The original deal was made after O'Connor Securities and O'Connor & Associates acquired a block of Trane stock, and threw a scare into Trane that an unfriendly takeover bid might be forthcoming. O'Connor recently increased its position to 15.3 percent of the company's 10.2 million shares outstanding.   Trane was going to pay $100 million in cash plus enough shares to give G.E. a 15 percent stake in the business. Analysts say that worked out to $165 million. That plan might have deterred a takeover, but would have meant some earnings dilution. From a fundamental point of view, then, analysts prefer the new plan, under which Trane is paying $135 million cash."

McDonald & Little, the agency that put Atlanta into the advertising limelight during the mid-1970's by landing the city's first national account, lost a $10 million account to a Chicago agency early this fall. This, in addition to the loss of two other major accounts since the agency was acquired last year by Ted Bates International in New York, means the company's billings will drop this year to about $20 million, from $51 million in 1981.   Before being acquired last year by Bates, McDonald was the city's largest independent ad agency and, with Henderson Advertising in Greenville, S.C., one of the South's two largest."

After Mr. Mitterrand's Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, said recently that there would be no increase in the minimum wage, and talked about the need to increase management profit margins, the question seemed real, but very awkward.   For French conservatives, there is no profit in suggesting that Mr. Mitterrand's operating principles in a time of economic problems are now rather like everyone else's in the Western industrial world.

Once the i nflation was under way, high unemployment rates followed, like the n ight the day. Untouched by human hands, one might say.  The real story is very different. The inflation was mostly caused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Unemployment has been purposely induced and purposely tolerated to fight it."

Seemingly contradictory statements by two key members of Prime Minister P.W. Botha's Cabinet in recent days have left them guessing again.   Defense Minister Magnus Malan, who is often portrayed as a protege of the Prime Minister, seemed to tell a Cape Town business group in unmistakable terms on Saturday that the Government could not accept a settlement that would result in a victory by the South-West Africa People's Organization, the insurgent movement that has been trying to dislodge South African forces from the disputed territory.   On Tuesday night Foreign Minister Roelof F.

The Reagan Administration had declined to resume the Madrid talks with the Soviet Union because of the continuing crackdown in Poland.  But the Americans have now won allied consent to make any East-West accord conditional on the Russians accepting and living up to such measures as allowing free trade unions and ending radio jamming.   A senior Administration official said today that the American willingness to resume work on a final Madrid document was more tactical than substantive. He said it was inconceivable to the Administration that the Russians would accept the terms that would be laid down by the NATO alliance, or that any document would be approved."

''There is nothing new in the economy that sheds much light on where the market is going in the near term,'' said Joseph Bench, vice president at Shearson/American Express. ''The key will be the Fed's behavior after the elections.''   The consensus view is that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market will soon drop below 9 1/2 percent and will be accompanied by one or more reductions in the discount rate, which the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions. According to many Fed watchers, the central bank may wait until Nov. 12, when money supply data for October is to be announced, before reducing the discount rate from the current 9 1/2 percent level."

The main point that Mr. Bush and Mr. Shultz intend to make, the officials said, is that the Administration believes that the Soviet Union is largely responsible for the deterioration of relations by its moves in such places as Afghanistan, Poland and Cambodia, and by its imprisonment of dissidents and its tighter emigration policy."

Investor demand for the new 10 3/4 percent bonds, due in February 2003, was not as strong as for the 10 1/2 percent, seven-year notes that sold a day earlier at an average yield of 10.58 percent, dealers said.   While prices of most Treasury issues fell slightly, the seven-year issue closed at an offered price of about 99 30/32, to yield 10.51 percent, down from 100 3/8 earlier in the day, but well above the average price at Tuesday's auction of about 99 19/32.   Prices fell from the best levels of the day, traders said, partly because of disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not buy securities for its own account - thereby giving the markets a sign that it is encouraging lower short-term rates by making credit more plentiful in the banking system. Other analysts said the drop of the past two days in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could indicate that the Fed is encouraging lower shortterm rates."

After a debate that took an unexpectedly passionate turn, Mr. Kohl was chosen Chancellor with a seven-cote margin on a procedure known as a constructive no-confidence motion, which simultaneously toppled Mr. Schmidt and designated his successor.   It was the first time in the 33-year history of the Federal Republic that a Chancellor had been removed by Parliament. Reagan Administration officials expressed satisfaction that West Germany would now have a Government ""more in tune with the Reagan philosophy"" but voiced uneasiness that West German politics might become polarized.

The other day Ambassador Burns talked to the commanders of the German federal armed forces and he said, ''My Government has become doubtful about the advantages of detente; your Government, on the other hand, perceives continuing benefits.'' I wonder what you think of that?   A. If Arthur Burns, in saying this sentence means - that is the way I understood it - that we take a strictly realistic line in our policy, that we are not engaged in any kind of dreams or illusions, then this is exactly the line I'm following.   First of all, we are a firm member of the European community.  Parallel to this is the very closely tied partnership and friendship to the United States.  NATO first of all means a community of ideas, a community of countries which share free and liberal constitutions, with human rights, basic fundamental rights, civic rights. It is my feeling that we have given too little attention to these values and we have given too much attention to the arms. Of course, arms are important. In my policy statement I made three weeks ago, I made the point that the raison d'etre of this country requires friendship and ties with the U.S.; it is part of that raison d'etre. By making this point I had in mind this community of ideas."

Despite many local tactical alliances between Communists and Socialists, there is no question of a popular front of the left on the national level, according to Socialist sources. In fact the toughest battles are likely to occur where Communist and Socialistbacked candidates are competing directly for municipal seats, such as in Larissa and Patras."

Mr. Yamanaka, 61 years old, is a long-time politician and a former director general of the defense agency who is known as an expert in domestic affairs, but with little international experience."

The contract is to supply France with airborne radar, which would give advance warning of attacking planes, missiles, ships and tanks.  The need for such so-called Eye-in-the-Sky planes, military experts say, has been underscored by the recent wars in Lebanon and the Falkland Islands.   In Lebanon, the Israelis used airborne radar to guide their fighters, which shot down more than 100 Syrian MIG's, and to locate antiaircraft missile bases, which were then destroyed."

What makes them exceptional is that Mr. Whiteley, a former merchant seaman with a straw-colored beard and mustache, happens to be white; his wife, who is of Indian descent, is brown. From those scant epidermal facts it can be deduced that Mr. and Mrs. Whiteley are living together in flagrant violation of at least three laws that are basic to the system known as apartheid.   There is the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, which does exactly what its title says. There is the Immorality Act, which makes it a crime for a white to have any sexual contact with a person of another race.

This could make it more difficult for the business community to increase giving at the request of the Reagan Administration, as the Government cuts back on support for education, welfare and the arts.   The condition of company foundations is ''industry specific,'' said Mary Hall, vice president of the Weyerhaeuser Company Foundation.

In other industries, such as high technology, it is expected that company giving will increase."

Rather t han choose, a number of them are opting for convertible debentures, a hybrid security that its fans call the best of all possible w orlds. A convertible debenture is sold as a $1,000 face value bond, w ith a fixed maturity and coupon, but it allows an investor to e xchange the bond for a fixed number of common shares, usually those o f the issuing corporation. The convertibles sell at a discount or p remium in the secondary market (100 is par), and their yields vary a ccordingly.   If the past history of convertibles holds true, they might provide greater downside protection than the common stock to which they are wedded in the event the predictions of a lasting bull market don't pan out. And they would presumably rise in price faster than straight bonds (though not as fast as the underlying common) if the market does continue its surge. At the same time, the convertible offers a far more attractive yield than the common stock dividend, although usually not as rich as that of a straight bond. Convertible preferred stocks, sister securities, act in much the same fashion."

Mr. Zhao called the modest annual growth target of 4 percent ''safe and appropriate, allowing room for overfulfillment.''

The strategy balances highly visible gestures of conciliation, particularly toward the Roman Catholic Church, with a steely use of the powers of state, including a new framework of laws and the overwhelming deployment of masses of special riot policemen to make sure the populace stays in line.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries that imposed economic sanctions on Poland last February in response to the military takeover - a withdrawal of credits that has sorely hurt the already crippled economy by cutting off new hard currency loans to pay for imported parts and materials essential to the country's industry - set three conditions for lifting the punitive measures.  These were the resumption of discussions with the Roman Catholic Church and the nation, the release of the Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other detainees, and the end of martial law. At the same time President Reagan imposed sanctions against the Soviet Union, which were lifted last week while leaving in place those against Poland."

It was the biggest decline since April and evidence that the slumping economy has still not touched bottom.   The decline was the 13th in the industrial production index - a measure of the output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities - in the last 15 months.   The October decline, the third straight after a tiny gain in July, was dominated by weakness in motor vehicle and business equipment production. Analysts did, however, take some comfort from the fact that automobile sales, aided by lower interest rates on car loans, have picked up recently and they said that there was good reason to expect this to be reflected soon in higher production."

Several officials involved in dealing with the Soviet Union said in interviews in recent days that there was a consensus among American intelligence officials that Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader for the last 18 years, was in such poor health that he was likely to be replaced soon. But there is no agreement on when this might occur, or who would succeed him, officials said.   Mr. Brezhnev, who will be 76 years old in December, is believed to have been in poor health for years, particularly in the last four years, when his public appearances have decreased drastically."

And based on the reception these new futures have received, there is no shortage of people who want to bet on the market.   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, more than 1.9 million contracts based on the Standard & Poor's Corporation's 500-stock index changed hands in the six months between April 21, when trading began, and the end of October. By contrast, trading volume in domestic certificates of deposit futures, which, until the introduction of S.& P. futures, had been the exchange's hottest new contract, amounted to only 1.4 million contracts in the 10 months through October.   What accounts for all the excitement? Well, the new index futures offer investors a variety of possibilities: some may want to hedge equity portfolios; arbitragers can take advantage of the minute differences in the values of separate contracts, and there is even a school of thought that holds that the indexes can be used as a market forecasting tool. But certainly the most intriguing aspect of these new investment vehicles is the chance to bet on the direction of stock prices for a fraction of the cost of buying a diversified equity portfolio."

Elsewhere in the country, however, results were mixed. Chicago's two major banking companies showed relatively weak results, while earnings at most of those in California were under downward pressure.    The biggest factor in the strength of the New York bank holding companies was a sharp decline in interest rates during the quarter.  The companies' rise in earnings came largely at the expense of borrowers. This was because of an unusually large spread between the interest rates that banks charged on the loans they made and the interest rates that the banks themselves paid for funds."

The three-man commission published a resolution, in accordance with the law, warning the officials, who included Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. The panel said the officials might be found to have failed in their duties by not being aware of the dangers of asking Christian Phalangist militiamen to enter two Palestinian refugee camps, and, in some cases, of neglecting to act quickly to reports to stop the deaths of as many as 800 Palestinian men, women and children.   The spokesman, Bezalel Gordon, said at a briefing today that the purpose of issuing the resolution was to warn the officials that they were ''liable to be harmed'' by the commission's findings and to give them 15 days in which to decide whether they wish to retain lawyers, reappear before the commission to examine testimony and to cross-examine witnesses."

Such measures are similar, Mr. Reagan said, to ''the painful steps necessary to overcome the economic crisis that threatens our people'' in the United States.   Among the Brazilian austerity steps are cuts in Government social programs, a reduction in imports and possible cuts in workers' wage increases."

While some foreign diplomats attribute Mozambique's poor economic performance to unsuccessful socialist ventures, the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front has made what one diplomat called ''only a pious bow'' in the direction of looser economic controls to provide greater incentives. Instead, recently published guidelines for next year's party congress call for ''the reinforcement of the controlling position of our Marxist-Leninist party.''   The guidelines are framed in what are called the ''eight theses'' up for discussion at the fourth party congress of the Mozambique Liberation Front, known as Frelimo. The first of these says: ''Our conquests result from the socialist nature of our revolution. Only the people's struggle under the direction of Frelimo can defend, consolidate and widen them.''"

Dealers said that the failure of the Federal funds rate and the discount rate to come down caused the poor reception accorded the Treasury's new $6 billion of three-year notes, which were auctioned Wednesday, and the equal lack of retail interest in yesterday's $4 billion of 10-year Treasury notes. All this weighed heavily on the money market.   For more than a week, the market has been expecting a cut in the discount rate, which the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions. Traders have also been expecting the Fed to push down the Federal funds rate, which is the interest on overnight loans between banks. Any reduction of these two key rates stimulates investment, tending to raise the prices of fixed-income securities and lower their yields."

''You've got to be deaf, dumb and blind not to be able to do business now.''   ''The psychological momentum is out there - those who do have money are beginning to turn it loose, and those who don't have it, don't have to worry about it anyhow,'' said Joseph Ancona, a senior vice president of Daniel & Bell Inc., a small New York brokerage firm, as he stood in a crowded, sumptuous oceanside reception."

Their answer: Not much.   The alumni were concerned about Western companies facing competition from the Japanese, who, they said, have ''beaten us in the human resources management area and turned it into a competitive advantage,'' said Prof. D. Quinn Mills.   Harvard began requiring a course in human resources management in the spring of 1981, covering union relations as well as sex discrimination, compensation and productivity. Today Harvard is emphasizing work force relations even more and the subject is making its way into many courses because it is seen as a competitive business weapon.   But despite the addition of the course and the revamping of other parts of the curriculum, some professors grumble that Harvard's business education needs a more fundamental overhaul. They share a nagging doubt: that some research is getting too academic and Harvard may be neglecting to teach managers how to put into effect the strategies they develop."

The first, strictly a publishing industry matter, was what role reader research should play in editorial decision-making; the second was protectionism as a matter of national policy.   The big picture, which included far more than just protectionism, was handled by former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.; William M. Agee, well-known chairman of the Bendix Corporation and also the president of the Allied Corporation, and Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.   The inside issue was in the hands of Steve H. Price, executive vice president/general manager of Newsweek, and John Mack Carter, the legendary editor of Good Housekeeping. Because they were insiders, the audience of magazine publishers, advertising executives and members of the American Society of Magazine Editors responded more readily to them than to their invited guests. After all, the problem they presented was one they could handle, unlike those presented by the men with the global view."

Next to them was a lean-to, draped with a banner that exhorted, ''Let's stop Soviet mad dreams.''   The burly insurgent leader, in starched camouflage fatigues and a green beret with three gold stars on it, stood in the shade of the lean-to while a chorus of 30 sang a kind of revolutionary torch song in ardent Portuguese, exalting his leadership. The ceremony here Sunday afternoon at the headquarters of Mr. Savimbi's Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as Unita, seemed a cross between a political rally and prize-giving day at the end of a wilderness survival course."

He has been praised for his inventive use of modernist conceits and his ability to conjure up an entire continent in the imagination; at the same time he has been chided for ideological posturing and for writing short stories that tend to cramp his style and inhibit his formal powers.   I.B.

The new American plan represents a substantial narrowing of positions between the United States and other countries. Earlier this year Washington had resisted any increase, while other countries were urging a minimum of 50 percent.   Reagan Administration representatives also said they now wanted a shorter timetable for getting the new resources into place at the fund, which is the principal agency for such aid."

Why risk trying to make it 50 percent?'' Those were the sentiments of money manager Robert Torray, after several furious weeks in October of taking profits by selling off $500 million in stocks and moving the proceeds into Treasury bills and other short-term securities. The money is still there, according to Mr. Torray, whose firm manages a total of $1.5 billion for pension funds, waiting ''until we find stocks we think are too cheap. Right now there are not many around.''   Judging from the sawtooth pattern of the stock indexes in the last couple of weeks, a number of other money managers have also become leery of the market's ability to sustain its current prices. In fact, last Monday and Tuesday saw some of the highest levels of institutional selling this year. Hit hard by the selling were utility stocks, along with technology, aerospace and food issues - groups that had been among the best gainers of recent months. But also afflicted with heavy institutional selling were the lackluster machinery stocks, which may indicate that some institutions have lost faith in an imminent economic recovery."

One survivor, 57-year-old Mateo Ramos Paiz, said he witnessed much of the killing and was saved when he was trapped under the corpses of some 10 men who had been killed by grenades.   ''I apologized to the dead, took my boots off and fled after dark,'' he recalled in an emotional account.  Another villager said he escaped death when he and seven other peasants were ordered to bring two cows from nearby fields to be slaughtered to feed the soldiers."

Tabulation of the votes, while not yet complete, showed that the I.R.A.'s political organization, Sinn Fein, had picked up two more seats, for a total of five, in the 78-member assembly. This showing was widely regarded as an important psychological victory for the party, which entered 12 candidates, all in urban areas where Roman Catholics are concentrated, and campaigned on a slogan of ''A ballot in one hand and a gun in the other.''"

By aggressively generating foreign sales, now about 60 percent of their total, the companies had been able to shield themselves from the slump affecting their German clients - the construction, automobile and textile industries. But this year, diminished orders from debt-stifled developing countries and from customers in European countries whose currencies have weakened against the West German mark are putting strong pressure on sales and profits.   BASF A.G. reported today that its pretax profits in the third quarter totaled 122 million marks, or $48.8 million, 54.9 percent less than in the same period in 1981.

There had been widespread reports among Senate staff aides that a bankruptcy bill would be brought to the floor last Wednesday and then again today. But the threat of a filibuster by Senator Howard M.  Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, apparently deterred the Republican leadership from bringing up the bill. Senator Metzenbaum opposes efforts by the consumer credit lobby to cut down on what it sees as abuses by bankrupt debtors."

Now only 44 apartments of the 234 remain to be rented, and Rockrose has established the northern fringe of the far West Village as a location that can command luxury rents."

The group did agree to raise its official production ceiling to a total of 18.5 million barrels a day, from the largely ignored 17.5 million limit set last March. The adjustment was an attempt to bring the official level more closely in line with actual production, currently estimated at 19.5 million barrels.   They also reaffirmed their commitment to the $34-a-barrel base price - a level set in October 1981 but undercut both on the spot market and by members offering discounts, as an oversupply of oil developed. But without allocating production among the countries, analysts believe it is virtually impossible for OPEC to enforce the overall production limit intended to defend that official price."

The President, the officials say, took the step without any conviction that it would be duplicated by the United States' allies in Western Europe or that it would produce an early improvement of conditions in Poland.   The officials also said that Mr. Reagan, in deciding to cut off the most-favored-nation tariff status, had seized on one of the few levers left to him, to show his anger at the banning of the Solidarity union on Friday.   In briefing reporters, the officials said the loss of the status would have only minimal effect on either Poland or the United States.  Although one official said that ''it is very clear the Soviet Union bears a major responsibility for the situation in Poland,'' he added that no further sanctions were planned against Moscow. This is because any new sanctions against the Soviet Union would almost inevitably have to include an embargo on United States grain exports."

President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt harshly criticized the Israeli action, although his remarks fell far short of the demands by Egyptian opposition parties for a break in relations between Israel and the only Arab nation to recognize it.   After Christian Phalangist militiamen killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians in September at the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in the Israeli-occupied Beirut area, Mr. Mubarak recalled the Egyptian Ambassador, Saad Mortada, from Tel Aviv."

The floor of a drugstore collapsed as firemen fought a stubborn five-alarm blaze that engulfed three buildings on Broadway near 23d Street. Twelve men died.   The charred buildings long stood empty, but eventually they were demolished. The land became part of a 28,000-square-foot site that the owner, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, put on the market. The plot is on the east side of Broadway from 22d Street to 23d Street."

However, American and European analysts noted that it might be some time before Sudanese troops actually arrived in the war zone. At the moment Iranian and Iraqi troops are locked in combat in the mountains east of Baghdad, Iraq's capital.   Iraq claims to have stifled a series of Iranian offensives that began Thursday night and to have begun successful counterattacks.

The new cars, in many respects a return to Detroit's essence, mark a turn away from the industry's emphasis in recent years on the virtues of economy and value. But American car buyers under the age of 35 have defected to imports in disproportionate numbers, industry analysts point out, and Detroit is betting that models stressing youthful values can win them back.   There has been a belated recognition in Detroit ''that they are losing young buyers,'' said Maryann N. Keller, an industry analyst with Paine, Webber, Mitchell Hutchins. ''The son no longer automatically buys what his father drove,'' she said. ''There are no more Buick families.''"

Representatives of the United States Conference of Mayors and various members of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition held separate news conferences today to urge quick passage of measures to hold prices down, reflecting what appears to be increasing concern from constituents about soaring bills.   The cost of natural gas ''has created a national emergency,'' asserted Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who spoke in support of a coalition-sponsored bill introduced today. The measure, among other things, would require gas pipelines to supply the least expensive gas available even if it meant voiding existing supply contracts."

Mr. Levenson has sent out a lot of messages in a quarter century of writing advertising copy at Doyle Dane, penning them on behalf of such folks as Volkswagen, Mobil, Sara Lee and Clairol. These days, he has responsibility for Doyle Dane's creative work on the international scene."

BATTLE,"  The decade-long saga of the battle of Raymond L. Dirks with the Securities and Exchange Commission begins a new chapter today.  Mr. Dirks, widely known for his role in exposing a fraud at the Equity Funding Corporation in 1973, is scheduled to go to trial on civil charges of securities fraud stemming from an underwriting by John Muir & Company of $6 million of Cayman Islands Reinsurance Corporation securities.   According to the commission, Cayman Re, as the company is known, agreed to invest $1.6 million of the money raised through the sale of the securities in highly speculative, newly issued stocks underwritten by Muir and recommended by Mr. Dirks, the general partner who made Muir one of the flashiest firms on Wall Street before its financial collapse in August 1981.   The S.E.C. charged that Mr. Dirks and others had employed ''devices, schemes or artifices to defraud'' in connection with the purchase and sale of securities of Cayman Re beginning in December 1980. Muir was ordered liquidated by a Federal District Court judge after the firm fell below the New York Stock Exchange's minimum net capital requirements."

But the outward vitality of the three-century-old institution masks the extent of the damage that has recently been done to Lloyd's by the wave of scandals involving some of its best-known participants.  The scandals involve accusations of the misappropriation of tens of millions of dollars in premiums and the possibility that some insurance risks had been resold to shadowy offshore firms with insufficient capital to cover them.

There won't be enough time - with Congress devoting much of what's left in the special session to committee assignments and other administrative housekeeping chores.

In those five and a half years, Pakistani and Western officials here say, the Zia Government has given this strategically important country a stability it has not often known during its 35-year history and has brought about an economic revival that has produced a growth rate in real gross national product of 6 percent a year. The Government also says it has gone some distance toward creating a fusion of Islamic and democratic principles that, if brought to fruition, would give the country a distinct new identity.

When revolution and civilization intruded in the 1920's and 1930's, Karl Osipovich moved his dwindling community of Old Believers farther into the primeval taiga until it was only he, his wife and two children who pressed on deeper and deeper into the uninhabited forest.   They stopped on a rugged hillside near the headwaters of the Abakan River, in the Sayan Mountains of southern Siberia, 200 miles from any major human settlement. There, augmented by another daughter and son, the clan scrounged a primitive existence from the brutal land and lived their rigid faith until recently discovered by the outside world.   The children had grown to adulthood in a world bordered by a day's march from their crude hut, conscious of civilization only through the tattered prayer books they learned to read and the dire teachings of the father that the world out there was rife with sin, temptation and godless men."

For the 92 state-chartered savings banks in New York, aggregate operating losses increased to $331.5 million in the third quarter, from $301.9 million in the second. But the third-quarter loss was somewhat less than that of $369.9 million posted a year earlier.   Despite the continuing large losses, the outlook for the savings banks is somewhat rosier because of the drop in interest rates and new legislation that permits the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to inject capital into savings institutions whose surplus accounts - the amount by which their assets exceed their liabilities -are being eroded by operating losses."

According to the letter, Congress has given the Fed authority to enforce the Glass-Steagall Act with respect to national banks. The act provides that a national bank's charter may be forfeited if a violation of the act continues for 6-months after a warning from the Fed and the bank could be fined $1,000 a day."

Although this ''test of readiness'' was staged for the benefit of visitors, the new bullet holes in the walls of this small border village, l25 miles north of Managua, offered evidence that such alarms were also part of real life.   Less than half a mile away, the narrow Guasaule River marks the Nicaragua-Honduras border.

Last April it closed a jeans plant in Laredo, Tex.   The company's profits, which fell 46 percent in the May quarter from a year earlier, partly because of the sluggish economy and poor sales, improved substantially in the August quarter but still were 17 percent below 1981.   To be sure, the jeans industry is going through difficult times.  And according to Jay J. Meltzer, apparel analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company, Levi Strauss is ''just trimming its sails - getting rid of overhead and becoming a lean and mean company in a tough business.'' The market for jeans today is ''much tougher,'' he noted. Unit sales will fall 4.5 percent this year, he estimated, and future growth will be ''quite modest.''"

Department economists said that while inflation and interest rates might decline further next year, there was little chance that farmers' profits would be greater than this year's. In 1982, net farm income is expected to fall to $19 billion, from $25 billion in 1981. The economists made their remarks at the department's annual outlook conference."

The implication for American business executives, a Western economist said, is that ''this may be the time to survey the market'' rather than to embark on new investment.   For, like many other OPEC members, Nigeria has been caught in a recession caused by the abundance of oil on world markets, the increased proportion of competitive non-OPEC oil available to buyers, improved energy conservation in the West and the general slowdown in Western economies.   Nigeria is America's second-largest supplier of imported oil after Saudi Arabia and a substantial buyer of United States foodstuffs. Its income has been steadily falling since 1980, when production of highpriced oil was the main element in export earnings of more than $26 billion. The projection for this year among Western economists is that export earnings will be about $16 billion."

The National Commission on Social Security Reform estimates that $150 billion to $250 billion additional revenues will be needed between now and 1990. This is the short-term funding problem, and although this amount is not small it can be raised.  Prof. Bergmann suggests taxing Social Security benefits; I agree with that suggestion."

The human rights issue has recently taken on added importance because the Reagan Administration is considering lifting a 1976 embargo on arms shipments to Chile. To do so, the White House first has to certify to Congress that the Government here has made ''significant progress'' in ending abuses.   Some progress is apparent to a visitor returning to the country after an absence of many months. Opposition to the Government of Gen.

These questions arise after 10 days of discussions with foreign diplomats here and of carefully supervised visits to various fronts, all inactive or nearly so. Some answers can be found in parts of the military situation.

A panoply of reasons contributing to the decline in organized labor's fortunes have been well documented, and not denied by their leaders, at least quietly. But despite these adversities, there is little reason to predict that labor's power will substantially wane during the coming years, or that the basic adversarial foundations of its policies will change much."

But while the action makes Mexico something of a fire sale in vacation terms, some travel agents predict that Americans would nonetheless shy away for awhile from what they perceive as a financially shaky situation.   Industry officials point out that even though the new market rate for the peso is now in line with black market rates that have prevailed since August, when Mexico imposed exchange controls, Americans have not exactly flocked to Mexico.   ''In the short run, people might tend to stay away,'' said David Hillman, vice president of marketing and administration at Thomas Cook Travel. ''They don't want to worry about Government stability and currency problems. They don't understand the impact of devaluation on them when they travel.''"

But in the latest quarter, ended Oct. 31, the company also took a one-time charge of $428 million for the discontinuance of the 336-store Woolco chain in the United States and the sale of the company's 52.6 percent interest in British Woolworth. Those operations also produced an after-tax loss of $14 million in the quarter before their disposal, bringing the total to $442 million."

DeLorean, in trying to start a new auto company, operated through a tangled web of corporations, here and abroad, attracting financing from such blue-ribbon sources as the British Government and the Bank of America, and fending off questions from business associates and the Internal Revenue Service about how the money was spent.   Federal investigators say Mr. DeLorean had apparently exhausted his legitimate financing sources, but was still determined to make his sports car venture a success. As a result, they said, the 57-year-old businessman turned his entrepreneurial quest toward a more risky but potentially more lucrative source.   Mr. DeLorean, whose flamboyant life landed him on the society pages as often as on the financial pages, was arraigned yesterday in Los Angeles on charges of financing a $24 million cocaine deal with two Californians.   On Tuesday, shortly before his arrest, the British Government announced that DeLorean Motor Cars Ltd., the Northern Ireland-based maker of luxury sports cars, would be permanently closed after being in receivership for eight months."

After years of deficits, a near bankruptcy and a budgetary crisis that shook the municipal credit markets and brought Albany and Washington to the rescue with loan guarantees and financial aid, the nation's premier city had put its books in order and balanced its budget a year ahead of schedule. The Big Apple seemed ready at last to loosen its belt and begin restoring crucial services and even expanding them.   But the good times were short-lived. This week, a subdued Mayor Koch warned his city that economic forces beyond his control had created new budget gaps of $341 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 and an alarming $1.3 billion deficit for the next fiscal year."

At a brief ceremony at the palace of King Juan Carlos on the outskirts of Madrid, the 40-year-old Mr. Gonzalez placed his hands on a Bible and, facing a cruficix, took the oath to the Constitution, using the secular word ''promise'' rather than the religiously laden ''swear'' used by his predecessors. Mr. Gonzalez, the youngest Prime Minister in Europe, is a nonpracticing Roman Catholic.   After taking the oath, Mr. Gonzalez formally communicated to Juan Carlos the names of the 17 men who will make up his Cabinet, which will be sworn in Friday."

Although oil company officials and industry analysts say they do not expect shortages to occur, they also say that the relatively short supplies of refined heating fuel are pushing up retail prices.   In large part, the reduced level of heating oil stocks reflects the changing economics of the oil industry. With crude oil in generous supply, and with consumption declining because of the recession and conservation measures, the oil industry has scaled back the use of its refineries and is attempting to hold down the cost of keeping refined products in storage."

By twos and threes they trudged across bare fields to the neat, white schoolhouses. Not an unusal sight in the West. But here in Iraq it was a testament to the introduction of universal education by President Saddam Hussein - a program for which he will be remembered long after the ubiquitous posters bearing his face are torn down and replaced by those bearing another visage.   The size of the country and the unreliability of communications militate against political conformity, but President Hussein is trying anyway. Posters showing him in uniform, holding a baby, smoking a cigar, grave in a business suit are everywhere. This is a cult of personality Stalin might have envied. But they are pictures.  For security reasons, few Iraqis ever see their leader in person."

Combined with a joint effort by six United States banks to furnish $600 million in loans to get Brazil past the end of the year, the actions are giving the United States more leverage in Brazil than it has enjoyed in more than a decade.   In years past, Brazilian leaders have contended that the country was managing its massive foreign debt with a prudence that forestalled the need to resort to the International Monetary Fund.  And the architects of its foreign policy altered the pattern of its trade and diplomatic initiatives to emphasize underdevelopednations and reduce dependence on the United States."

On Oct. 26 Mr. Sharon told the three-member board of inquiry that the question of the Phalangists' entrance into the camps had not come up at the Tuesday night meeting, and that neither had the broader question of the Phalangists' role in the planned Israeli sweep into West Beirut after Mr. Gemayel's assassination.

Andropov, who surprised Washington by the speed with which he outmaneuvered rivals for the Soviet Communist Party leadership, is regarded here as a tougher, smarter, shrewder competitor for the United States than Leonid I.

His first speech, emphasizing Soviet military might, was read here as an expected show of forcefulness, an echo of Mr. Brezhnev's final theme, and a political bow to the important constituency of the armed forces at the vulnerable moment of succession. Washington is looking for a more definitive outline of policies in the coming days.   On the record, the new Soviet leader is seen by American specialists as a man of contradictions, a cultivated and fairly well traveled party careerist personally fascinated by Western society but concerned that Soviet society has become too corrupt and consumerminded, a strong advocate of the Soviet military buildup but a backer of negotiations with the West who has warned on occasion that detente was in danger and required ''constant movement forward.''"

Still others - though a notable minority - d o not see the Russians as much of a threat at all.  The higher levels of defense spending desired by the President are impressive. Between the fiscal years 1981 and 1987, outlays would grow almost 15 percent a year. The increase in the fiscal year 1983 alone will be almost $34 billion. For perspective, this far exceeds the entire amount of the President's originally recommended 1983 spending levels for housing assistance ($8.9 billion), food stamps ($10.3 billion), and Aid to Families with Dependent Children ($6.9 billion)."

Although many in the Administration have supported the idea of coal slurry pipelines, the White House has until recently shown no sign of retreating from President Reagan's statement last November that the Federal Government should not give pipeline sponsors the eminent domain authority they need to to build them. This is a matter that should be left to individual states, he said.   Coal slurry legislation is opposed by railroads, which are both coal-carrying competitors and the owners of land that would have to be crossed, and by Western interests who argue that slurry lines would deplete water resources."

Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said that the Administration's policy toward El Salvador remained unchanged and that President Reagan was committed to ''political, economic, social reforms taking place within the ongoing democratic process in that country.'' Mr. Speakes said the Administration sought ''quiet diplomacy as a more effective form of diplomatic relations than public discussion of bilateral relations.''   Mr. Speakes's comments, in response to reporters' questions, came after the disclosure that President Reagan and White House aides had been upset about a recent speech in San Salvador by Mr. Hinton, who bluntly criticized the Salvadoran legal system and said that rightist death squads posed as much of a threat to El Salvador as leftist guerrillas. The speech had been cleared by the State Department, but not the White House. ''Most ambassadorial remarks are not,'' Mr.  Speakes said."

The key economic issue facing all nations today is how to break that spiral and get back on a path of steady growth. But there are sharp disagreements among governments on how to proceed.   High unemployment in the industrial world, the most severe since the Depression of the 1930's, is increasing pressure on governments to pursue ''beggar my neighbor'' policies, excluding foreign goods or devaluing currencies to save jobs at home, whatever the consequences for other nations. Suffering and Instability   Disputes between industrialized countries and developing countries have grown worse as the developing nations see the prices of their commodities fall and the incomes of many of their people depressed to - or below -the subsistence level."

The 27-year-old program is the most hotly disputed city housing policy since the urban renewal of the 1950's and 1960's.   Broadly stated, the question is whether J-51 tax benefits have rehabilitated residential buildings that otherwise would have decayed or whether they have largely resulted in subsidies for luxury dwellings, displacing low- and moderate-income renters."

Agreement on the final resolutions for 13 programs - including activities in science, education, culture and development - was by consensus, without a vote.   In their closing statements, delegations from the industrial nations and the third world, after clashing frequently during the debate, all voiced reservations about some aspects of the plan, as did the Soviet delegation, which by and large had sided with the third world.   The texts adopted today will serve as the basis for efforts by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal, Unesco's Director General, to work out a precise program for 1984 and 1985. The program will have to be approved by Unesco's General Assembly next summer, and some of the arguments will undoubtedly be resumed then."

The immediate result of the decision, a temporary denial of a request by a subsidiary of the Panhandle Eastern Corporation for a waiver of its set rates, was to prevent consumer rate increases from taking effect Monday. The affected consumers are mainly in five Middle Western states, including 700,000 in Illinois.   Although imports of Algerian natural gas account for only a small part - less than 1 percent - of the nation's gas supplies, today's move was part of a significant recent effort by Federal regulators to hold gas prices down. Algerian natural gas currently costs about $7 per 1,000 cubic feet, versus an average price of about $2.27 for domestically produced gas, and the importer had sought a rate increase to reflect this differential."

Despite assertions by Israeli officials during the last 10 days that the Beirut Government has endorsed a working paper setting forth Israel's main points, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon is reported to have failed, in a trip to Beirut late last week, to get a Lebanese signature on the document.   And officials here now say that Moslem figures in the Lebanese Government, including Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan and others, are resisting key elements of an accord for fear it would damage Lebanese ties with the rest of the Arab world, just at a time when considerable infusions of oil money are needed for economic recovery and reconstruction. Informed officials in Jerusalem expect the talks to take at least two months, and possibly much longer. U.S. Viewed as Dubious   In addition, there is a vague sense in Israeli political circles that the United States is somewhat cool to Israel's desire for an immediate accord on normalization, fearing that it would contribute to further internal strife in Lebanon, which could open opportunities to the Soviet Union for renewed influence there."

His first round of political appointments and speeches did provide some tantalizing clues about his style and blueprint for the future, but often they raised as many questions as they answered.   How a career officer of the security police in the small Transcaucasian republic of Azerbaijan became a prospective Prime Minister of the Soviet Union, why the position of Soviet President remains vacant and what shape Mr. Andropov's ruling Politburo will take were questions to which the public record could provide only fragmentary hints."

When one well-known public figure did just that, he was disqualified from further consideration, according to two researchers at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business who recently studied the do's and don't's, truths and myths, of the corporate board room.  For their study, Paul M. Hirsch, an associate professor of sociology, and Thomas L. Whisler, professor of business policy, talked with 75 directors of large companies. Because women directors with experience in business are much in demand but short in supply, all but a handful of the directors studied were men."

A deductible in the insurance business is a provision requiring the policyholder to absorb losses up to an agreed-upon amount. Insurance companies charge less for policies with deductibles because they do not have to handle so many small claims.   This year's Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act took on two individual deductible areas, personal casualty and theft losses and medical expenses. In both cases, the Government will share less of this cost and more tax dollars will thereby go to Washington."

In the first test of opinion since the selection of Chancellor Helmut Kohl 10 days ago, his national Free Democrat coalition partners continued the downward slide in popularity that had encouraged them to desert Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic-led Government last month.   But the radical Green antinuclear protest movement, which appears to have displaced the Free Democrats as West Germany's third party, failed to win the 5 percent of the popular vote that would have gained it representation in the 204-member Bavarian assembly.   According to official results, Mr. Strauss's Christian Social Union, the Bavarian branch of the Christian Democrats, took 58.3 percent of the vote, or 133 seats; the Social Democrats, 31.9 percent, or 71 seats; the Greens, 4.6 percent, and the Free Democrats, 3.5 percent."

Currently, he said, the Lebanese Army has four brigades, but only about half of the soldiers are at any given time prepared for action. The goal, they said, is to bring them quickly to 75 percent effectiveness and later to as close to 100 percent as possible.

In June, the United States Supreme Court struck down an Illinois state law regulating corporate takeovers.

It took national office three days later, ending decades of conservative rule.

And one becomes convinced once again that of the multitude of problems in today's world the main problem, the one that stands out, is that of averting the threat of nuclear war.   Virtually everyone agrees that world developments have been evolving in an alarming way. People are asking themselves whether the insane arms race can be halted and the slipping toward the abyss prevented.   Those are legitimate questions. The Soviet Union is adamantly convinced that peace, which is the greatest universal value, can and must be preserved. And it must be a just peace."

In addition, the future of the American bases in Greece is being negotiated by American and Greek representatives.

The official, Francis J. West, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intern@ational Security Affairs, said Iran had been paying North Korea partly in cash and partly in oil.   Military analysts, who provided details at Mr. West's request, said North Korea had provided about 40 percent of the approximately $2 billion worth of weapons, ammunition and equipment Iran acquired abroad this year. Ignoring OPEC Guidelines   To pay for the arms imports, oil industry analysts said, Iran has increased its oil production beyond the limits set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. They said it had also cut prices below those of OPEC and established the guns-for-oil bartering arrangement with North Korea. North Korea has maintained good relations with Moscow and with Peking and has accepted military aid from both. North Korea, according to Andrew J.

Although Europe's unemployment rate of 10.3 percent roughly equals that of the United States, the European countries' tightly woven social security systems mean that there is no talk of anyone's going hungry or being turned out into the cold.   In Britain, for instance, the benefits for those who are thrown out of work go far to make up for their lack of a paycheck. A similar structure of organized aid exists in West Germany, at least for workers who had long employment records before being laid off.   At the same time, however, there is deep concern that Europe has fallen so far behind in creating new markets and is so bound to expensive social service mechanisms that it does not have the same capacity as the United States or Japan to lift itself out of the recession."

From one point of view, ''the watchmaking industry is in a fundamentally healthy state,'' as Ulrich Spycher, chairman of Societe Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlogere, the group that makes Omega, Tissot and, in the United States, Hamilton watches, said in a recent interview. Indeed, Swiss watchmakers, in the rugged Jura Mountains, have managed to remain at timekeeping's technological cutting edge, and exclusive houses - like Piaget, Patek Philippe and a dozen others that produce luxury timepieces for the gilded set in New York or Riyadh, Saudi Arabia -are flourishing.   Last year, the industry shipped $2.1 billion worth of watches abroad, more than 90 percent of production, according to Theo Radja, chief economist at the Watch Industry Association here. Their high added value, he said, puts them among Swiss industry's most lucrative foreign exchange earners."

The move is expected to stir criticism from leftist and nationalist groups that have pledged to fight any efforts by the one-month-old Government of President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado to reverse or weaken the state takeover of the banking system.   But the proposal, contained in a bill sent to Congress Monday night, does not contemplate returning shares to the former bank owners. It would offer them for purchase by Federal, state and municipal agencies, bank workers and bank users. No single shareholder would be allowed to own more than 1 percent of the stock in the banks."

Botha and the leaders of four tiny black states that have taken the nominal independence South Africa offers its former tribal reserves, the Government was said to have committed itself to a new development strategy that stressed interdependence rather than separation.   It was not necessary to travel far from the spacious Union Buildings, the seat of the South African Government, where the red carpet had been rolled out for the leaders of the black states, to find a test case for the new approach and for a long-promised development bank that is now supposed to give it practical content.   One of southern Africa's largest squatter colonies, a dense warren of mud block structures with sheet metal roofs, is only about 16 miles and half an hour away, at the edge of a standard black township that is itself separated by several miles from the affluent white suburbs.   Known as Winterveld, the squatter colony houses blacks of uncertain legal status in an area of fewer than 40 square miles: about 120,000 of them, if you accept the official count; three to four times as many, if you go by the estimates of churchmen who have been active in the area."

ECONOMISTS seldom address ethical questions as they impinge on e conomic theory or economic behavior. They (and I) find the subject c omplex and elusive in comparison with the relative precision and o bjectivity of economic analysis.

Sadly, Trieste ponders one more blow from history, which has reduced it from being the only - and flourishing - port of the vast Austro-Hungarian empire to a backwater of Italy.   The Yugoslavs stopped coming on Oct. 17, ''black Sunday'' for the extensive retail economy that existed here and in the border town of Gorizia, 26 miles to the north, to satisfy a large consumer market that had money but a limited supply of attractive goods on which to spend it. On that day the Yugoslav Government, owing more than $20 billion to Western creditors, decided to limit the outflow of private money."

But New Jerusalem, site of a reported apparition of the Virgin Mary in October 1973, has suddenly become famous throughout the country, not because of its miracles but because Mexican news organizations have chosen to denounce those in charge of the shrine as charlatans, asserting they use violence, sex and extortion to promote their faith.   The particular targets of the attacks are 72-year-old Nabor Cardenas, an unfrocked priest who is referred to as Papa Nabor, and 16-year-old Arcadia Garcia, who claims to receive messages from the Virgin Mary and is known here as Mama Maria de Jesus.

While many consumers will benefit from higher returns on their federally insured accounts, many also might have to pay more for their credit as a result of the pending changes.   ''It's going to be a mixed blessing for the consumer,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, senior vice president and chief economist for the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''For savers, it will offer an opportunity to obtain higher rates than before, but it will result in higher rates for borrowers because, obviously, it means banks' cost of money will be higher than it otherwise would be.''

Holiday shoppers, who could give merchants at least 25 percent of annual sales and as much as 50 percent of profits, are perhaps more crucial now than in quite some time. In simple terms, the issue is whether the stimulus of income tax cuts and supply-side economics can outweigh the drag of the highest jobless rate in decades and a recent slew of unfavorable economic indicators.   Ever the optimists, retailers see the season's prospects ranging from moderately good to very promising. ''A year ago, we stumbled into the season with sluggish sales and high inventories,'' said a top department store executive. ''This tied up our dollars so that we couldn't capitalize on market opportunities to attract shoppers. This year, caution was the word on expenses and inventory accumulation so that we have the financial flexibility to move quickly. Besides, a tight belt and some hunger has made us better businessmen.''"

In downtown Madrid today, workers were pulling down election paraphernalia and putting up posters heralding the arrival of ''Juan Pablo'' - the ''witness of hope,'' they called him.

Cleary, president, chairman and chief architect of the House of Heileman, has made sure that one piece of paper does not get lost among the stacks.   Hung prominently in a simple frame on the wall, between an overstuffed teddy bear and a collection of empty beer bottles and cans, is Mr. Cleary's favorite quotation: ''On the plains of hesitation bleach the bones of countless millions who at the dawn of decision sat down to wait and waiting died.''   Hesitation certainly has not been a problem for the 49-year-old Mr. Cleary since he took over the reins at G. Heileman Brewing Company a dozen years ago. During those years, Heileman, largely through acquisitions, rose to fourth place from No.15 in the highly competitive and shrinking beer industry and, according to analysts, will capture about 7.8 percent of the national market this year."

The index, which is intended to forecast future economic trends, has now risen in five of the past six months and is up 4.2 percent since March.

New history texts for primary schools are just off the presses and a hotly competitive race is on among several publishing houses, each with its own team of historians, to see who can be first with historical surveys for high school and university students.

Canada, this nation's biggest trading partner, and Australia have objected to a provision in a bill pending before the House that would suspend new foreign uranium contracts after uranium imports exceeded 37.5 percent of total domestic demand. The provision emerged from a House-Senate compromise on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission authorization bill, which passed the Senate last Friday and is awaiting action by the House.   The provision is designed to assist the ailing domestic uranium industry but, according to Canadian and Australian officials, it would disturb the international uranium market. American trade officials argue, moreover, that such a trade policy would undermine American efforts to combat protectionism and might invite retaliation."

Mrs. Rauch, a slight, soft-spoken 32-year-old schoolteacher and mother of two, seems more at ease in a heavy sweater and coveralls on her farm near here than on the political stump.   But in state elections in Hesse Sept. 26, a wave of discontent with the country's three established parties and their seemingly insensitive treatment of environmental issues helped the Greens, an alliance of amateur populist politicians, environmentalists and proponents of disarmament and neutralism in Central Europe, to win 22 percent of the vote in Frankenberg. Mrs. Rauch, the local Green candidate, became one of nine Green legislators who now hold the balance of power in the Hesse state parliament.   But the sweeping gains for Mrs. Rauch's party, which was unknown in her electoral district a year ago, helps explain how it has displaced for the moment the small Free Democratic Party as the state's third-largest political force. It was the Free Democrats whose break with Helmut Schmidt over welfare policy led to the Chancellor's ouster by Parliament Friday and the election of Helmut Kohl as his successor."

Catherine Carmany, for one, w ould like to know. At 29, the New York suburban housewife now c ontrols a nest egg that her parents put into trust for her years a go. The Wall Street bank that manages her money has it invested e ntirely in stocks, however, and Mrs. Carmany would like more d iversity. She would also like to be ''a little involved,'' she said.   Her father, an elderly stockbroker who lives in another city, has suggested that she find herself an investment adviser. How to do so is the problem. ''I know there's somebody out there who would be interested in doing something with my money,'' she said, ''but I've asked everybody I know, and nobody knows anybody. Some connection seems to be missing.'' If a number of people might like to be in Mrs. Carmany's shoes, there are also many who share her complaint. Selecting a personal investment adviser would appear to be about as difficult as choosing a surgeon.   Many people regard the whole array of investment advisers with suspicion. For one thing, it is doubtful that the adviser shares one's own reverence for his hard-earned money. For another, the question inevitably arises: If they're so good at investing other people's money, why aren't they just multiplying their own?"

Andropov as General Secretary of the Communist Party believe that he wants to make an early beginning on a tightening of discipline through the whole of Soviet society, to lessen inefficiency and waste that caused widespread disillusionment in the last years of Leonid I. Brezhnev's tenure.   The expectation of a tougher approach is also widespread among ordinary Russians, and it could mean an even more extensive crackdown on the dissident movement than the one Mr. Andropov presided over during his 15 years as head of the K.G.B., the intelligence and internal-security agency. In addition, it probably heralds a drive to curb the absenteeism, slothfulness and heavy drinking that have contributed to the country's chronic economic problems. But it could also mean some changes that many think are badly needed."

Viscount Etienne Davignon, the Commissioner of Industry for the European Economic Community, said at a news conference that foreign suppliers would be asked to accept a smaller share of Europe's shrinking market, just as Americans had demanded that European producers reduce their share of the United States market.   Foreign ministers of the market's 10 members are expected to approve the reduction in imports at a meeting in Luxembourg Monday, Viscount Davignon said.

He said Chrysler had operating earnings in the United States in exess of $20 million, but would not specify the exact amount. The company's tax payment of $21.3 million, however, suggests domestic earnings of about $45 million."

With the nimbleness acquired in 20 years spent handling executive searches for Fortune 500 companies, he simply shipped over a candidate who proved to have ''stronger interpersonal skills.'' As a result, he pocketed his standard fee: one-third of the executive's first year total compensation, usually salary and bonus, paid even if a company does not hire one of his candidates.

Sometimes they are singing, often they walk arm-in-arm, not infrequently they are drunk. They are almost exclusively Japanese businessmen. They give Tokyo's night life the look and feel of one big, sprawling fraternity party. In unliberated Japan, few women are included."

But with the campaign just over three months old, Western and Somali sources said, the invaders have failed to achieve a decisive success and General Siad Barre appears to have weathered yet another threat to his 13-year-old presidency.   The effort to bring down the general's autocratic, pro-Western Government began on June 30, when Somali dissidents in the Somali Democratic Salvation Front, backed by a strong, mechanized force of Ethiopian troops, crossed the long-disputed Somali-Ethiopian border and seized two small towns, Galdogob and Balanballe."

LIVINGSTON,"  This is the land where David Livingstone lies buried and where, too, the great evangelical effort of the Scottish missionary and his peers has stamped itself indelibly on a nation once steeped in Africa's animism.   Three out of every four of Zambia's six million people profess adherence to one Christian church or another, and Livingstone is still venerated in the town named after him, at the Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River, and in the modest shrine to the north where he finally succumbed to disease, thousands of miles from home.   But the legacy, these days, of the early evangelists is tainted by schisms and debates among their successors that have pitted, in one case, a black laity against white clerics, and, in others, have brought allegations of misdeeds, sorcery and illicit liaisons among the priesthood.   The divisions are such, according to an analyst of church affairs, that a threat has arisen of a formal schism between Zambia's Roman Catholics and the Vatican that would add to the ranks of southern Africa's 2,000 separatist churches. Africa's Spiritual Realities   The debate has also evoked the wider conflict between the forms of religion imposed by outsiders and an African desire to remodel the church in a manner perceived as more suited to the continent's spiritual realities."

While continuing to stress that the Soviet Union has an advantage in these missiles and that the decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to counter them with the new American missiles is justified, Mr. Mitterrand is now also saying that the solution may be in a compromise.   Until recently, France had given no indication that its attitude varied from the Atlantic alliance position supporting the ''zero solution'' advanced by the Reagan Administration.

Victories over the Syrian Army and Air Force and the virtual elimination of the Palestine Liberation   Organization as a military threat appear to be modified by doubts about the wisdom of the last phases of the military operation and their effect upon American public opinion.   Recent conversations with junior Israeli officers at the front in Lebanon and with senior officers in Israel and elsewhere indicate that there was enough questioning among officers and men about a final and probably costly thrust into West Beirut to affect the command decision not to make such an attack while the guerrillas were still there in force. Sources at a command level say they do not think American pressure for an agreement for the departure of the P.L.O. fighters had anything to do with the decision not to mount an all-out attack.

The changes reported so far involve the Nanjing, Canton and Chengdu military regions. There are rumors that as many as six to eight of China's 11 military regions could end up with new commanders."

In this round, it has strong support from the Reagan Administration and Congress, which are disturbed by what they see as the implications of a proposed ''new world information and communication order.'' And, to counter what has been an ideological debate over what some critics see as imbalance in news coverage, the press has taken some practical initiatives recently to improve third-world communications and to increase Western awareness of events in the developing nations.

The session is to set an agenda called the ''medium-term plan'' for Unesco activities during the rest of the decade."

In this light, they commit themselves to reduce trade frictions, overcome protectionist pressures, avoid using export subsidies inconsistent with Article XVI of the GATT and promote the liberalization and expansion of trade.   They are therefore determined to create, through concerted action, a renewed consensus in support of the GATT system, so as to restore and reinforce confidence in its capacity to provide a stable and predictable trading environment and respond to new challenges. Commitment Is Reaffirmed   The contracting parties have accordingly decided: To reaffirm their commitment to abide by their GATT obligations and to support and improve the GATT trading system, so that it may contribute vigorously to the further liberalization and expansion of trade based on mutual commitment, mutual advantage and overall reciprocity and the most-favored-nation clause."

But the nostalgia over 1982 is curdled: The year turned out much worse than expected. Last February, the President's Council of Economic Advisers said in its annual report: ''The current recession is expected to end early in 1982.'' It has still not ended. And a major worry for the coming year is that unemployment, now close to 11 percent, will hang on near that level as employers continue to keep payrolls lean in an effort to operate profitably.   Anxieties are rife - among concerned employers as well as among workers - that technology is making a growing number of people with low skills and inadequate education unemployable."

The fight began with an advertising offensive by Burger King, the No.2 fast-hamburger chain, which has been losing its share of the market to McDonald's, the sales leader, and Wendy's, the fastexpanding No.3 chain.   Taking its cue from other second choices, notably Pepsi-Cola, Burger King, a Pillsbury susidiary, ordered a taste test. Saying the results showed that its burgers were favored over those of its two rivals, Burger King started a $20 million national advertising campaign based on the findings."

The fare increases, which were not announced, were in sharp contrast to the highly publicized discounts on some transcontinental and New York-to-Florida fares that also went into effect this week.  The discounts reduce the one-way fares on these routes to $99 for short periods before and after the Christmas holiday.   The 5 percent increase, which applies to the overwhelming majority of the nation's routes, is the third across-the-board fare rise this year: In July, fares rose $10, and in September, there was a 5 percent increase. Under current deregulation rules, the airlines are able to put increases into effect after notifying the Civil Aeronautics Board."

In order to help troubled companies reorganize and continue operating, bankruptcy courts are empowered to prevent ordinary commercial creditors from disposing of the bankrupt company's assets to which they might otherwise be entitled. Under this so-called turn-over authority, the creditors must return certain assets to the bankrupt company for its use during the reorganization.   But various Federal courts have disagreed over whether this provision also applies to the Internal Revenue Service, which is often a major creditor of a company that is on the verge of bankruptcy. The case the Court accepted today is an appeal by the Internal Revenue Service from a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York."

The effect the move will have on increasing imports will probably be comparatively slight - about $380 million a year, according to an unofficial Government estimate. By comparison, the United States trade defict with Japan is expected to reach a record $19 billion this year."

Gerhard Stoltenberg, the Finance Minister in the new Government headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said at a news conference that the budget provided for 2.9 percent growth and would amount to total Government spending of 253.8 billion marks, or $99.5 billion.   Mr. Stoltenberg said the budget was based on ''economic assumptions that are serious and, for the moment, realistic.'' He said Bonn faced an acute rise in joblessness in coming months that would cut tax revenues and increase welfare costs. Despite an austerity package including higher taxes, welfare payment cuts and reduced subsidies to ailing industries, he said, public borrowing is expected to rise to the equivalent of $16.2 billion from $15.6 billion this year. In July, the former Government, figuring on a brighter economy next year, projected a net credit need of $11.1 billion in 1983."

Thirteen major military contractors and 135,000 workers in plants across the nation have a huge stake in the House of Representatives vote on whether to produce the MX, the missile that President Reagan considers one of the pillars of his Administration's strategic policy.   The Air Force has already spent $4.5 billion on research and development for the MX, which stands for missile experimental, and expects ultimately to spend $26 billion if Congress approves President Reagan's ''dense pack'' basing system. Floor Fight Expected   Nearly $2 billion was directed to the 13 contractors and to scores of subcontractors in the last fiscal year alone. Although Mr.  Reagan's proposal was jeopardized last Thursday when the House Appropriations Committee narrowly defeated an attempt to delete $988 million in MX production money from the military appropriations bill, a floor fight on the missile and its basing mode is expected this week."

Neglecting any and all benefits of mergers, he hastens toward his inevitable call for legal restrictions on mergers.   Lest his indiscriminate analysis cast suspicion on mergers in general, we would like to set the merger record straight.  Because there is no significant antitrust overlap in ''specific markets,'' Mr. Nordhaus reasons that the Bendix merger is a pure ''conglomerate'' merger. All pure conglomerate mergers fall outside antitrust overlap areas. But it does not follow that all mergers that fall outside such areas are pure conglomerate mergers. By making this argument, Mr. Nordhaus effectively ignores the thousands of mergers every year that neither achieve significant gain in market concentration nor fall within the pure conglomerate category."

In a letter to a prominent American Jew, the Vatican defended the meeting as consistent with the Pope's efforts to promote peace and understanding. It said the act of receiving an individual in no way implied approval of his ideas and actions.   The recipient of the letter, Julius Berman, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, criticized the Vatican's position, saying it offered Jews ''no comfort.''"

It stars a much younger, stockier Lang Hancock as himself, a tough talking Australian prospector; the late Tom Price, the right-hand man of the late industralist Henry Kaiser, as the prospector's American sidekick, and A.W. Clausen, then a Bank of America vice president, as the banker who helps the prospector and Kaiser Steel strike a deal to explore and mine the prospector's iron ore El Dorado in the Hamersley Range. The film ends happily with the prospector flying off into the Australian sunset.   Mr. Hancock has reason to get great satisfaction from the film. It depicts his home state of Western Australia as Australia's Texas, a state of open spaces, mineral wealth and unlimited opportunity. It shows an independent, resourceful and unorthodox Lang Hancock demonstrating the John Wayne-like qualities that have made him a business legend in Australia. And it is a testament, in somewhat faded hues, to the legend of the ''lucky country,'' which holds that people e who live here are lucky. Mr. Hancock has reason to believe in that luck."

United States officials traveling with Secretary of State George P.

''As for the subject of the withdrawal of foreign forces, the subject of American shuttles seems to me to be a reasonable solution,'' Mr. Sharon said.   But he also said Israel and Lebanon must eventually hold face-toface negotiations on ''security arrangements and a normalization agreement'' between the two countries."

In past years shareholders had to be especially vigilant about when they took gains, to make sure they were reflected in the desired tax return. Internal Revenue Service regulations had set the fifth business day before year-end as the deadline for stockholders to establish profits on a regular-way basis for their 1982 tax returns.   Now, however, a new ruling by the I.R.S. allows stockholders the option of establishing profits up to year-end that could be taxed in either the current or the coming year. In making this change the I.R.S decided that sales of stock in the last week of a year come under the installment sales law, because payment is made in the later year."

And by Monday morning of that over-extended weekend, he was saying that he had not slept in three nights. He wasn't the only one.   In all, more than 3,000 people -delegates from the 88 nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as well as aides, reporters and camera crews - converged on Geneva Wednesday, Nov. 24, for a meeting scheduled to end by noon Saturday. They expected that the talks aimed at mending the world's battered trade system would be tough - but not as tough as they proved to be. Meetings were held day and night - in full sessions or in subcommittees, in coalition groups or in secretive twosomes - and continued well past Saturday's scheduled close and into Monday's dawn.   The exhaustion was spread all over town. One key set of meetings was held at GATT headquarters, an 18th century-styled chateau, built in the 1920's, overlooking Lake Geneva. In one corner, in a suite of offices with olive green walls, members of the high-powered ''chairman's group'' held 24-hour vigils and were dubbed the ''boys in the green room.''"

Their apprehension has been heightened by a number of reports circulating in Beirut and other parts of the country that the Government is considering a plan to oust all but 50,000 of the more than half a million Palestinians in the country.   Mr. Gemayel, who is allied with the Lebanese Christian forces that have been blamed for the massacres, is still forming his Government, so no action has been taken. But Palestinian civilians, ranging from laborers to skilled professionals, have become alarmed in recent days because hundreds of them have been picked up, by the Lebanese Army for interrogation and identity checks.

Substantial but incomplete returns in Athens and other major cities seemed to reflect some voter disenchantment with the Government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.   The losses for the Socialists mean that they will be forced to depend heavily on Communist support in a runoff poll next Sunday since most of the candidates in urban areas did not win the required 51 percent. Athens Mayor Falls Behind   In Athens, generally a mirror of nationwide opinion, the conservative candidate, Tzanis Tzannetakis, took an early lead over the incumbent Socialist Mayor, Dimitrios Beis, with the Communists running third. If the Communists support the Socialist candidate in the second round, as has been the practice, Mayor Beis would be reelected."

In addition, the resolution has again focused attention on Washington's approach to Japan's industrial policy and on economic policy in the United States.   The Senate backed a petition by Houdaille Industries, a producer of machine tools based in Florida, requesting that a 15 percent investment tax credit for two types of Japanese machine tools be denied. The company's case is an extensively researched argument that the Japanese Government has given its manufacturers an unfair advantage in international markets by forming a domestic cartel and funneling public funds into the industry, and by other measures."

Clashes between demonstrators and the riot police broke out in midafternoon and continued until at least 11 o'clock tonight, with protesters building and setting fire to barricades and the police hurling volleys of tear gas and concussion grenades.   The strike was the first defiance of labor legislation enacted by Parliament on Friday dissolving the union that was formed in 1980 and that for a time claimed the loyalty of nearly 10 million people in this nation of 36 million. Before it was outlawed, the union had been suspended with the declaration of martial law last Dec. 13."

The only employer of any consequence is represented by a sprawling brick edifice of little architectural note beyond its sheer bulk, but the employer in this case is a hotel, the Homestead.   Unlike most old factories, everything works at the Homestead, from the four-sided clock just under the thumb-like dome to the doors of the generous veranda, which are opened and closed, not by some electronic wizardry, but by green-uniformed floor men who align themselves almost invisibly with the hinges. Countless Amenities   The Homestead offers countless amenities for the protection and enjoyment of those who can pay its princely prices, enough even to satisfy men who travel by corporate jet and bring home, many of them, a million dollars a year. One hundred of those men, current and retired chief executives of many of the country's biggest companies, have just spent three days here, each day threatened by rain that they had the luck or authority to defer until most had departed.  Twice a year these men, members of the Business Council, make a pilgrimage here with their wives to ponder the world beyond them in private meetings with high Government officials."

Fedorchuk   For the first time since the early 1950's, the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs came under the control of a career K.G.B. officer yesterday with the appointment of Vitaly V. Fedorchuk to head it.   Since the end of May, Mr. Fedorchuk, 64 years old, had been chief of the K.G.B., rising to that post after more than four decades in internal security work. The appointment as K.B.G. chief also seemed to be a departure, for he was the first professional to head the organization since 1958.   The ruling Politburo had decided against a political appointment in May, a time when events in Poland seemed alarming and a power struggle to succeed the ailing party chief, Leonid I. Brezhnev, appeared to be approaching. Mr. Fedorchuk had headed the K.G.B. in his native Ukraine for 12 years, since July 1970, and the Politburo selected him to take over as chairman at the national organization."

The men in uniform who took over Brazil in 1964 viewed Mr. Brizola as the most provocative figure in the country's public life.

The conflict pits the Minister of Defense and Public Security, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, against Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former national guard intelligence officer and leader of the ultraright National Republican Alliance. At issue, according to foreign diplomats and Salvadoran officials, are attempts by Mr. d'Aubuisson to encourage opposition to General Garcia among army officers and the public in the hope of unseating him,   Such a step would create serious problems for the United States because General Garcia has largely supported American efforts here and has placed the Salvadoran Army behind land redistribution. Mr.  d'Aubuisson, who is president of the Constituent Assembly elected in March, opposes social reform and has been accused of having ties to rightist terrorism here. Western diplomats say Mr. d'Aubuisson's efforts to extend his power and dominate the military would severely weaken, perhaps crush, United States-supported efforts to shape a democratic government."

Israel's previous position was to avoid participating in any semipermanent resettlement of the 30,000 to 60,000 refugees in camps that had once been centers of Palestinian guerrilla activity against Israel.   The Lebanese Government, once also a target of the Palestinians, had a policy similar to Israel's old one. The Lebanese told the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which is directly responsible for the camps, that only tents could be erected for the homeless refugees."

The International Monetary Fund, in a Dec.6 announcement that went virtually unnoticed, reported that industrial world exports had dropped a stunning 10.9 percent between the second and third quarters of the year, far greater than the 2 to 3 percent decline that had been predicted by prominent economists.   Those figures helped to convince Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that the Reagan Administration had to change its posture and support an increase in the I.M.F.'s lending resources.   That policy switch, European officials say, was set in motion last month, when Mr. Volcker asked Lamberto Dini, second in command at the Italian Central Bank, to visit him in Washington. Mr. Dini is chairman of the ''Group of Ten,'' the covey of financial officials that oversees the international monetary system. Mr. Volcker told Mr. Dini that he was worried that private banks were hurriedly cutting back their lending to developing nations. That, he said, could further reduce trade and worsen an already severe recession."

Analysts said the upswing was sparked mainly by the strong performance of the bond market, where long-term Treasury securities rose in price by more than $20 for every $1,000 in face value and yields fell. The bond price rally came after the Federal funds rate, the rate for overnight loans that banks make to each other, dropped early in the day.   ''Helping the rally was the report in the afternoon by the Commerce Department that durable goods orders placed with American factories last month rose 1.9 percent, or more than expected,'' said Leonard Siegel, vice president of investments of Josephthal & Company. The rise was viewed as an indication that an economic recovery might start soon."

This left the December futures at a discount of 131 basis points to the actual Value Line index, which closed at 147.11, down 460 points on the day."

The report, which was circulated by the Lebanese Central Information Agency but not supported by any other source, said that 12 suspects had been seized and that most of them were Moslem Shiites from southern Lebanon. The suspects were also said to include some southern Christians and one person who carried a Jordanian passport.   Israel has said that Phalangists were responsible for the massacre, but the Phalangist-dominated militias known as the Lebanese Forces have repeatedly denied involvement. Maj. Saad Haddad, commander of an Israeli-supported militia in southern Lebanon consisting of both Christians and Moslems, testified at the official inquiry earlier this week that none of his troops had been involved in the killings."

Woolworth Company, he visited a Woolworth's variety store inM anhattan and was shocked by its shabby condition and unattractive m erchandise.   Somehow, that store had fallen between the cracks of Woolworth's multilayered supervision. The store manager explained that he had been too involved in too many duties to pay more attention to the store's housekeeping. As to the merchandise, he conceded that he had been ordering what he ''thought'' his customers wanted rather than trying to learn if they really wanted it. Put on notice to correct the situation, he cleaned up the store, stripped the stock of goods that were not selling and, with the help of Woolworth's central staff, added more desirable merchandise.   Within two years, that store delivered a net profit of $100,000, in contrast to its previous annual net incomes of between $7,000 and $8,000. ''All we did,'' said Mr. Lynn, ''was to clean up the place and give it basic merchandise. Today, that manager runs a bigger store. He's happier. And he even dresses better.''"

Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, today opposed acceleration of the July 1 tax cut, now under consideration by the White House, but endorsed an increase in the gasoline tax to finance a highway repair program.   One effect of Mr. Volcker's comments was to strengthen the move already afoot in Congress to approve, at the special session beginning Monday, an increase in the gasoline tax equal to 5 cents a gallon, bringing the total tax to 9 cents.  President Reagan endorsed the increase yesterday.   But Mr. Volcker's remarks added to the already stiff opposition in Congress to making the scheduled 10 percent cut in personal income taxes effective Jan. 1 instead of July 1. Although Mr. Volcker is often criticized in Congress for thwarting economic recovery by rigid adherence to his anti-inflation program, his views on economic policy carry considerable weight on Capitol Hill."

''Everybody is in love with what they own,'' one trader of Government agency securities said, ''and there has been no significant selling.''   About the worst that could be said of the credit markets at this time is that ''there is some disquietitude that the outlook is so one-sided,'' said Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber Inc. He also expects yields to come down further, but he noted that some investors and traders get nervous when ''everybody starts saying the same thing.''"

Also, if the bonds are held for five years or more, they will pay a minimum rate - 7.5 percent - which will not go down if market rates fall below that level.   Under authority requested by the Administration and given by Congress in the 1982 tax act, the President disclosed these details of a major change in the Savings Bonds program intended to make it more attractive to savers.   The variable rate bonds are also meant to counter criticism that people who buy Savings Bonds for small sums fail to get as good a return as they could realize if they could afford marketable Treasury securities that require a minimum purchase of $1,000."

Rodino Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, today assailed the failure of Congress to meet the Supreme Court's Dec. 24 deadline for restructuring the nation's bankruptcy courts.   Meanwhile, the Justice Department said it would seek an extension of the deadline on Wednesday if it is requested by Congressional leaders, who have said bankruptcy legislation for this session is dead.   Representative Rodino, a New Jersey Democrat, said that the failure of Congress to cure constitutional defects found by the Supreme Court almost six months ago ''blatantly ignored ''a constitutional mandate handed down by the highest court in the land.''"

''Maybe these two things that are being talked about ''would have a 2 to 4 percent impact'' in reducing current bills, Mr. Hodel said.  ''I don't think that's the kind of protection, or help, that is needed.'' He said passage of the legislation could result in ''terribly disappointed'' consumers."

Royco was founded in Britain in the 1960's by Roy Strudwick, and the company does both commercial and residential development.   Mr. Rainbow spent a year traveling across America looking for opportunities to invest before deciding on New York City.  Now the company has a $60 million, 270,000-square-foot luxury office building under construction on 52d Street between Lexington and Third Avenues. It will be finished about June, but by many accounts the market for new office buildings has begun to wither. Mr. Rainbow shows no signs of being worried even though the building, like other new midtown projects, has no tenant yet."

For as a result of severe price cutting since 1978 - especially in commercial, rather than personal, lines where corporate buyers have economic muscle - insurance companies as a group have been reporting steady underwriting losses, or losses from the sale of insurance products. But the earnings from the investments in their portfolios have far surpassed the deficits from price cutting, thereby enabling the industry to post overall profits.   Now the nation's insurers are concerned that the sharp drop in interest rates that began last August will cut their investment income substantially. And without this protective cushion, there is widespread fear that the overall profitability of insurers, which are regulated by the states, will be significantly reduced unless premiums are immediately increased."

Western commercial bankers saw the decision as a sign of official support in case of troubles in unregulated banking centers, such as the Bahamas or Luxembourg, where the banks were expanding rapidly.   Then, after eight years of headway into the unregulated centers, came the collapse last summer of Banco Ambrosiano of Milan, Italy.  The glaring lesson to bankers came when Italy's central bank failed to bail out Ambrosiano's Luxembourg subsidiary, which owed some $400 million to other banks. With that, the bankers' perceptions of official support shattered."

This latest piece of grim industrial news means not only that a major part of the economy continued to decline in October but also, according to some economists, that when recovery comes, many American factories may not be equipped to meet it.   Another troubled sector, the construction industry, took some comfort from a report today showing that while October home starts were up only 1 percent from September, permits for future construction, spurred by lower interest rates, were up 17.7 percent.

Patolichev, said: ''It is necessary for the United States to renounce once and for all the doctrine of using trade as a weapon against our country.''   Without the confidence that agreements would not be broken, Mr.  Patolichev declared, ''no businessman will sign a deal.'' Since 1979, the last year before economic sanctions of one sort or another were imposed, the American share of Soviet machinery imports had dropped to 3 percent from 7 percent, and the United States share of grain imports fell to 17 percent from 71 percent, the minister said. He added that only eight-tenths of 1 percent of Soviet equipment purchases now come from the United States."

Rarely has such uncertainty enveloped a West German election. The voting, promised for March 6 by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, could fundamentally alter the nation's political landscape, but some politicians have mounted a rear-guard action to prevent the election from taking place.   Not surprisingly, reluctance to face the voters is strongest among the small Free Democratic Party, which in September brought down Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic Government by throwing its parliamentary support behind Mr. Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats."

STAFF FAULTS BROKERS IN REPORT ON '80 SILVER CRISIS,"  Six major stock brokerage firms risked losing hundreds of millions of dollars two years ago because they gave excessive credit to the Hunt family of Texas for silver speculation, according to a staff report of the Securities and Exchange Commission that was released today.   The report also criticized the New York Stock Exchange for failing to detect the extent of the potential crisis as it developed.  In the months following the collapse of silver prices in the spring of 1980, regulators and the financial community were generally led to believe that Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc. had borne the greatest losses by extending credit to the Hunts.   But the S.E.C. said that five other firms - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.; Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.; E.F. Hutton & Company; A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc., and Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis Inc. -faced potentially damaging losses."

The time has come, the statement said, for Argentines to stop ''blaming each other'' and ''for each person to accept his part of the responsibility for the grave mistakes and blunders of the past.''    It was a plea that reflected a fear shared by many Argentines: as the military Government of President Reynaldo B. Bignone is moving under pressure to return the country to democracy, many here sense a growing danger that the country will slide into anarchy during the transition.   The country is still mostly peaceful, but adding to Argentines' fears is an awareness that the country has broken down into violence many times in the last 50 years. In the 1970's more than 10,000 people reportedly died or disappeared in political terrorism and military actions to counter the terrorism."

Kevenides, vice president and director of real estate economics and market research at the Chemical Bank. New growth in residential construction is expected, he says, at a time of decline for commercial real estate.   His conclusions are based on results of a computerized real estate forecasting model that analyzes trends in 15 major metropolitan areas of the country.   ''All of the $25 billion increase in construction contracts forecasted for 1983 will occur in the residential sector,'' Mr.  Kevenides said in his report of the study. ''The key factors behind this outlook is a significant amount of overbuilding in most commercial markets accompanied on the residential side by a continued high level of demand, lower interest rates, a decline in consumer debt burden, improved consumer confidence backed by higher income and availability of mortgage funds.''"

America's economic problems were the dominant issue - the only issue - in the landslide Presidential victory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The economy was in collapse and F.D.R. had pledged to create jobs for the nation's 12 million unemployed - while somehow managing to balance the Federal budget. Little did he know then that eventually he would embrace the radical ideas of a Briton named John Maynard Keynes, who advocated huge deficit spending to bring the United States out of its depression.   Now it is election day, 1982. The shattered economy is once again the dominant issue of a national political campaign. Unemployment is at 10.1 percent, not the 24 percent of Roosevelt's era - thanks in large part to the adoption since then of Keynesian policies to cushion an economic decline. Still, hopes for recovery keep moving further into the future, notwithstanding the President's insistence on the campaign trail this fall that his policies will soon restore the economy to buoyant, noninflationary growth.   There are some who share this belief, who think the economy's vitality can be restored by shrinking the relative size of Government and lowering tax rates. And there are others who, doubting this, still think that Keynesian policies remain the basic solution to the nation's economic problems, with some minor modifications to avoid a revival of inflation."
