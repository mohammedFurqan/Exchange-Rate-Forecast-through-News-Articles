The acquisition price represents an 89.2 percent premium, based on Numerical's closing price of $3.70 a share on Friday. Shares of Numerical, which is based in San Jose, Calif., closed yesterday at $6.91, up $3.21, or about 87 percent. Chip-making companies use Numerical's software and other applications to produce integrated circuits with patterns that are smaller than the wavelength of light. Numerical's applications are based on phase-shifting and optical correction technologies that compensate for distortions caused by working in such reduced dimensions. Synopsys, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., makes electronic design automation software. The company expects the deal to speed production of sub-wavelength chips as well as reduce costs and manufacturing risk for customers developing power-efficient integrated circuits. The acquisition requires regulatory approval and other closing conditions. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter.   (Dow Jones/AP) COPYRIGHT ACCORD ON DIGITAL SHARING The recording industry and a coalition of technology companies have reached an agreement in principle to oppose any government-required technologies that would prevent consumers from sharing songs and other digital material.

Sales climbed 2.8 percent. Net income was 2 cents a diluted share, in contrast to a net loss of $5.13 million, or 2 cents a diluted share, in the year-earlier period, the company said yesterday. Revenue rose to $155.3 million from $151 million. First-quarter sales and profit, excluding certain items, will be unchanged from the preceding period, beating analysts' forecasts, the chief financial officer, Marcel Gani, said. Juniper, which trails Cisco Systems in sales of data-traffic routers, had losses in five of the six preceding quarters as customers slashed spending after overbuilding fiber optic networks. Shares of Juniper dropped 33 cents, to $8.90, in after-hours trading. Earlier, shares fell 46 cents, to $9.23, in regular trading.   (Bloomberg News) ADVANCED MICRO POSTS LOSS AFTER CHARGE Advanced Micro Devices, the No. 2 maker of microprocessors, posted a fourth-quarter net loss yesterday after a restructuring charge related to layoffs. The company reported a loss of $854.7 million, or $2.49 a diluted share, compared with a loss of $15.8 million, or 5 cents a diluted share, for the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time items like a $330.6 million restructuring charge, Advanced Micro would have recorded a fourth-quarter per-share loss of 68 cents. On that basis, analysts had on average forecast that Advanced Micro would post a loss of 42 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call. Advanced Micro shares fell 25 cents, to $7.20.   (Reuters) PC SALES INCREASE IN QUARTER Promotions and price cuts provided worldwide personal computer sales with an unexpected increase in the fourth quarter, according to figures released yesterday.

The company's net income rose 72 percent, although most of that was because of a one-time tax gain. Excluding noncomparable items, its income climbed 1.8 percent from the previous year. Operating income in the fourth quarter declined 15 percent from the previous year, as Sears increased its allowance for uncollectible credit card accounts by $150 million. Sears said that decline was offset by 10 percent higher operating income in its retail business, helped by improvements in margin and the acquisition of Lands' End last spring. (AP) FEDERATED TO CLOSE 11 STORES AND CUT 2,000 JOBS Federated Department Stores plans to close 11 stores and cut nearly 2,000 jobs this year, as it expects flat sales and earnings in 2003.

Here are answers to some important questions about the issue.    Q. Who pays the taxes on dividends right now?    A. Any person who owns stock in a company, estate or trust and receives payments of cash, property or stock as a result must pay the tax. The rates are the same as for wages and other income. But individuals who own stock in an individual retirement account or a tax-deferred 401(k) plan only pay income taxes when money is withdrawn, which usually occurs many years after the dividends are paid.
