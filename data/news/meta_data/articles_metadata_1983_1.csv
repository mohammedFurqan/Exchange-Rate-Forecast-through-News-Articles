In a letter to President Reagan, the lawmakers said such a move would help correct the widespread impression among NATO members that Washington is not sincerely committed to arms reduction. And unless that impression is changed, they added, the alliance might have trouble deploying a new generation of medium-range missiles this year.   ''We confront a clear and pressing need,'' the letter said, ''to fortify public confidence throughout the alliance in the rational basis of NATO's deterrent posture.''"

While the value of inventories of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers fell $5.6 billion, to a seasonally adjusted $508.6 billion, their total sales rose 1.2 percent, to $336.37 billion, from $332.54 billion in October, the department said.   That resulted in a sharp plunge in the closely watched inventoryto-sales ratio, which was 1.51 in November, compared with 1.55 in October. The ratio, which measures the number of months it would take to liquidate inventories at the November sales pace, was at its lowest level since July."

Shultz warned today that the Atlantic allies risk fighting a food trade war of ''devastating impact'' unless the Europeans ''take seriously'' Washington's efforts to negotiate an end to export subsidies.   His comments before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee were the strongest yet made by any Administration official about the danger of a trade conflict erupting from farm surpluses and growing pressure to dump the surpluses at cheap prices on world export markets.   Mr. Shultz spoke against a background of mounting resentment in Europe against a sale of one million tons of wheat to Egypt by the United States. The wheat was sold at $155 a ton, which is $25 a ton below the current world market level. This was possible because the sale was subsidized by the American Government."

But the three more weeks of sales remaining, along with two other factors, may still produce respectable profits for the period, retailing consultants and analysts say.   The two additional factors are declining interest rates and corporate programs begun early last year to shore up profit margins through major changes in the mixture of merchandise.   ''A year ago, the prime rate was substantially higher than today's 11 percent, and that means that retailers, as well as many other businessmen, have been paying less for loans on accounts receivable than they were,'' said Robert M. Warner, a management consultant."

The federal Government announced today that, over the next eight years, the rate that farmers pay railroads to transport their grain to eastern markets will likely quintuple, after remaining unchanged since 1897.   At that time, the Crowsnest Pass Agreement between Ottawa and the Canadian Pacific Railway cemented in place a rate per ton-mile of half a cent (which equals about four-tenths of a United States cent) for grain shipments to the east from the central and western prairie provinces.   It is now cheaper for farmers to ship 100 pounds of grain to Thunder Bay, Ontario, on Lake Superior, than it is to mail a 30-cent letter there from the west. Nearly all of Canada's grain is shipped by rail at the Crowsnest rate."

The mark, traditionally Europe's strongest currency, has fluctuated between 2.330 and 2.596 since September, when the Christian Democrats unseated the Social Democrats.   The growing strength of the Social Democrats has worried the business community, while the depressed state of other European currencies gives investors no choice but to remain with the dollar.  Should the Social Democrats gain power, ''there's a general perception that West Germany will be an ungovernable country,'' said Fran,coise Soares, head corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais."

After more than a year of preparation, an outlay of more than $10 million and months of high-brow fanfare, the magazine will start coming off the presses this week.   Its publisher is still Conde Nast, but the august Madison Avenue company is now owned by the Newhouse family, which bought the troubled publishing concern in the late 1950's and brought it to good times in the 1970's. The new Conde Nast has seven successful magazines on its roster, advertising revenues that far outpace the industry's, and enough extra backing from its parent company to be undaunted by the prospect that the new Vanity Fair may, at the start, be a losing proposition."

Prominently displayed on it is the word ''Mazda,'' the trade name for Toyo Kogyo cars, and a symbol depicting the company's unique rotary engine. The union's initials are barely discernible.   Mr. Ohsone's gesture indicates the close links that unions in Japan have with automobile companies. In Detroit, confrontation has marked labor-management relationships ever since members of the United Automobile Workers union sang ''solidarity forever, the union makes us strong'' as they fought to organize and struck for better wages.  In Japan, assembly line workers have long been encouraged to feel they are as much a part of the company as the president.   As a result, during the past two decades of rapid growth, the Japanese auto industry has been untroubled by the long strikes that were regular events in Detroit into the 1970's. And Japanese auto workers have become known the world over for their attention to quality, low absentee rates and willingness to shift from one job to another as needed. The auto companies have responded with steadily rising wages and fringe benefits, including subsidized housing, and a no-layoff policy."

The current price among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is based on $34 for Saudi Light crude.  Total oil production by Saudi Arabia and its neighbors has declined to about 8.5 million barrels a day, from an average of 13.7 million in 1980, as they have tried to maintain their price structure despite the abundance of oil in world markets.

However, some strategic thinkers will question not only whether his plan is technically feasible but also whether it is militarily desirable.   Two assumptions have served as the foundation of the policies of deterrence that have guided the United States and the Soviet Union since the Russians acquired nuclear weapons in 1949. These assumptions are that there is not now any effective defense against nuclear attack, and that the present level of technology does not promise to provide such defense."

Some of his heirs may now be wishing that the p atriarch were still around to toss a little spare change their way.   No, the Rockefellers aren't running out of money. But their wealth is beginning to look just a little bit less awesome as more and more relatives line up to dip into the family kitty. In 1937, John D.  Rockefeller left his vast riches to a single son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., who in turn divided the fortune among his six children. Now the great pie is being sliced again -this time among 23 heirs, who themselves will have to provide for some 40 fifth-generation descendants.   With such demands on their inheritance, the Rockefellers are moving quietly, but purposefully, to generate more earnings from one of their principal sources of income - Rockefeller Center Inc.  R.C.I., which is owned by trusts benefiting the family members, is under pressure from the younger Rockefellers to invest in businesses that provide immediate dividend income and to sell off some of its more traditional real estate holdings, which offer only long-term gains."

''   Ellen Math decided he was right - ''I am the organized one,'' she says - and the couple joined the growing roster of ''mom-and-pop'' partnerships in high-technology businesses. Such companies have prospered as high technology has spread beyond its original breeding grounds near major universities, where pioneers divided their time between professorial duties and entrepreneurial dreams.   On Long Island alone, economists say, dozens of family-owned businesses have set up shop as assemblers, subcontractors and systems manufacturers. ''The problem in keeping up with them is that the falloff is extremely high,'' said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board.

But Don Pevsner, a Miami attorney who often handles consumers aviation cases, calls the label ''misleading.'' In fact, Mr. Pevsner has filed a petition with the Civil Aeronautics Board, which is now open for public comment, asking the board to outlaw the use of the term ''direct'' and replace it with ''through flight'' to indicate a flight that has at least one stop or a change of planes or both. The Northwest Orient flight is one of the examples Mr. Pevsner cited in his petition to the C.A.B."

''We're in a phase of recovery where a price decline would be very welcome.''

His has been a moderate voice in the nation, steering a path between the military regime and the more radical segments of the labor union movement.   He succeeded a greatly revered primate, the late Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, who was a symbol not only of the church but of Polish nationalism.

Mr. Nkomo's flight across the Botswana border on foot Tuesday night not only made a pathetic contrast to his triumphal return to what was then Rhodesia in January 1980, when a throng of 150,000 turned out to acclaim him at the start of his campaign for the election that was to dash his political dreams. It also appeared to mean that the longstanding division in the national movement is now beyond healing, in this generation at least.   In fact, the country had two national movements and two independence struggles from the time 20 years ago when Mr. Mugabe and others rejected Mr. Nkomo's leadership on the ground he was devious and prone to compromise. The split was papered over when the white minority regime was in its death throes and again after independence when Mr. Mugabe formed a coalition with Mr. Nkomo's party, even though his own Zimbabwe African National Union had won a clear majority in Parliament and a firm grip on power."

Official commentaries also depicted Mr. Reagan's speech as an effort by the Administration to push its arms buildup through the Congress.   The Soviet responses consisted of summaries of the President's televised address, referring to his ''beloved theme'' of a Soviet military threat and accusing him of using ''figures about the Soviet military potential fabricated by the Central Intelligence Agency to try and justify the unprecedented military expenditures.''   One commentary, by Tass, the official press agency, focused on Mr.  Reagan's proposed program ''to counter the awesome Soviet missile strength with measures that are defensive.''"

Food costs actually jumped six-tenths of 1 percent, the largest increase since last April. But this rise was balanced against declining energy costs.   Analysts said that food prices would continue to rise, putting pressure on the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which measures the cost of goods ready for sale at the retail level.Nevertheless, they said the index would rise this year less than last year's 3.5 percent increase, chiefly because of declining oil prices.

Ambassador Deane R. Hinton made his remarks after Jeane J.  Kirkpatrick, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, declined to comment on the subject at a news conference.   Mrs. Kirkpatrick's two-day visit to El Salvador has heightened speculation about whether the Reagan Administration will use an emergency discretionary fund to increase military aid above the $26.3 million Congress has already allocated for El Salvador in the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1."

In addition, the author made a material error in fact concerning the recent sale of an important Cities Service asset.   Those of us who have been close to the merger and to the leaders of both companies who made it happen clearly recognize the business risks involved. We are also, however, impressed with the imagination and extraordinary potential benefits which those risks, properly managed, can bring to this new ''major'' oil company which is now the twelfth-largest company in the United States."

Last week the bank won a $26 million jury award against the Dow Chemical Company, the maker of Sarabond, the mortar additive that caused the damage.   The 18-week Central National trial in Cleveland's Common Pleas Court was the first Sarabond case to get to a jury, but lawyers familiar with the problem say that Dow is facing dozens - and possibly hundreds - of similar claims. The Brick Institute of America estimates that Sarabond has been used in about 2,000 buildings."

At the same time the two officials -Thomas O. Enders, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs and Nestor D. Sanchez, Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for Inter-American Affairs - insisted that ''major national interests'' of the United States were at stake in El Salvador. Should the Salvadoran Government be defeated by the guerrillas, the officials said, the result would threaten other nations in Central America as well as Mexico and the Panama Canal.   ''We understand the concern of those who remember the specter of Vietnam that the war in El Salvador is being 'Americanized,' '' said Mr. Sanchez, who appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee's panel of Western Hemisphere Affairs. ''But Vietnam was 10,000 miles away. El Salvador is a contiguous region right at our doorstep. San Salvador is closer to Washington, D.C. than is San Francisco.''"

Sterling had for years been trying unsuccessfully to break Tylenol's grip on the pain reliever market, and this sudden moment of vulnerability must have seemed just the right time for Sterling to try again.   It was also an opportunity for the company to gain a foothold in the aspirin-free pain reliever market, something it has been refusing to attempt in recent years despite a decline in demand for aspirin products.   Accordingly, analysts say, Sterling decided to introduce its Panadol drug, a nonaspirin pain reliever sold only overseas for the past 25 years, into the United States next month. ''This marks a significant change in company strategy,'' said David Crossen, an analyst at Smith Barney."

But it is nearly a year since the first of the three broadbased stock index futures markets opened, and the handle still seems to elude and frustrate the professionals.   Much of the frustration stems from the fact that while the stock market has been on a strong upward trend since August, index futures longs, or buyers, have usually been whipsawed out of their paper profits by the many violent price swings that have attended the rise.    While the trading volume has soared, along with the stock market, since last August, the Value Line, Standard & Poor's 500 and New York Stock Exchange composite indexes remain ''coin-toss markets'' to most traders. About the only trend that is predictable is that these indexes rise and fall to varying degrees with the underlying averages."

In addition to having to cope with weak domestic demand, the industry is also losing market share to foreign producers."

Informal talks aimed at reaching such an agreement are under way, according to diplomats and Panamanian politicians.   Western diplomats familiar with the American position said the United States was willing to give Panama a larger voice in running the school if that was necessary to keep it open. Some nationalists in Panama, together with leftists from other Latin countries, demand that the school be removed because it symbolizes American support for militarism in the hemisphere."

The evidence, though not conclusive, includes information from a Bulgarian official who defected in France in July 1981.  The official, Iordan Mantarov, 48 years old, told French intelligence agents that the plot to kill the Pope was devised by the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency, and by the Bulgarian secret service, which many Western intelligence specialists consider subservient to Moscow.  The plan was drawn up, Mr. Mantarov said, because the two agencies believed that the Pope was the keystone of a United States effort to subvert the Polish Government and move it away from the Communist bloc.  The Bulgarian Government has called the implication that Bulgarians were involved in the assassination attempt on the Pope entirely without foundation and a fabrication put together by Western intelligence agencies. The Soviet Union has repeatedly denied any role in the attack."

In addition, the success of the program is seen by moderates here as a crucial element in the country's effort to succeed as a democracy and win the civil war against the leftist opposition.   While more than 80,000 peasants theoretically control land that was not theirs three years ago when the program began, they are struggling to hold onto their property through waves of evictions and vandalism. Moreover, the administrators of one of the two major agencies that manage a farm program are ''inefficient and incompetent,'' according to a high Government official."

Feldstein, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, was singing a new, more upbeat tune.  But in the Office of Management and Budget, the Treasury and some parts of the White House, it all sounded off-key.   Mr. Feldstein, with a new prediction that the economy could grow at a 5 percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, has become more optimistic than many forecasters.  And the switch, to the chagrin of some observers, has occurred in a matter of days."

These critics point to what they see as obscure and possibly misleading descriptions of the period of time for which advertised interest rates are available, the blending of two different rates into one on the checking accounts and maintenance fees that effectively reduce the actual interest paid."

Exxon and Socal are partners in the Arabian American Oil Company, or Aramco, which produces Saudi Arabia's oil and markets most of it.  The four American companies in the partnership - Exxon, Standard Oil, Texaco and Mobil - are committed to purchase Saudi oil at $34, although the price of Saudi Light oil on the spot, or noncontract market has fallen to as low as $28 a barrel.

Auto production surged 13 percent, but business equipment output fell 19.5 percent. For the year, production fell 8.2 percent, the biggest annual decline since 1974.   American businesses reduced the value of their inventories by 1.1 percent in November, the largest monthly drop recorded. Inventories fell $5.6 billion to a seasonally adjusted $508.6 billion. Spending for expansion and modernization will be reduced by 5.2 percent in 1983, American business executives said."

Delegates at a weeklong meeting of the 97-nation movement of countries that profess nonalignment, which was expected to end late tonight or early Saturday, specifically denounced ''systematic attacks'' against Nicaragua that ''form a part of a deliberate plan to harass and destabilize Nicaragua, as admitted publicly by a foreign power.''   After lengthy closed-door negotiations, however, several key paragraphs in the meeting's final declaration were couched in less strongly anti-American language than in the draft originally proposed by Nicaragua and Cuba, which is the current head of the movement."

Well, if the law firm is Kirkland & Ellis, the answer is that many of the Washington lawyers split off to create their own firm. The split, effective next week, arose from the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, when Elmer W. Johnson, the managing partner of Kirkland & Ellis, was asked to be special counsel to the Middle Western holding company that is taking over the operation of five of A.T.& T.'s Middle Western subsidiaries.   Mr. Johnson's decision to take the job did not sit well with Richard E. Wiley, the former Federal Communications Commission chairman who was hired by Mr. Johnson in 1977 to head Kirkland & Ellis's Washington office. Mr. Wiley, who has a large communications practice, knew that Mr. Johnson's new client would make it impossible for him to keep his clients, and said as much to the partnership, but the Chicago office chose to take on the holding company anyway."

The toughest challenge derives from the persistent huge budget deficits that threaten to impair the future health of the economy for years to come. According to the official estimates, the budget deficit would rise from $231 billion in fiscal year 1984 to $300 billion in fiscal year 1988, if the Administration's request for rapidly escalating defense spending were fully implemented without further tax increases or offsetting cuts in domestic programs."

The letter, which reiterated Mr. Vogel's call for compromise, was described by Social Democrats as a reaction to Mr. Reagan's statement Wednesday that the United States would receive a ''terrible setback'' if West Germans elected a government opposed to the deployment of 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Western Europe under a decision of the Atlantic alliance. These missiles are intended to offset 600 medium-range missiles already deployed by the Soviet Union."

It has a balmy climate, miles of unspoiled sand beaches, ample farmland, an array of untapped minerals, and potentially rich oil reserves offshore in the turquoise waters of the South China Sea.   China is now dangling the island's varied potential as one of its latest attractions for foreign investment under its open-door economic policy. Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang recently underscored the interest in developing Hainan when he stopped over for several days on the way home from his tour of Africa.   Officials remain vague about specific plans for the island.  ''Several policies are being considered to let Hainan enjoy more flexible measures than Guangdong Province,'' said Zeng Dingshi, the deputy governor of Guangdong, which administers Hainan. ''Later on, these series of policies can be made public.''"

Economists at major financial institutions have been predicting that the number of unemployed blacks could soar by 250,000 or more in the coming months as a result of a simultaneous slump in the country's foreign and domestic markets.   The level of black joblessness in the country has been a matter of prolonged dispute between the keepers of the Government's statistics and academic experts. The official estimate of black unemployment now stands at about 500,000, but Government statistics no longer take account of blacks in four tiny black states, or so-called homelands, that are deemed by South Africa - but by no other government - to have gained their independence."

The original cease-fire proposal involved only the forces directly involved in the South-West Africa conflict. That is, South Africa itself and the insurgent South-West Africa People's Organization, which wants the South African-administered territory to become the independent nation of Namibia.   The new proposal fits the Reagan Administration's efforts to use the Namibian plan as a lever for a broader regional settlement, in that it provides for the mutual withdrawal from southern Angola of foreign forces - both South Africans and Cubans - as well as those of the Luanda-based Angolan regime."

Now, the French Government of President Francois Mitterrand is fighting another Battle of Poitiers, but this time the objective is to save the French video recorder market from being overrun by Japanese imports.   Since last November, all foreign-made video recorders entering France must be cleared through a nine-man customs depot in this pleasant town in western France -which, not coincidentally, is hundreds of miles from the northern ports where the units are landed. Once the recorders make their way to the depot here, they are subjected to intensive, time-consuming checks. And by coincidence, 732 is the code number the French Customs use to identify goods coming from Janpan."

There is growing interest in France, and to a lesser degree in Britain, for greater speed in developing European defense options that would complement NATO's systems, strengthen allied commitments to defend West Germany and offer it greater possibilities to increase its sense of control over its own affairs.   For several West European analysts, an important lesson emerging from the West German election campaign and its talk of neutralism, pacifism and drift is that Chancellor Helmut Kohl is not finished struggling with those trends. As much as Mr. Kohl's election removed intense concern about destablization in West Germany, some officials, notably at the French Foreign Ministry, regarded the entry of the Greens into the Parliament and the apparent leftward movement of the Social Democratic Party as relative gains in insitutional strength and respectability for anti-Atlantic Alliance attitudes."

Yes, the Consumer Price Index figures were high, they said, but the price index overstates the inflation rate because sharp upward swings in mortgage interest rates and house prices distort it.   Now, with inflation quiescent for the first time in years and with most of the damage from the distortions already done, the Government has finally fixed the index.   Today, with the release of the January price index, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has switched to a new method of calculating housing costs.

Ogarkov, chief of the Soviet General Staff, suggested today that if the American medium-range missiles planned for deployment in Europe were used against the Soviet Union, the Russians would retaliate directly against the United States. For the most part, the marshal, in a rare interview with a Western correspondent, struck a moderate posture, in particular by modifying his previous position and saying that once nuclear war began it could not be limited and controlled. He said: ''The idea of nuclear war has never been tested. But by logic, to keep such a war limited will not be possible.''   ''Inevitably,'' he added, ''such a war will extend to all-out war.'' Statements by Civilian Leaders   This new statement brings Marshal Ogarkov, who is also a First Deputy Minister of Defense, into line with virtually identical statements by top Soviet civilian leaders. It was apparently intended to curtail speculation about civilian-military rifts over nuclear doctrine and to undercut Western assertions that Soviet policy called for fighting prolonged nuclear wars, as United States policy does."

Bankers and dealers generally expect the officials to agree on a realignment of the fixed exchange rates that eight of the 10 Common Market countries maintain among their currencies under the rules of the European Monetary System.   The realignment is expected to involve an upward revaluation of the mark by about 4 percent or 5 percent and a devaluation of the French franc by roughly the same amount, with some adjustments in the other currencies possible as well.   It would be the third devaluation of the franc since the Socialists came to power nearly two years ago and tried to break out of the world recession by a sharp increase in Government spending. The result was higher inflation and a widening of France's external trade deficit."

Not entirely unexpectedly, Senator Pete V. Domenici, a long-time supporter of the idea, is expected to introduce a bill this week to levy a $10-a-barrel tax on imported petroleum and refined products.  The only exemption, according to the New Mexico Republican's staff, would be for crude oil that is imported and then refined for immediate export.   The tax program would permit the President, subject only to a twohouse veto, to adjust the tax rate up or down in $2.50 increments.  There is only one problem. So far President Reagan has been inhospitable to the idea of taxing imported oil, preferring instead to see cheaper oil help the fledgling economic recovery, which with luck and a further decline in oil prices, could be in full swing in the 1984 election year."

The effort was undertaken at considerable political risk by the head of the regional Basque government, Carlos Garaikoetxea. It centered on prospective three-way talks involving his own Basque Nationalist Party, local representatives of the Socialist Party, and the political wing of E.T.A, the Basque separatist organization.   The talks, which were still in a formative stage, collapsed after guerrillas belonging to E.T.A.'s hard-line ''military'' faction killed a civil guardsman and wounded two seriously in an attack on their vehicle in the town of Ordizia on Feb. 2.

Andropov.   Compared with past conversations with many of the same officials and academic experts, even after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in late 1979, there seemed to be outright hostility toward the United States. The feelings of the officials seemed to match the hostility President Reagan expressed in his ''focus of evil'' speech of March 8.   There also seemed to be more than the usual reluctance to acknowledge any Soviet faults, less hope about and even less interest in improving relations with the United States, and greater felt but unspoken uncertainty about their own future.   These are the impressions gathered in conversations from March 7 to 17 with military, civilian, party and academic officials in Moscow and Kiev, in restaurants, in walks along gray boulevards and in the conference rooms of foreign policy institutes where outsiders are usually received."

The miscalculation cost the carrier much business during the height of the summer tourist season, when it generally makes most of its money, and has left it in a more difficult position during the current slow period. Pan Am's experience also illustrates the power of the travel agent over the airline industry.   Last March, Pan Am suspended commission overrides - the added payments that some travel agencies receive if they surpass certain sales levels. It also withdrew such bonuses as free travel for those who arrange convention business."

The budget, disclosed by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the traditonal, minutely detailed speech to the House of Commons, contained tax cuts for individuals and industry. But they amounted to only $2.2 billion - considerably less than some people had predicted - and the tenor of the $182 billion budget lacked the vote-getting appeal that British Governments usually try to incorporate into pre-election budgets.   Eric Heffer, a leading Labor Member of Parliament, spoke for many in the opposition and some Tory back-benchers when he predicted a more political budget a year from now before Mrs. Thatcher goes to the country. ''There were a few goodies given away here and there,'' he commented, but he described the budget as a whole as restrained."

The new approach consists of substantial economic aid mixed with military assistance, support for democratic social change and a deliberate retreat from the Administration's early statements portraying the poor and weak countries of Central America as dominoes of the East-West conflict. Administration officials say the approach amounts, in some ways, to a bipartisan continuation of Carter Administration policies.   But there are conflicting assessments both within and outside the Administration of how much the policy itself has really changed. Assertions of Progress   State Department officials say that events in the region have taken a positive turn and that left-wing movements there have lost their momentum. In contrast to two years ago, Administration officials assert, guerrillas in El Salvador and Guatemala no longer threaten to topple the Governments there. Nicaragua's leftist Government, which has sought to blunt the powers of the Roman Catholic Church and the press, has lost considerable support at home and abroad. Costa Rica, Panama and Honduras are openly supporting American policy."

Winpisinger accused the current Department of Labor of ''Abandoning Its Original Mandate'' (Dec.5), he opened the way for Labor Department Secretary Raymond J. Donovan and Thorne G.  Auchter, in charge of the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, to make sanctimonious claims that it is they who are serving all workers by their reliance on the cooperation of employers motivated equally by humanitarian and monetary considerations.   The president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ignores the fact that most other union officials have also forgotten their ''original mandate'' and are concentrating on the preservation enhancement of the ''goodies'' acquired in its halcyon days of Labor with a capital ''L'' while he, Mr. Winpisinger, pursues his lonely course.   In this time of national and world crisis, they are more concerned with illusory protective tariffs, special safeguards for members of privileged unions, and retention of the ''fringes'' which they obtained from hitherto affluent corporations and government bureaus with fat budgets, paid for by the 80 percent nonunion, wage-earning consumers with higher taxes and inflated prices."

With perhaps tens of million of dollars at stake, the Civil Aeronautics Board has expedited hearings on the matter.   The issue concerns the possibility that under recently revised guidelines, American Airlines and United Airlines, which own the reservation and ticketing computers used by most travel agents, may routinely be designated as the ''ticketing'' carriers -even when they will not actually transport the passengers involved.   Since fares will promptly be paid to the computer owner, that carrier may be able to make profitable use of the funds long before the actual trip is made and money flows back to the airline, or airlines, that do the flying."

Andropov said today that President Reagan's new proposal for an American defense system against missiles was ''a bid to disarm the Soviet Union'' that would launch the two nations into ''a runaway race'' in strategic nuclear weapons and defense systems against them.   The Soviet leader said the United States and the Soviet Union had agreed a decade ago that no progress in limiting offensive nuclear weapons could be made unless there was ''mutual restraint'' in the field of missile defenses.   Mr. Andropov said that Mr. Reagan, by announcing Wednesday that he favored a research program to find a defense system that could destroy missiles aimed at the United States, had shown that the United States intended ''to sever this interrelationship.'' 'This Would Open the Floodgates'   The Soviet leader added: ''Should this conception be converted into reality, this would actually open the floodgates to a runaway race of all types of strategic arms, both offensive and defensive. Such is the real purport, the seamy side, so to say, of Washington's 'defensive conception.' ''"

In the past, he says, he has treated them for all kinds of esoteric woes but, of late, they have been arriving in numbers seeking the banal: ointment for burns, stitches for cuts, balm for sundry indignities. The reason, the doctor says, is that previously the women all depended on their stewards from Ghana and Benin and elsewhere to do the household chores. The servants, largely, are gone now, victims of Nigeria's decision to expel illegal immigrants, and so the women must cope with forgotten challenges: overheating stoves and undisciplined carving knives. There has even been a run on washing machines in the local market now that human launderers have departed."

The White House is anxious to avoid any action or statements that would appear to involve the United States in Israeli politics, Administration officials said. Specifically, they said, the Administration wants to avoid any impression that it is supporting Mr. Navon against Mr. Begin, with whom the Reagan Administration has clashed on Middle East policy."

An Israeli spokesman said the agenda included ''the termination of the state of war,'' ''a framework for mutual relations,'' security arrangements and the withdrawal of Israeli troops ''within the context of the evacuation of all foreign forces.''   The announcement was made while Israeli, Lebanese and American negotiators were meeting in the northern Israeli border town of Qiryat Shemona. Formulation Was the Issue   The sticking point had been the issue of mutual relations. Israel originally wanted the term ''normalization'' to appear at the head of the list of items to be discussed, but Lebanon objected, fearing that such an explicit step toward diplomatic recognition of Israel would further complicate Moslem-Christian relations in Lebanon and strain ties with other Arab nations."

A statement issued by the Defense Department said the satellite, known as Cosmos 1402, was similar to an earlier Cosmos satellite that crashed in an uninhabited area of northern Canada in January 1978, causing minor radiation contamination. Administration officials said the Cosmos 1402 was believed to contain about 100 pounds of enriched uranium for a reactor that provides electricity for its radar, which observes American naval operations. Danger From Radioactivity   Officials emphasized that the danger of the satellite was not from the possibility of an explosion but from the radioactivity of its nuclear-fission products. Strontium 90, for example, builds up in the reactor as its uranium fuel is consumed."

The first impulse toward a review of strategy, some high-ranking Israeli and Arab intelligence sources said, came last summer after the Israeli Air Force destroyed Soviet-made radar and surface-to-air missile systems in eastern Lebanese areas held by Syrian troops.   This destruction was said to have brought Col. Gen. Yevgeny S.  Yurasov, a first deputy commander of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, to Damascus on June 13. The general and his aides reportedly inspected the ruined SAM sites in the Bekaa in eastern Lebanon and promised extensive new supplies of both weapons systems and radar."

Weinberger has rejected a proposed agreement with Israel under which Israeli forces would have shared military information they gained during the Lebanon conflict, Administration officials said today.   The officials said Mr. Weinberger decided against the agreement because he felt it would have trapped the United States into longrange commitments to Israel that he wanted to avoid. They said Mr. Weinberger distrusted present Israeli leaders, who demanded too much.   The Administration officials said Mr. Weinberger had decided, as one put it, ''The information was not worth the price being asked.'' They tried to play down the value of the intelligence, tactical and technical information and said much had already been learned through normal military contacts."

Because many of these traders now have large paper profits, the slightest rally in the dollar tends to provoke profit taking."

Shultz, seeking to defuse opposition to increased military aid for El Salvador, told a Senate subcommittee today that Salvadoran leaders had been warned to ''clean up'' their human rights record or lose all American support.   Testifying on behalf of the Administration's request to transfer $60 million more for emergency military aid to El Salvador, Mr.  Shultz avoided confrontations with critics on the committee. He did so by agreeing with most of their complaints about human rights abuses in El Salvador, particularly the delay in bringing to trial five former National Guardsmen accused of killing four American churchwomen in December 1980. 'Support Is Going to Dry Up'   ''You cannot get me to sit here and defend what has happened under the judicial system of El Salvador,'' Mr. Shultz told Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennslvania. ''I won't do it. I don't do it.  I don't think it is defensible. If they don't clean up this act, the support is going to dry up, and they've been told that and they know that and that will happen.''"

The reservoir, which is half the size of a football field, was visited on an inspection trip recently by an Israeli engineer carrying blueprints for a United Nations project. The project envisages draining the noxious pool, replacing Rafah's sewage gutters with 24 miles of underground asbestos pipe and building a modern plant whose treated water would irrigate the surrounding groves of oranges, lemons and grapefruit.   The venture is one of 1,200 projects run by the United Nations Development Program in an effort to raise living standards in the third world. But in this Israeli-occupied area it also represents a little-noticed example of indirect collaboration, through the development program, between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization."

Under the 1981 tax act, last year was the first time that all workers - even those covered by employee pension plans - could get a tax break for setting up a retirement nest egg. Not only does an I.R.A. lower current taxes by permitting a deduction for the amount of your yearly contribution, but the income that your I.R.A. account earns gathers tax-free until you start to withdraw it at retirement.   The law gives everyone until the due date for filing their tax returns (April 15), plus any extensions, to make I.R.A. contributions for the previous tax year. The contribution limit for 1982 is 100 percent of earned income, up to a maximum contribution of $2,000.

Second, what is the optimal allocation of real resources among the military, transfer programs such as Social Security and public sector investment in roads, transit, schools and hospitals?

As always, those with power will win. But economics can help by putting the argument in context, and by pointing out the implications of one course or another."

Andropov, the Soviet leader, have sometimes dangled the prospect of a summit meeting to sway public opinion, but so far neither side is visibly engaged in serious preparations for such a meeting.   In his open letter Monday calling for a meeting, President Reagan proposed that Mr. Andropov accept terms that Moscow had previously rejected - the original Reagan offer to ban all intermediate-range missiles, including the 572 that NATO is scheduled to deploy in Europe and the 600 missiles that Moscow already has lined up against Western Europe and Asia.   Thus it came as no surprise here that Mr. Andropov rejected the proposal as ''a political or a propaganda game'' offering nothing new and treating a meeting between the two leaders lightly. His speedy rebuff was seen as a shrewd effort to prevent Mr. Reagan from throwing Moscow on the defensive."

In last week's standing-room-only appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker (right) took the oath again to encourage both recovery and lower inflation. Precisely how remains the question. But the chairman gave Fed watchers a new clue to future central bank behavior. They should keep one eye on the M's and the other eye on a new statistic: total borrowings by nonfinancial businesses, households and governments.  The market's response to Mr. Volcker's recital: rates up, down, flat.   Flexing its muscles. That's how President Reagan characterized the economy during a news conference. Just weeks ago, the President only saw economic seeds beginning to sprout. Whatever the case, analysts are coming around to the idea that G.N.P. growth, fourth quarter 1982 to fourth quarter 1983, will reach 4 percent. And news from the Government - that housing starts were up 35.9 percent and factory output gained nine-tenths of 1 percent in January -seems to support the upbeat view."

It has happened before. Although predictions for an anemic recovery still predominate, some economists foresee a somewhat snappier comeback.   ''I think people are going to be surprised about the strength of the recovery as we move through the year,'' said Edward Guay, chief economist for the Cigna Corporation, the insurance company. He predicted that real gross national product in the fourth quarter of 1983 will be 5.8 percent higher than in the last quarter of 1982, and that industrial production will be 8 percent higher. He said that average annual real G.N.P. in 1983 will be 3.6 percent above 1982.   ''Forecasters, by and large, have usually underestimated the speed of recovery once it gets started,'' stated Edgar R. Fiedler, vice president for economic research at the Conference Board. ''It is often hard to see the sources of strength. But once they get started, they tend to cumulate even faster than expected.''"

The brief protest, quickly broken up by the riot police, reflected the resentment deeply held by many in Poland over the imposition of martial law in December 1981 and the crushing of the independent union Solidarity.   It was the largest demonstration since since early last fall and came after a declaration by the former Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa, that ''harder tactics'' must be used and after a bitter letter of protest to Parliament by the shipyard workers.   The rally was called for 1 o'clock this afternoon in leaflets furtively handed out in the last few days in the streets and near Roman Catholic churches. The 13th of each month - the date on which martial law was declared - has become a traditional day of protest. A similar call for another rally has gone out for Monday, timed to coincide with the midafternoon shift change at the shipyard."

The Pope is expected to issue the new code on Tuesday, the 24th anniversary of the announcement by Pope John XXIII ordering the revision.   The church specialists say the draft of the revised code, reflecting the sweeping changes set forth by the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65, emphasizes meeting people's needs more than issuing strictures. For example, it reduces the offenses punishable by excommunication from 37 to 6.   Canon law defines church procedure based on official teachings, as set forth by Popes and supreme councils such as Vatican II. The code is seen as a measure of how liberally or conservatively those teachings will be interpreted. And though it sets standards, most Catholic officials agree that church government in modern times is effected by consent rather than compulsion."

It does not imply that the person is a world-class programmer. It is a skill like driving an automobile and being able to know how to get to Cape Cod, for example. That is very different from knowing how to take a car's transmission apart. Kids as well as adults can be taught computer literacy.''"

As a result, a commercial bank can now engage in retail brokerage services.   The Schwab ruling parallels the Fed's monetarist solution to inflation through a tight money policy. Prolonged high interest rates are arguably a direct cause of the current recession and the Schwab ruling seems counter to express statutory and Supreme Court language. More disturbing, both were made by appointed officials through procedures contrary to the legislative process."

Since Mr. Manchester's index multiplies the number of unemployed by the average duration of unemployment, though, it is sensitive to the absolute size of the labor force, which grows over time."

Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the Paradyne Corporation of using fraudulent tactics to win a $100 million computer contract from the Social Security Administration.  Because Paradyne's own computers were not ready at the time of its scheduled presentation, the S.E.C. charged, the company showed the Social Security Administration another company's computer with Paradyne's name on it. The company also demonstrated a data encoder that was merely an ''empty box with blinking lights,'' the S.E.C.  said."

The commission will vote whether to offer for public comment a proposal that would allow the money funds to advertise the effective yields on their assets on a compounded basis. This figure would be comparable to the compounded interest rates now featured in many ads for banks' money market accounts and ''Super NOW'' accounts.   At present, banks are permitted to advertise the return on their accounts on a compounded basis, but money market funds are not. This means, for instance, that over a short period each might return investors an annualized yield of, say, 12 percent, but the banks can boast - often with big numbers in bold type - that their money market accounts yield a compounded annual rate of 12.68 percent."

Andropov today offered the Soviet leader's toughest indictment yet of the country's economic failings and outlined a fresh approach that would combine political flexibility, material incentives and a crackdown on those who, in his words, ''sponge on society.''   The article appeared intended to place as much distance as possible between him and the policies he inherited from Leonid I.  Brezhnev, but it stopped short of specific programs. Mr. Andropov confined himself to generalities, suggesting that he wanted first to hammer home the seriousness of the problems before espousing remedies that could be politically contentious.   The article, running to 8,000 words, was prepared for publication in Kommunist, an authoritative party journal that appears 18 times a year and has a circulation of a million.

Mr. Bush went from The Hague to Brussels on his tour of capitals of North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to convince Western European public opinion that the Reagan Administration is intent on seeking arms reductions. The Vice President emphasized that the allied willingness to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons was the strongest possible moral position the NATO countries could take.   At the same time, he said, it is up to the Russians to respond.  This approach - stressing morality and calling for Soviet movement - appeared to be the developing theme of the 12-day tour of six alliance countries."

It was his poem, distributed during the closing hours of the cartel's cantankerous London meeting, that seemed to cause more hard feelings among his colleagues than the discord over prices.   But while his rhymed lament about OPEC's langourous negotiating habits - to say nothing of the obstinacy of his Nigerian colleagues - has become his best-known work, it is arguably not his most important piece of writing.   That distinction belongs to one short passage in his published Ph.D. thesis, which marked him as one of the first Arabs to say publicly that it was the Nixon Administration that encouraged the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to quadruple world oil prices in 1973 by suggesting that the West had few, if any, alternatives to Arab oil.   The dissertation soon became a key document in the once fierce controversy that raged in Washington some years ago over whether the United States itself was responsible for the first oil price explosion and the decade of recession that followed it."

The Egyptian leader has said repeatedly that if the United States does not speedily obtain the removal of Israeli soldiers from Lebanon, American relations with the Arab world will be gravely affected.   Simultaneously, he has been urging Arab leaders, most of whom have no formal diplomatic ties with Egypt, to act quickly on President Reagan's plan for finding a solution to the Palestinian problem.   The relationship with the United States, Egypt's largest provider of economic and military aid, is still strong, Egyptian officials say. But it is not the close-knit, even cozy, alliance favored by Mr. Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat, who was assassinated on Oct. 6, 1981."

Strong, the peripatetic Canadian businessman and statesman, recognized that developing countries could least afford the increases and would suffer the most.   The recognition inspired Mr. Strong - an energy expert who is well known in most of the world's capitals - to put together an omnibus energy management group to help cash-poor but resource-rich countries to produce fuel inside their own borders.   The Geneva-based and largely Kuwaiti-financed organization, the International Energy Development Corporation, is active now in the Sudan, Australia, Tanzania and Pakistan, among other countries. Last week, Mr. Strong took another step to buttress its development capacity when he was named vice chairman of the Tosco Corporation."

''The number of scientists and engineers engaged in research and development in the United States increased by only 25 percent between 1964 and 1979,'' he said to an audience that included 500 of Florida's top math and science students. ''The increase in France was 90 percent; a 125 percent increase in Germany and 145 percent in Japan,'' he continued. Moreover, he added, Japan, with roughly half the population of the United States, is producing more engineers.   The Soviet Union, Mr. Reagan said, which introduces basic concepts in geometry and algebra in its elementary schools, turns out five times as many engineering specialists each year as the United States. ''Obviously,'' he concluded, ''we must do better or we will be overtaken. In math and science instruction, the United States is a slow learner among the major industrial nations.''"

Mr. Botha's account of the negotiations came as a South African envoy, Adriaan Eksteen, was meeting in the Cape Verde Islands with Angolan officials to arrange a second round of ministerial talks.  Discussions were held there last month. The first round, the Foreign Minister said, skirted both South Africa's demand for the withdrawal of the estimated 25,000 Cuban troops as a condition for a settlement in South-West Africa and Angola's charges that South Africa supports the Angolan insurgency led by Jonas Savimbi."

These are not the kind of people that visiting delegations from the United States tend to meet. Indeed, a better understanding of the social background of the country's three-year-old civil war can be gotten by spending a day in a refugee camp and the evening in one of the fortressed homes of the upper class.   But the men and women of Miramonte had plenty to say to a visitor about the war and their Government. Many believe that unless opportunities are given to El Salvador's poor, the leftist opposition will be strenthened and their own ambitions threatened."

Despite the many displays of hissing and twisting industrial robots and flickering display screens on microprocessor-controlled machinery in the fair's 16 sprawling pavilions, Western experts said the capacity of the equipment limped far behind that of the West. There were clear indications, they said, that East bloc companies were stepping up efforts to acquire partners in the West."

If they had not l ent large sums to less developed countries, the oil shocks of 1 974-75 and 1979-80 would have done far more damage to the whole w orld economy.   Now, in the 1980's, the banks are part of the problem, because they have lent so much to less-developed countries. If economic recovery is slow or weak in the industrial countries, the less developed countries will be unable to service their debts - to pay interest and refinance principal. Worse yet, they will continue to face large balance-of-payments deficits and will be unable to cover them by new borrowings. Moreover, their debt problems may even weaken global recovery.   At the end of 1982, the external debts of these countries (excluding debts of East European countries and of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) exceeded $550 billion. Their debts to banks exceeded $350 billion, including about $130 billion owed to American banks. The total debt is sharply concentrated. Mexico, Brazil and Argentina top a short list of large debtors that also includes such OPEC countries as Venezuela, Indonesia and Nigeria. In the 1970's, you could have counted on the fingers of one hand the countries that had fallen behind in their debt-service payments. Now, you would run out of fingers and toes."

Japanese, Dutch and West G erman stocks have moved up and may be at the start of a prolonged b ull market. Even Australia and Spain, after being shunned by foreigni nvestors, are favorites of some top money men.   The reason, according to mutual fund managers who specialize in overseas stock markets, is that if the American economy continues to recover, other economies will follow and their markets will move up sharply.   It's not that these funds have done particularly well lately. They were left in the dust last year by funds that invest at home and that reaped the huge gains of the 1982 bull market. And they still are lagging. From the first of the year through late last week, the 13 international mutual funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services were ahead 6.19 percent, compared with an 8.99 percent gain for the 358 equity funds that invest in the United States."

In a joint venture announced last month with Federated Department Stores Inc., JMB will use its own money to develop five shopping malls.   Until now, the 14-year-old firm has readily invested its own capital in office-building properties. But when it came to shoppingcenter properties, JMB limited itself to less risky deals that involved putting capital raised through limited partnerships into existing, occupied centers."

In advance of those auctions, which have been prominent in the minds of speculators and traders for several weeks, dealers in Government securities have already begun distributing and trading the securities. This pre-auction activity has the approval of the Treasury, since it gives dealers more time to find buyers - most of whom are speculators or large instititions - and thereby helps lower the interest rate, set at the auctions, that the Treasury has to pay.    Although individual investors rarely make commitments before the auction, they watch the early activity for indications of what interest rates the auctions will produce."

GANDHI LOSES GRIP ON 2 STATES,"  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi suffered a major political defeat today when her Congress Party lost control of two southern states it had dominated since India became independent in 1947.   Opposition parties swept to stunning victories in legislative elections held on Wednesday in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the only states in India where the Congress Party had not previously been defeated.   An election was also held in the northeastern state of Tripura, where Gandhi nominees failed in their effort to oust a coalition of leftist parties.   While the outcome in the three state elections was a jolt to Mrs.  Gandhi's prestige, her party still controls 15 of India's 22 states, and it has a two-thirds majority in the national Parliament. But the setbacks led to some speculation that she might decide to call a general election before it is due in January 1985."

Not only will the car, to be assembled at a G.M. plant in Fremont, Calif., be a Toyota design, but it will have a Toyota engine and transmission and the entire 50-50 operation will be under the supervision of a Toyota executive.   G.M.'s need for help from a company that its executives hardly deigned to notice not many years ago raises the question of why the world's largest manufacturing corporation, once studied as the model of scientific management, cannot produce a high-quality small car on its own.   ''The answer is, they can, but they would have to price it at $10,000,'' said Martin L. Anderson, director of the Future of the Automobile program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The key advantage enjoyed by Japanese manufacturers is an efficiency of production that permits Toyota, for example, to sell its subcompact Tercel in the United States for about $5,000."

The rest of the year, he works on lobbying the less promising delegates from Europe, Asia and Latin America.   His cause, independence from Indonesia for the half million people of East Timor, loses ground every year at the United Nations.  ''It is very, very depressing,'' the slight, soft-spoken Mr. Horta said in a recent conversation. ''The hypocrisy of certain countries contributes to this fallback in support. An act of typical colonial aggression is carried out by a third world country, but most of the members of the third world bloc prefer to shut their eyes. There is a live-and-let-live principle among third world nations.''"

Tonnage and revenues are down because of the recession. Scores of truckers, caught in rate wars following deregulation of the industry, have gone bankrupt. Washington has just imposed a new series of tax increases on truck fuel, truck parts, truck use and truck sales.   And once again, as they did twice in the last decade, the nation's 100,000 independent truckers - who haul 90 percent of the nation's fresh food and half of its steel - are threatening to strike. This time their aim is to persuade Congress to provide some relief from the new taxes. The stoppage is scheduled next Monday.   No one knows how many of the independents - drivers who own their own tractors but generally haul trailers provided by someone else - will heed the strike call or how many other drivers will honor the stoppage if it comes.

Today, the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Group has two formidable competitors - Rolls-Royce and the General Electric Aircraft Group, which also has a joint venture with a French company - and each of the more efficient planes, the Boeing 757 and 767 and the Airbus A300 series, can be fitted with engines from at least two of the manufacturers.   ''Things are quite different today,'' said Robert J. Carlson, executive vice president of the power sector of the United Technologies Corporation, the parent company of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Group. ''The risk is so much greater and the cost of development is so much greater,'' he said in an interview in his office in Hartford."

These 1,700 employees at Atari assembled home computers and video games."

The proceeds from the sale - the third-largest industrial stock offering ever - plus some 10 million new Chrysler common shares are expected to be given to Chrysler's creditors in mid-May in exchange for $1.1 billion in face value of preferred shares and 10.6 million warrants."

Although some Wall Street analysts have been expecting record tax refunds this year - one predicts they will total $65 billion, up from $55 billion last year - they say they seem to be running sharply behind the 1982 level.   This implies that the Treasury will be scaling down the amounts it must raise in the capital market in coming weeks. The question now, the analysts say, is whether there will be a later burst of refunds that will confirm their prediction, or whether they will prove to have overestimated."

These functions could not be performed by Americans or Europeans, he said in remarks, in English, to a group of American Jewish spokesmen.   As described by Mr. Sharon, the stations would apparently involve a significant Israeli presence in Lebanon even after the main Israeli Army units are withdrawn. He did not disclose the exact number of personnel, but said it would be under 750. Other officials have said that the Israelis at the three outposts would coordinate with local, Christian-led militia in policing the southern part of the country, up to about 30 miles north of the Israeli border."

West and Prof. Dennis E. Logue of Dartmouth questioned our ideas about managers' role in our nation's faltering industrial competitiveness (''The False Doctrines of Productivity,'' Jan.9, and ''A Plea to Reject Economic Fashion,'' Jan.16). While we welcome debate on these issues, we believe that their comments are misleading in a number of important respects.   Their case rests on three main arguments: American managers cannot be criticized for short-term thinking because investment in plant and equipment has actually been increasing over the period we consider; the degree of management responsibility for our current industrial problems can be appraised through the analysis of a few financial indices, and such financial tools as discounted cash flow analysis cannot be blamed for our faltering competitiveness because they are in no way biased against long-term investment.   Mr. West and Mr. Logue begin by pointing out that the rate of growth in manufacturing investment was greater between 1972 and 1980 than in earlier years. They argue that this is evidence of United States management's long-term orientation, and chide others to ''look at the facts.'' Let's do that."

On the last day of a three-day conference, Prof. Karl W. Deutsch of Harvard University cautioned that the ''experience of 1929-1933 showed that there are traditional, accepted forms of economic policy that are meant to stabilize the economy, while destabilizing society itself.''   ''It was a problem then, it is a problem now,'' he said.  The often highly charged discussions, which took place in the reconstructed Central Hall of the Reichstag, a stone's throw from the wall that divides East and West Berlin, ended this afternoon with an emotional debate in which some historians aggressively defended postwar West Germany against the charge that it failed to come to grips with its Nazi past by repressing the memory of Nazi atrocities."

Industry officials maintain that the increases only reflect the sweeping changes that have taken place in their business.  For more than a year, refining companies have been lowering their prices for oil products faster than crude oil prices have fallen, and this has reduced their profit margins. This trend has developed as the refiners sought to maintain their shares of the market as overall demand declined and surplus refining capacity expanded."

The statement appeared to be intended to reassure the Soviet-backed Government of Afghanistan and to curb speculation in the West that the new Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov, might be preparing to accept a face-saving settlement to extract more than 100,000 Soviet troops from a seemingly intractable war.   The statement, while not quite as authoritative as an official Government pronouncement, is regarded as a clear indication of Moscow's views. It reaffirmed the terms set out by the Afghan Government in May 1980 and August 1981, which have formed the Soviet position on the war. These are that Soviet troops will be withdrawn once ''foreign armed intervention,'' meaning Moslem guerrillas fighting with Western backing, is ended. In addition, the Afghan leaders have demanded ''dependable international guarantees'' against a resumption of the fighting."

The December rise was markedly below the increase of six-tenths of 1 percent in November and was the smallest one-month change since prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent in September.   Assessing the year's greatly improved inflation picture, economists pointed to the worldwide oil surplus, which has held down gasoline and heating oil prices; abundant harvests, and the lingering recession, which has driven the unemployment rate to 10.8 percent, the highest since 1940.

The warning came amid reports received by the department that Rumania had begun carrying out the law. The measure, announced Nov.  1, would require those wishing to emigrate to repay the Rumanian Government for all state-provided education beyond the compulsory 10 years.   Officials in Washington said the tax, which they thought would prevent most citizens from emigrating, ranged from a few thousand dollars for the equivalent of a high school education to $40,000 for a graduate degree.

A ''bionic man'' is not yet on the drawing board.   But there is no doubt that replacement parts for the human body are becoming big business, for their makers as well as for distributors.  Artificial legs, joints, arms, kidneys and larynxes, along with pacemakers, heart valves, intraocular lenses and other medical developments have passed through the test stage into commercial distribution.   A survey of the industries that produce implantable medical devices, conducted by Creative Strategies International, of San Jose, Calif., found that total revenues for seven of the top-selling implantable items topped $1.5 billion in 1982, and projected a compound annual growth rate for the next five years of 22.9 percent."

Weir, the company's founder and a self made industrialist, so fiercely fought unions and the labor policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.   Today, the town is talked about for a new reason: Workers, townspeople and company executives have joined forces in an enthusiastic effort to put together what could be the largest Employee Stock Ownership Plan in the country. Under it, the Weirton steelworks, the state's largest employer and its biggest taxpayer, would be bought from the National Steel Corporation by the plant's workers.   Negotiators trying to set up an ESOP at Wierton are reportedly very close to an agreement, and ESOP leaders hope and that a plan can be completed within two weeks so that plant employees will be able to vote on it in March or April.   ''The only way out is to be competitive and that's what this ESOP is all about,'' said Jack Redline, president of the Weirton steelworks, who sees the plan as providing a lesson for industries where labor and management are at odds and which have lost competitiveness because of high labor costs."

Until now, the bank board, a Federal regulatory agency, has generally taken the position that anyone attempting an acquisition of a publicly traded thrift institution must first get advance approval from the board.   An action by Thomas P. Vartanian, general counsel of the bank board, appeared to modify this position. In giving clearance to the City Federal Savings and Loan Institution, a thrift unit with offices in Florida and New Jersey, to proceed with its hostile takeover bid for Home Federal, Mr. Vartanian said that advance approval was not needed for an acquisition so long as a merger application was filed with the bank board within 90 days of the acquisition."

The contention of the budget-shrinkers, in a nutshell, is that reducing the deficit will bring interest rates down further and thereby stimulate recovery. Lower interest rates, it is argued, will spur housing sales and construction, consumer spending on durable goods and business investment in new plant and equipment, and will aid exports by making the dollar cheaper."

Economic preoccupations may finally sway the decisions of the voters, who are expected to participate extensively in the election.  But for the country's anxious allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - and for an expectant Soviet Union - it is the crumbling of the foreign policy consensus between West Germany's two big parties that has invested Sunday's vote with such importance.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his conservative Christian Democratic Party have campaigned openly as friends of the United States and have warned that a victory by the opposition Social Democrats - in coalition with the anti-NATO Green Party - could lead West Germany on a neutralist course and threaten the Atlantic alliance.   The Social Democrats' underdog standard-bearer, Hans-Jochen Vogel, has replied that his party remains faithful to NATO and ''our American friends'' and dismisses the accusation that he is ''Moscow's candidate.''"

Andropov, the Soviet leader, took his campaign for labor discipline to the shop floor today, where, according to Tass, he bluntly told workers that the only way store shelves will fill up is if they produce the goods.   Mr. Andropov's visit to the Sergo Ordzhonikidze machine-tool factory in Moscow appeared to revive the sort of sallies favored by Nikita S. Khrushchev. Although Leonid I. Brezhnev also visited workplaces from time to time, Mr. Andropov's visit today was followed by a detailed transcript in Russian that Tass, the official press agency, said would be published in Tuesday's newspapers.   With a bare minimum of the ideological fanfare and triumphant claims that usually accompany pronouncements by Soviet leaders, Mr.  Andropov told the workers that productivity was growing at rates ''that can't satisfy us.'' Statistics for 1982 recently made public showed that output per worker grew by 2.1 percent last year, while wages grew by 2.7 percent. ''You can probably sense for yourself that our economic affairs are not going as well as we'd like,'' Mr.Andropov said."

The Pope is expected to visit the tomb of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, a critic of the military, who was slain, presumably by rightists, in March 1980 while saying mass."

''Things are looking much brighter for us,'' said John W. Sapanski, senior executive vice president of the Dime Savings Bank.

In addition, as a specific response to mounting Western European opposition to the deployment of new American medium-range missiles, Mr. Reagan asked Peter H.

After President Nixon shut the gold window in 1971, ending the convertibility of the dollar into gold at the official price of $35 an ounce, gold climbed to $197.50 in 1974, fell to a low of $103 in 1976, climbed to $850 in 1980, and is now more than halfway back to where it came from, ending yesterday at $414, a rise of $5.50 for the day. The drop in inflationary expectations, focusing on the oil price fall, is making gold dangerous to hold.   But what are the implications of the falling gold price for the world's monetary system and its economy? Some economists are worried that the post-Bretton Woods floating-rate system, with no dollar-gold link, has been first a breeder of the worst peacetime inflation the world has known and now is threatening serious deflation."

The communique offered no details of the prospective treaty, but it attacked recent American moves, thus suggesting that the pact might have been spurred by Libyan concern over tensions with the United States.   The communique alluded to an incident in mid-February, when Chad and the Sudan said Libya was massing troops with the intention of invading Chad, the Sudan, or both. The United States shifted the aircraft carrier Nimitz from waters off Lebanon to waters off Libya and it sent four radar reconnaissance planes to Egypt.

It also means that one machine will be able to use printers, disk drives, game paddles and other attachments designed for the other.   It turns out, however, that many so-called compatible computers are not really that compatible. Indeed, figuring out what compatibility means for computers is perhaps as difficult as determining what it means for people. Computers can be compatible in some things and not in others."

Not only did President Reagan become personally involved today by calling together about 20 key members of Congress to discuss El Salvador, but Secretary of State George P. Shultz also seems to have been caught up in the Salvadoran situation with almost the same intensity as his predecessor, Alexander M. Haig Jr.   Mr. Haig made El Salvador a test of East-West dimensions because of the links he saw between the Salvadoran insurgents and the Soviet Union, Cuba and Nicaragua. Mr. Shultz came into office seemingly less ideologically motivated than Mr. Haig and less interested in Salvadoran issues. Although Mr. Shultz's remarks today contained fewer rhetorical flourishes, they had no less anti-Soviet content than Mr. Haig's warnings about what would happen if El Salvador fell to the guerrillas."

Although talks sponsored by the United Nations have been held on and off over eight years, the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots seem to be moving further apart. Some young people in both sectors say they have never seen the people on the other side of the line and would not much care to.   Cyprus received its independence from Britain in 1960 and became a republic under the Greek Cypriot leader Archbishop Makarios. Even before independence it was troubled by ethnic hostilities and the traditional rivalries between Greece and Turkey."

Weinberger have raised the question whether the Administration is tilting toward the Arab moderates and away from Israel.   At one level, the answer is no. Mr. Weinberger's decision against sharing Israeli military intelligence from the Lebanese conflict, Mr. Reagan's accusing Israel of delaying the Lebanese talks, and statements by both men dramatizing the confrontation between an American Marine captain and an Israeli tank commander were tough. But they can also be explained partly as personal irritation over the fact that the Lebanese talks are getting nowhere, and as a means of pressing Israel to make concessions. How to Deal With Conflicts   At a deeper level, the answer seems to be yes - that like the Carter, Ford, and Nixon Administrations, the Reagan team came to discover that difficulties in relations with Israel arose not just because the Israelis were tough negotiators, but reflected basic conflicts of interest between the two countries."

The state's budget difficulties - including estimated deficits of $579 million in the fiscal year ending March 31 and $1.8 billion in the next fiscal year - were a major reason for seeking the insurance, which assures the bondholders of timely payment of interest and principal.   At a time when many local governments are having financial troubles, the use of such insurance has grown rapidly. Last year the Municipal Bond Insurance Association insured $3.6 billion of bonds, up from $1.2 billion in 1981. New York's was the second state bond issue insured by the association in the last two months, following a Washington State issue on Jan. 19."

But, they said, the technology that is at the heart of the argument has been tested successfully in more than 20 million miles of driving, and the only thing that remains uncertain is customer demand.   Air bags - devices that inflate to protect occupants in a head-on crash - seemed to be a good idea when they were proposed in the late 1960's. It was not long, though, before criticism and doubt began to pile up. In particular, critics said, the sodium azide that was used to generate the inflating gas was dangerous and, perhaps, carcinogenic. Further, it was said, the bags could inflict injury if they inflated inadvertently, and the cost of the complicated system would add greatly to the price of a car."

In a small compound on the topmost ridge, where a tethered camel yawns and snuffles, a 35-year-old farmer named Bullu strips a few pieces of straw from the roof of his house and arranges them in an outdoor earthen hearth.

Their judgment is based on evidence that the Soviet Union has been producing less military equipment than was expected on the basis of the American figures for Soviet spending.

This Administration has undertaken a broad agenda for peace, including special efforts in the Middle East and a program of arms control more comprehensive and far-reaching than any other in our nation's history.   In the Start negotiations on strategic weapons, we have proposed a one-half cut in missiles and a one-third cut in warheads of the most destabilizing systems - intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Ambassador Edward Rowny will soon be returning to Geneva to resume the serious negotiations underway since last July at the Start talks. And Ambassador Paul Nitze will also be returning to Geneva in a few weeks where the I.N.F. talks will resume. In the I.N.F. negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces, we have proposed the elimination of the entire class of most threatening systems - longer-range land-based missiles. In both of those negotiations, we have been encouraged by the businesslike nature of the talks and believe a serious foundation for progress has been laid."

In California, where competition for consumer accounts is especially keen, interest rates offered on the new ''money market'' accounts have dropped substantially. The Bank of America, which competed aggressively for the new accounts, offering 11 1/4 percent plus bonuses ranging from $25 to $100, had cut that to only 10 percent last week, with no bonuses."

They have ended freedom of speech in this former Dutch colony on South America's northern coast by burning down or closing all but one Government-controlled newspaper, radio station and television channel, banning all gatherings of more than three people, and creating a plainclothes militia to report to the authorities on the privately expressed views of citizens.   ''We've all had to take to lying because they're everywhere,'' said a Paramaribo taxi driver in the calypso English that many of the Dutch-speaking people of Suriname speak as a second language. ''Say the wrong thing and they call you in and make you full of holes, man.''   Although there is no evidence that people are routinely being murdered that way, there is widespread fear that that is the case, and this apprehension has given the military leader, Lieut. Col. Desi Bouterse, and his 500 to 1,000 backers sway over Suriname's 350,000 residents."

The banks attributed the delay to uncertainty about the cost of new money market accounts for consumers and the possibility of large losses from loan defaults.   The prime rate cut was widely expected because of the unusually big gap between the interest rates banks have been paying for their own funds, about 8 1/2 percent, and the interest rates they have been charging on loans to their medium-size and small corporate customers, which range upward from 11 1/2 percent.   In response to the falling cost of money, the Chase Manhattan Bank lowered its prime rate to 11 percent as early as Dec. 28, but no other major bank followed until yesterday."

The centers would serve everyone from the Sunday afternoon sailboater to the captain of the largest tanker or luxury liner.   The idea is to gather the agency's data on such things as water temperatures, wave height, tides, currents, winds and cloud cover in one place where it would be more readily available to users. The prototype of these combination store-front, telephone-bank operations, staffed mostly by oceanographers and meteorologists, is to open in Seattle in July with two more to follow by the end of the year."

None of the 12 commission members who endorsed the agreement (three did not) did so without painful concession. But the fact that all 12 members, representing an extraordinarily broad range of philosophies, made concessions, and that both President Reagan and the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., concurred in the agreement, demonstrates bipartisanship at its best.  Until Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Senator Bob Dole in early January initiated the negotiations that led to the compromise, I was frankly disappointed with the way things were going. The Republicans on the commission had all but ignored a compromise put forward informally in November by the Democrats on the commission. It appeared that another protracted, rancorous fight in Congress over the future of Social Security was in prospect. That prospect was especially frustrating because we Democrats had gone along, in the interest of compromise and prudence, with a very pessimistic Republican assessment of the scope of need."

He said one reason was the financial community's uncertainty about the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; the second was concern about huge borrowing by the Treasury to meet anticipated budget deficits.

The pro-repeal forces have charged, among other things, that savings accounts will be ''looted'' and that investors' earnings will ''disappear'' should the deductions, which are to begin July 1, take effect.   President Reagan said today that he thought the effort for repeal was ''entirely wrong.'' He added, ''I think that a great lobbying effort has resulted in much distortion.''   Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a main defender of withholding as a way to catch tax cheats, complains that the bankers' ''unscrupulous'' war of words represents a ''historic low'' in lobbying tactics.

The minister, Tomas Borge Martinez, who is a member of the Sandinists' nine-man National Directorate, said at a news conference: ''In El Salvador, the war has reached the point of seriously endangering the Government, so the United States wants to create the idea of a civil war here, too. It would then hope to negotiate the two civil wars as part of a broad Central American settlement.''   Mr. Borge, who is in charge of state security, said rightist rebel activities posed no threat to the revolutionary Nicaraguan Government. He dismissed recent assertions by the Honduras-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force that its units had recently occupied several towns in Matagalpa Province, some 60 miles north of here."

But as Mr. Silva Herzog sought to pin down foreign pledges to lend Mexico a further $5 billion and to restructure some $20 billion in outstanding debt, the prospect of a new drop in world oil prices following last weekend's OPEC meeting sent dismayed officials back to their calculators.   ''Every $1 drop in oil prices means a loss of $500 million per year for us,'' said one senior official, who asked not to be named. ''But every 1 percent drop in interest rates brings a saving of around $700 million. We can only wait and see what happens.''"

Iraq reported that its troops counterattacked and surrounded the main body of the attacking Iranian force yesterday morning after fighting through the night, and United States and other Western military sources said they believed that Iraqi reports were generally more credible than those from Iran.   The intelligence sources pointed out that Iran, in its battle reports, was saying nothing about the apparently heavy bombing raids by Iraqi planes against Dizful, an Iranian town at the center of a network of roads used to support the Iranian offensive.   Communiques broadcast by the Teheran radio said Iranian troops began a new phase in their offensive Wednesday night and ''destroyed'' the 12th Brigade of the Iraqi Third Army."

The new fare structure, combined with the recent upturn in traffic and continuing drop in fuel prices, could enable the industry to begin making money again after two years of heavy losses.   Some industry analysts warn, however, that the proposal remains fragile and that it would not take much to upset it. Pan American World Airways, according to sources close to the company, will announce today that it will not go along with the proposal, which could force exceptions to the new plan in some major markets."

The State Department announcement allows Guatemala to buy from the Defense Department $6.3 million worth of spare parts and other equipment for its air force, mostly to rehabilitate American-made helicopters for use against guerrillas.   The move, while small in military terms, was viewed by the Administration and its critics as an important symbolic step signifying support for the Government of Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who overthrew Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia and seized power last March. 'Progress Has Been Made'   Guatemala has been accused by the United States and many human rights groups of repressive tactics and rights violations. But Administration officials have reported an improvement in recent months."

The notes were sold on a delayed-payment basis, meaning that investors did not have to part with any cash until this week. The delayedpayment feature is different from the partial payment technique, in which investors put up only 20 percent or 25 percent of the price and do not pay the balance for six or nine months. In most partialpayment issues, the investors do not have to pay the balance if the price of the security drops by more than the downpayment."

The problem, however, is that the continuous price cuts have proved a barrier to maintaining profits. Given the poor retail showing at Christmas, retailers are trying to figure out ways of protecting - and perhaps increasing - profits, even as they offer lower prices."

Some said it might have a wider unintended impact.   There are Democrats who fear that the President's polemics may harm the arms-control negotiations with the Soviet Union. Others, rankled by Mr. Reagan's attack on a nuclear freeze as ''a very dangerous fraud,'' said his comments would further polarize the national debate on arms issues."

Under the zero option, the Soviet Union would be required to dismantle its medium-range missiles trained on Europe and Asia if the Atlantic alliance dropped its plan to install 572 American cruise and Pershing 2 missiles. Says 'Zero Option' Is Best   Mr. Reagan said the zero option ''remains the best and most moral outcome'' of the arms talks under way with the Soviet Union, but added that the United States is ''negotiating in good faith in Geneva, and ours is not a take-it-or-leave-it proposal.''"

President Reagan proposed the tax increase in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. Under the proposal, the Government would impose a surcharge on personal and corporate incomes and an excise tax of about $5 a barrel on oil. The taxes would not take effect unless a number of conditions were met, including a projected deficit for the fiscal year 1986 exceeding 2 1/2 percent of gross national product.   The Administration's current projections, however, indicate that it considers it most unlikely that the standby taxes can be avoided.  Even assuming a very strong recovery, one that would produce real economic growth substantially higher than the 3.5 percent average for the postwar years, the deficit would not be reduced enough to avoid the added taxes."

Though the market remains small, the American partner has made hard-won gains in virtually unexplored insurance terrain, collecting about $35 million to $40 million of an estimated $250 million in reinsurance premiums that East bloc insurance companies paid Western insurers in 1982.   ''Expansion now is going to depend on new products,'' said Nicholas C. Walsh, general manager of European American Underwriters, a joint venture of American International and its Eastern partners, in a recent conversation in Vienna.   Western European insurance executives said that American International's activity is unusual because the East's statecontrolled insurance companies usually cover only business involving ''hard'' or convertible currency, such as transport or airline service to the West."

But this time, the reasons for the industry's concerns are vastly different.   In 1981, the industry could barely contain its joy at Mr.  Johnson's appointment for a five-year term. As legal counsel for more than a decade to the Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's biggest commodity exchange, he had won high marks within the industry for his many battles with Congressional and Federal regulators. But the euphoria soon evaporated."

TO OFFER $100 MILLION IN STOCK,"  The American Motors Corporation, saying it does not expect to show a profit in the next two years, announced today that it will issue 15 million new shares of stock in coming weeks to generate $100 million for new products.   The fourth-ranked United States auto maker also said in a prospectus outlining the stock issue that it is seeking a buyer for its military vehicle unit, the AM General Corporation, which on Tuesday received a contract for the first year of a multiyear Army contract worth nearly $1.2 billion.   (An American Motors official was quoted by Reuters as saying that preliminary talks on the sale of AM General had been held with several companies, including General Dynamics, the nation's largest defense contractor. General Dynamics paid $239 million for the tank manufacturing division of Chrysler, which sold the unit because of a cash squeeze similar to A.M.C.'s.)   Joseph Broder, an analyst with Stuart Coleman & Company, said that the American Motors stock issue would temporarily depress the share price. However, he said that A.M.C.'s survival was at issue and over the long term the company could bring off a turnabout, as Chrysler had done."

Salvadoran officials share Washington's concern about how the war against the guerrillas is going, but not the sense of urgency, which seems to have grown out of the Administration's way of reacting to a crisis some officials saw coming months ago. The military situation in El Salvador deteriorated in the guerrilla offensive of January and February, which provoked few public expressions of concern by the Administration at the time. However, a recent nine-day trip to the region by Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States delegate to the United Nations, at President Reagan's request led to what officials said was anxiety in the White House.   Congressional critics say that, in dispatching Mrs. Kirkpatrick to El Salvador, Mr. Reagan received exactly what he expected to hear: that the military situation was deteriorating and that the Salvadorans needed more arms. Mrs. Kirkpatrick has a reputation within the White House as an articulate and shrewd diplomat with a hard-line approach against dealing with the left, especially in Latin America. But White House officials say even President Reagan was caught by surprise at the depth of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's concerns about possible guerrilla advances in Central America."

The battle between the different political factions has prevented either the far right or the center from seizing clear control of the country. A consequence of this, many officials here say, is that the squabbling has hindered progress toward a negotiated settlement of the three-year-old civil war or even a consensus on how the war should be fought.   While the political stuggle has led to periodic setbacks, a nascent, albeit fragile, democracy has evolved.  In March the country elected a 60-member Constituent Assembly to name a provisional president, write a constitution and determine the future of the initiatives started by the junta in 1979."

But OPEC cannot police this agreement and it seems likely that the price of oil will continue to decline.

The negotiations on the agreement were concluded nearly a month ago and the Prime Minister's office has authorized Allan Gottleib, the Canadian Ambassador in Washington, to sign an exchange of notes on the tests. At the same time the Canadians have asked the United States to be patient and wait while the Government here tries to sway public opinion to support testing.   American officials, who still expect the agreement to be signed soon, said they agreed but expressed bewilderment at the requested delay, noting that popular opposition was mounting here as church and antiwar groups focused on the cruise issue."

If Mr. Sharon chooses to accept such a position, one with Cabinet rank but no specific responsibilities, he would probably remain in the policy-making inner circle. He has not yet indicated his intentions.   As a result, the impact on Israeli-American relations and Israel's negotiations with Lebanon is not yet clear. Mr. Sharon has been an irritant in the relationship with Washington, and an adamant proponent of a significant Israeli presence in a southern Lebanese security zone, even after a withdrawal of the main Israeli forces. If Mr. Sharon, who only resigned from the defense post, not from the Cabinet, accepts Mr. Begin's offer, he would probably be influential in shaping Israel's positions."

Mr. Sprinkel made his comments at a news conference in Paris on Sunday.  Official sources here, who declined to be identified, recounted the story, which sheds some light on relationships in high places in the Treasury at a time of policy ferment in the Reagan Administration."

On national television, the President is said to have ''missed the chance.'' And in an interview, a top official blames Mr. Reagan for ''exponentially expanding deficits of gargantuan proportions.''   These are not the words of the far left, or even the Democratic opposition. Rather, they come from bastions of the business community: Five former Treasury Secretaries and 500 prominent businessmen who have formed a new organization to bring changes in Mr. Reagan's economic program, and such leading business groups as the American Business Conference and the National Association of Manufacturers.   After two years of giving President Reagan their staunch support, business and financial executives - who had hailed the sweeping tax cuts of the President's first year and stuck with him as the recession deepened in the second -are now raising their voices to criticize his policies and, in some cases, even call for increased taxes. They are not abandoning the President but they are recommending that the course be changed, not stayed."

Pravda specifically blamed the Agriculture Ministry, the State Committee for Agricultural Machinery, fruit and vegetable enterprises and many party and Government organizations ''for not creating the necessary work pressure in preparation for the spring.''"

Schottenstein, an expert at liquidating failing retail stores, maintains he has been unfairly tarred over the years as a kind of exploiter of others' misfortunes. But now, in his new role as chairman of Wieboldt's, the venerable Chicago department store chain, he has a chance to show he can also nurse an ailing business back to health.   Liquidators, who buy a troubled company's inventories and sell them at reduced prices, sometimes get ''a bad rap,'' as Mr. Schottenstein put it, because some people blame them rather than management for the closing of stores or other businesses.   Thus his appointment at Wieboldt's may seem odd and even portentious to some. But the chunky, intense Mr. Schottenstein disagrees. For one thing, he says, his company, the Schottenstein Stores Corporation, acquired a 15 percent stake in Wieboldt's as part of a group that won control of the chain in a proxy fight."

Few banks have announced what they will pay on the Super NOW's, but the return is expected to range between 6 percent and 9 percent.   Those rates, however, will no reflect the final yield to consumers, because most banks are expected to charge hefty fees to offset the costs of the service. Under the regulations, customers must keep at least $2,500 in the new accounts. If the balance falls below that level, the interest paid drops to 5 1/4 percent. 'Not So Super'"

The mutiny, directed against President Nyerere's leadership, was rapidly quashed by loyalists. One of those reportedly detained was Christopher Ngaiza, a former presidential aide who had been linked to a prominent Tanzanian dissident, Oscar Kambona, now in exile in London. The uprising was short-lived and confused, the diplomats said."

And they became even more enthusiastic over news that the nation's leading indicators had climbed 3.6 percent in January, the largest monthly gain since July 1950. An 8.9 percent rise in construction spending during the month - the biggest since March 1946 - and a 9.9 percent increase in single-family home sales seemed proof positive that the recession was over.  The stock market marched higher. The Dow Jones Industrial average set records almost every day on the strength of high-tech, bluechip, retail-store and rebounding oil stocks. It finally closed Friday at 1,140.96, up 20.02 points on the week. Even gold stocks recovered from the losses they suffered after bullion fell $100 an ounce on fears that slumping oil revenues would force Arab nations to sell their gold. Though the soaring economic barometers were warmly welcomed, falling oil prices still carried the day.

The general intent of the alternative minimum tax, or the A.M.T., is to require some payments from every taxpayer with substantial income, even if part or all of such income would not ordinarily be taxable, as in the case of long-term capital gains. It is calculated separately from the regular tax, and the portion of the alternative minimum tax payable is the excess over that regular tax."

It would be the most significant price break since OPEC members failed last month to reach agreement on prices and production quotas.   Such a decline, coming on the heels of reductions in the Soviet Union, the United States and Egypt, would put extreme pressure on Nigeria and Libya, whose oil most resembles North Sea crude. Oil traders and stock analysts here agreed that Norway would immediately follow the lead of the state-owned B.N.O.C. and that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would also lower prices in a matter of weeks."

He sits on i ts board of directors and has more than 7,800 people in his charge a nd a spacious office on the 37th floor of One Liberty Plaza in l ower Manhattan. Mr. Nigro is, in fact, a paradigm for his p rofession - a one-time computer programmer who was able to break o ut of strict information processing and into high-level management o f a major corporation.   The prospects for management-level jobs for computer programmers and systems analysts have, in the past, been limited almost entirely to computer departments. But this seems to be changing. As computers enter almost every corner of business, the executive with a broad grounding in the area will have more and more of an edge over his or her uninitiated colleague. Moreover, the explosion in demand for computer systems is creating a disproportionate number of new managerial positions in what is often called management information services, or M.I.S."

More than 300 of the 435 members of the House of Representatives and more than half the 100 Senators have co-sponsored repeal bills.

The Tass item was one of a very few reporting on the talks since they resumed here March 1, following initial discussions held in Peking last fall.

The agencies - in foreign aid circles they are commonly referred to as the ''P.V.O.'s,'' meaning private, voluntary organizations - spend $1.8 billion a year overseas in carrying out foreign aid programs in at least 100 countries.   But officials are increasingly concerned about stretching limited funds to meet increasing demands for food, medicine and other commodities. They say they are uneasy about the growing competition for the charitable dollar. The groups, esteemed abroad for decades of humanitarian help, worry that the value of their work goes unnoticed by Congressional budget makers and private donors because they lack ''visibility''on the domestic scene."

Two independent Israeli military analysts, in direct contact with senior officials of the Israeli Army and intelligence agencies, say that there is mounting repugnance among Israeli officers over working with the militiamen in light of the Phalangists' massacre of Palestinians in Beirut refugee camps.   This is coupled with a growing feeling among members of Israel's military and political establishments that the Phalangists used the Israelis to do their dirty work but failed to ''deliver the goods'' in the form of a peace treaty between Lebanon and Israel - even though their party's candidate, Amin Gemayel, is President of Lebanon. 'Perfumed Soldiers'   ''The view of the Phalangists among Israeli officers,'' the military analysts said, ''is that they are 'perfumed soldiers,' ready to fight to the last Israeli.''   Today's resignation of the Israeli Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon, is expected by Israeli military analysts to erode relations further between the Phalangists and the Israeli Army. The Phalangists and other Christian politicians have complaints of their own about the Israelis. ''The friendly relations that used to exist between Israel and the Lebanese Christians are not there anymore,'' former President Camille Chamoun, a Phalangist ally, said in an interview."

Instead of gathering in the 114-year-old company's corporate board room, R. Gordon McGovern, Campbell's president, carted off his directors to two New Jersey supermarkets.   His message was simple: The competition in the aisles was fierce, and while Campbell understands and dominates the market for condensed soup, the same can't be said about Campbell shrimp, spaghetti, scallops, scrambled eggs and a whole litany of other new products.   Mr. McGovern has been trying to shake up the sleepy company ever since the grocery store rendezvous, concentrating on the company's lagging marketing operations while at the same time embarking on a $75 million acquisition drive that has added more than 100 products to Campbell's list over the last two years.   ''I want to be across the whole store, as well as in the institutional and restaurant businesses,'' said the lanky 56-year-old Mr. McGovern, who has been trying for two years to shed the company's soup-only image and to regain ground that Campbell has lost to its archrival - H.J. Heinz."

This holds true for data processing, a technical area that is increasingly indispensable to the widespread sales and inventory requirements of retailers.   While the processes may be similar, corporate policies may vary widely. For example, Sears Roebuck & Company, the world's largest retailer, will be hiring between 40 and 100 new people a year in the next few years for its data-processing operations. But few will need computer-science degrees, since Sears has found that math, English and home-economics majors - and its own people - fit its training and salary requirements better."

Both were the smallest gains since World War II and were well below Moscow's modest targets of 4.7 percent and 3 percent, respectively.   The figures came as little surprise to Western analysts who have been following the sluggish pace of the Soviet economy in monthly tabulations.

At the Polski Fiat auto plant, Henryk Kordleczek and Janusz Czakow, the chief organizers for the new Government-sponsored unions that are to take the place of Solidarity, the banned independent labor organization, say their fellow workers have painted their doors red, made threatening telephone calls and sent them nasty letters.   Then, when they passed on a grievance from the workers over proposed legislation that would reduce paid sick leave for absences of three days or less, the authorities brushed them aside and the unpopular bill was enacted anyway.   ''People who have weak nerves would have to leave this task,'' Mr.  Kordlec@zek, a welding foreman, said."
