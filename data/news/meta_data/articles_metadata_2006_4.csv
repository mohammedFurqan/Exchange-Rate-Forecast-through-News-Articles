Gryzlov, later said that the president’s proposal would restrict all gambling to four unpopulated regions: two in European Russia, one in Siberia and one in the Far East. He provided few other details of the legislation, but the changes, if enacted, would affect a burgeoning industry worth billions of dollars."

The press freedom group Reporters Without Borders expressed concern this month that not renewing RCTV’s license when it expires in March could curtail editorial diversity in Venezuela, where newspapers and television stations supporting Mr. Chávez have grown more powerful in recent years. The tension between Mr. Chávez and some private media groups dates from their tacit approval of a coup that briefly ousted him in 2002. “There will be no new concession for that coup-plotting television channel named Radio Caracas Televisión,” Mr. Chávez said."

As airlines fill more seats and raise fares and hotels in business centers continue raising already high rates, companies are being advised by American Express Business Travel to “tighten travel policies.” That means less flexibility in choice for business travelers, as corporate managers emphasize channeling spending to the volume discount deals negotiated with airlines and hotel chains. “Compliance to policy and tighter controls are necessary,” said Mike Streit, a vice president at the American Express subsidiary. Published domestic coach air fares are expected to rise 3 to 5 percent next year, American Express said. Domestic hotel rates will rise about 3 to 6 percent for midrange rooms and 4 to 8 percent for upper-range accommodations, but watch out for big cities. Average room rates in New York, which are already at record highs, could go up as much as 18 percent because of surging demand and sluggish growth in supply."

You recently spent a day working from home, and you can't believe how much you accomplished. How do you persuade your boss to permit this arrangement on a more permanent basis?    A. It may not be easy. Jeff Davidson, president of the Breathing Space Institute, a time management consulting firm in Chapel Hill, N.C., said that unless your boss already managed a number of employees who worked from home, he probably would not embrace your suggestion right away.     ''Corporate cultures are steeped in ritual,'' he said. ''If working from home isn't part of that ritual, you need to deal with the fact that it may take time to get what you want.''    Q. How do you know if working from home is right for you?    A. The arrangement obviously doesn't fit every job. If you operate heavy machinery or work in a laboratory, fulfilling day-to-day responsibilities outside the workplace may be hard. Sales, management and other positions that require face-to-face interaction with other people may also prove challenging if you're home alone.  "

Then again, it could decide not to decide; the deal is on a meeting agenda for Friday, but the F.C.C. has postponed the decision more than once. At issue is whether the commissioners ought to impose any conditions on the deal, and, if so, what they should be. The transaction, which would bring under one corporate roof the dominant telephone companies in California, Texas, the Midwest and much of the South, has been approved by both companies' shareholders, state regulators and the Justice Department.

They will be reading some clues on Monday, when the Commerce Department will offer figures for September on personal income, personal spending and the personal consumption expenditures deflator (derived from personal spending statistics excluding food and energy prices). In August, consumers held back, spending only 0.1 percent more than in July, the smallest month-to-month increase since November; analysts polled by Bloomberg predict that the figure for September will be higher, at 0.3 percent.

TOP STORY  CRIMINAL BANKING SYNDICATE UNCOVERED: The economic security department of the Russian Interior Ministry announced on Tuesday that a criminal gang in control of several Moscow banks was involved in a massive money laundering and illegal monetization scheme, the major newspapers reported. The group laundered close to $7 billion in about half a year, sending the money to Europe, the United States and former Soviet states, the newspapers wrote.     Kommersant reported that the criminal syndicate, with ''ethnic and financial ties to criminal agents in the Georgian diaspora, had infiltrated eight banks. Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote that two principal banks were involved in money laundering, along with another 10 credit institutions. The newspaper also reported on the involvement of several nongovernmental organizations, including the Educational Union, Harmony and the Foundation for the Support of Invalids and Veterans.     The criminal organization consisted of 10 people and was headed by a Georgian, Dzhumber Elbakidze, also know as Dzuba, Kommersant reported. The interior ministry said that Mr. Elbakidze, a Tbilisi native, had links to Georgian veterans of the Abkhaz war and with Russian criminal organizations, the newspaper reported. Kommersant also said that Mr. Elbakidze may have been involved with the Finance Ministry, the Russian Bank and law enforcement.     The Central Bank last year revoked the licenses of the two principle banks involved in the money laundering scheme, Izvestia reported. Andrei Kozlov, the slain deputy head of the Central Bank oversaw the revocations, which, Izvestia speculated, may have led to his murder. Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote that the fight against illegal monetization began several years ago when the Central Bank strengthened regulations over cash withdrawals by companies looking to circumvent tax payments.      Kommersant reported that the Interior Ministry had not yet filed charges in the case and expressed skepticism about whether any members of the criminal gang, most of whom now live abroad, would be brought to justice. The whereabouts of the group's leader, Mr. Elbakidze is unclear. Kommersant wrote that he was in Russia, while Gazeta said he was abroad. Gazeta also wrote that law enforcement agencies from Germany, Austria, Latvia, Lithuania, Israel and Switzerland took part in the investigation.    IN OTHER NEWS    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  INVENTOR OF LIVE JOURNAL ARRIVES IN MOSCOW: --The 26-year-old American inventor of the enormously popular blog portal, Live Journal, arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, most likely for promotional reasons. Russia has about 400,000 Live Journal users, including many journalists, businessmen and political activists. Many users consider it an ideal platform for political ranting, gossip and virtual provocations since, with its server located in the United States, it is difficult, if not impossible, for Russian law enforcement to infiltrate.    GAZETA  ACQUITTALS ABOUND: A St. Petersburg court on Tuesday acquitted all 5 defendants accused of murdering a Vietnamese student in October 2004. According to defense lawyers, the jury found that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused. In a separate trial, the court acquitted 8 defendants and found a further 9 guilty of hate crimes in connection with the beating of a Palestinian and Chinese student, the robbery of a citizen from Ghana and an attack on an Azerbaijani citizen. A trial earlier this year on the murder of a Congolese student also ended in complete acquittal for those charged.    KOMMERSANT  PRO-RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA ABROAD: The state-run newspaper, Rossiiskaya Gazeta, is launching a large-scale international propaganda project to boost Russia's image abroad. The publication has signed agreements with The Washington Post, The Daily Telegraph and the Chinese People's Daily on the publication of the newspaper's supplements, and plans to publish in further nine countries soon. The informational supplement will highlight Russia's attractive investment climate, culture, historical value and sports successes.    VREMYA NOVOSTEI  EUROPEAN RESOLUTION SUPPORTS GEORGIANS: The European Union passed a harsh resolution on Tuesday calling on Russia to stop harassing Georgians on its territory, and raised concerns over Russia's blockade of Georgia. The European Union also expressed its serious concern about the economic, political and humanitarian effects of the measures taken by Russia against Georgia. The newspaper said that the resolution may impact negatively on President Vladimir V. Putin's meetings with the European Union at a summit on Oct. 20.  "

The fund's woes reveal a painful truth: hedge fund investing is hard, and no one -- not even Goldman Sachs -- is infallible. [Page C1.]    A BREAK FOR SMALL COMPANIES -- The Securities and Exchange Commission will begin the process of easing auditing standards for thousands of smaller public companies this week when it proposes rules under the most contentious provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The relaxed standards represent a qualified victory for the business lobby and for the auditing firms in their fight over new financial safeguards. [C1.]    CD SALES NO LONGER DEFINE A HIT -- Selling a half-million CD's or more in the first week no longer defines a hit in pop music. Instead, a hit arrives with solid if less impressive sales with multiple revenue streams -- like ''Konvicted,'' the new CD from Akon, which sold more than 283,000 copies in its first week. Digital music services sold more than 244,000 copies combined of two of the tracks, and a week later snippets of the same songs sold 269,000 ring tones. It's an example of the business model the music industry is embracing as the CD, its mainstay product for two decades, slowly decays. [C1.]    SHOPPING FRAUD GOES ONLINE -- The holiday season typically brings a surge in the number of fraudulent orders, and thieves seem to have shifted techniques this year to combat tightened security practices among bigger merchants.

''They're trying to slip more transactions through,'' said Tom Sullivan, above, chairman of the Merchant Risk Council, an antifraud group that represents about 100 online retailers.

[C4.]    PUSHING ADS AT COMPUTER VIEWERS -- In an effort to maximize advertising revenue, some online publishers are using pop-ups to push their content to computer users who are visiting other sites.

TOP STORIES    KOMMERSANT  POTENTIAL SUSPECTS IN POLITKOVSKAYA CASE: Investigators in the case of Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian journalist murdered Oct. 7, have identified two former police officers from Nizhevartovsk as possible suspects. Ms. Politkovskaya published several works between 2002 and 2005 accusing the two officers and their colleague, Sergei Lapin, of kidnapping and murdering a 30-year-old Chechen man in January 2001. Mr. Lapin was sentenced in March to 11 years in prison. The two other officers remain on the run, and are currently the subject of an international manhunt.    RUSSIA SCORES LOW ON PRESS FREEDOMS: The international organization, Reporters Without Borders, ranked Russia 147th out of 168 countries on its annual report on press freedom. Russia fell 10 places from last year, coming in just above Belarus. Among the main reasons for the decline is not simply that three journalists were murdered in 2006, but that these murders remained unsolved. Reporters Without Borders also expressed concern over the purchase of Russian media -- including Kommersant this year -- by major industrial companies.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  DUMA GOES AFTER N.G.O. FINANCES: Several State Duma deputies proposed legislation on Monday that would require nongovernmental organizations to invest any financial donations exceeding $112,000, for example, in stocks and real estate, rather than spending donor money outright. The bill's sponsors say this will yield continual earnings and weed out those organizations that fail to be financially competitive. Critics in the N.G.O. sector said the law would allow large business interests greater influence over the activities of independent organizations.    GAZETA  ONE LANGUAGE, DIFFERENT ACCENTS: On the opening day of the Global Conference of Compatriots in St. Petersburg on Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin said that in 2006 the government designated $12 million to support Russians abroad and pledged to allocate a further $750,000 next year. These funds should be directed toward legal protections for Russians abroad, treatment for veterans of World War II, building Russian theaters, and aiding Russians' return to their homeland, Mr. Putin said. Russians abroad were most in need of political and economic support, according to foreign delegations.    GEORGIA TO DENOUNCE RUSSIA ON INTERNATIONAL STAGE: The Georgian Parliament unanimously passed a resolution creating a temporary commission to study Russian actions against Georgia, the results of which will be turned over to the European Commission. Meanwhile, the Georgian Justice Ministry is preparing an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights over what it says are violations by the Russian government of Georgian citizens' rights. Georgia's president said he would also take his country's case against Russia to a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    VREMYA NOVOSTEI  UKRAINE GETS GAS GUARANTEE:RosUkrEnergo, an energy company controlled jointly by Russia's Gazprom and a Ukrainian businessman, announced on Tuesday that it would guarantee Ukraine 55 billion cubic meters of gas in 2007 at a price if $130 per thousand cubic meters. Ukraine's opposition leader, Yulia V. Tymoshenko called the price ''criminal.'' The 35 percent increase from $95 that Ukraine now pays, however, could have been between 100 and 150 percent, the newspaper wrote.    RUSSIA ARRESTS SUSPECTED SPY: Russia's internal intelligence service announced Tuesday it had arrested a 39-year-old justice official from Kaliningrad on charges that he had passed military secrets to the Lithuanian government in exchange for money. It was unclear whether counterintelligence officials had located the suspect's interlocutors in the Russian military, who investigators said passed him information. Lithuania's prime minister denied that the justice official, who may be a Lithuanian citizen, worked for the government as a spy.    NOVYE IZVESTIA  AUTHORITIES REJECT ''UNFASHIONABLE'' CLOTHES: The newspaper reported that the Education Ministry in the Sverdlovsk region refused a donation of new clothing by the Red Cross to local orphanages because the clothes were out of fashion. An official with the ministry said that ''we try to dress our children in the best clothing.'' A representative from the Red Cross in the region, and an orphanage director interviewed by the newspaper, said that local orphanages were in dire need of clothing. According to the director of the organization, Children's Rights, the situation in regional orphanages is so poor that many children have no choice but to run away from them.  "

Asian countries, in particular, are clamoring for planes to meet their surging air travel demands -- last week, Korean Air Lines ordered 25 Boeing jets. But Boeing is leery of overcommitting itself, a mistake it made -- and paid dearly for -- in the last airline boom. [Page C1.]    STOCKS TAKE A TUMBLE Concerns about a weak holiday shopping season combined with broader anxiety about an economic slowdown, handing Wall Street its biggest decline in four months. Retailers like Wal-Mart, whose year-over-year sales fell in November, suffered some of the steepest losses. [C1.]    FORD AT BANK, ASSETS IN HAND -- Ford Motor Company essentially mortgaged nearly all of its domestic assets, including factories, office buildings, patents and trademarks, to raise $18 billion to pay for several more years of painful restructuring. Other auto companies have put up manufacturing equipment and other collateral to secure loans, but Ford has never done so. [C1.]    A DECLINE IN AMERICANs' INCOME -- The income that Americans reported to the tax collector in 2004, adjusted for inflation, was below its peak in 2000, government data showed. Average real incomes declined $1,641, or 3 percent, to $53,974. [C1.]    CERTIFYING THE CATCH OF THE DAY -- What makes a fish organic? The Agriculture Department's answer could determine whether Americans will be able to add fish to the growing list of organic foods they are buying, and whether fish farmers will be able to tap into that trend. [A1.]    WAL-MART TO ENTER INDIA -- Wal-Mart announced a joint venture with an Indian partner, Bharti Enterprises, with which it will open hundreds of Wal-Mart-branded superstores across India over the next five years, starting in 2007. [C3.]    RIGHTING AN OLD WRONG -- The Supreme Court took up the question of how to treat a discriminatory action that happened long ago but that has effects that continue to the present day. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has long considered each pay period of uncorrected discrimination as a fresh incident of discrimination. But the Bush administration has disavowed the commission's position, and has entered the case on the employer's behalf. [A20.]    A TEMPLE TO GAZPROM -- Gazprom City, a proposed complex in St. Petersburg, Russia, would include a main tower soaring three or four times higher than the city's most famous landmark, drawing heated protests from the director of the Hermitage Museum and the head of the city's architects' union. But Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled energy company, is determined to press ahead. [A4.]    YOUTUBE ON CELLPHONES, FOR A FEE -- YouTube is coming to mobile phones. But unlike users of its explosively popular Internet service, users of Youtube's phone-based version must subscribe to a $15-a-month Verizon Wireless service, and the videos will be preselected and approved. [C3.]    BROUGHT TO YOU BYMadison Avenue is playing matchmaker to Match.com and the TBS Network for season-long sponsorship of a sitcom, a deal that recalls the brand-name sponsorships of a bygone era. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C8.]    JUSTICES REJECT SMOKERS' APPEAL -- The Supreme Court refused to revive a $10.1 billion award against Philip Morris USA, rejecting an appeal from smokers who said they were misled about the health risks of ''light'' cigarettes. [C3.]    TWO RESIGN IN OPTIONS INQUIRY -- The chief executive and chief financial officer of Affiliated Computer Services resigned after a board investigation into stock option grant practices. The company said the board concluded that ''certain conduct'' of the two men violated its code of ethics. [C8.]    MORE FOR RETIRED DELTA PILOTS -- Delta Air Lines has agreed to give its retired pilots an additional $719 million in unsecured claims in its bankruptcy case to help them recoup losses from the termination of the pilot pension plan. [C4.]    TRUCK CARRIER REBUFFS BID -- The Swift Transportation Company, the truckload carrier, rejected a $2.2 billion takeover offer from its founder and largest shareholder, but said that it planned to explore other alternatives. [C3.]    LAWSUIT OVER BIG DIG IN BOSTON -- Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly of Massachusetts said he would file a civil lawsuit against 12 companies that designed, constructed, managed and oversaw work on a Big Dig tunnel, saying their negligence caused its ceiling tiles to collapse in July, killing a Boston woman. Mr. Reilly, above, accused managers of identifying problems ''very early on,'' but of failing to fix them before turning over the tunnel to the state. [A19.]    ONLINE    GIVING -- A new generation of billionaire business people are trying to harness marketplace forces to do good works. A special report is at nytimes.com/giving.    DIGITAL HOLIDAYS -- Designers and engineers have come up with new devices, scores of which will reach store shelves in time for the holidays.

HIGH-TECH SNEAKERS -- Nike and Adidas have introduced sneakers that communicate wirelessly with other technology to provide information about a run.

Deutsche Telekom named René Obermann, above, to replace Kai-Uwe Ricke, who submitted his resignation Sunday after losing the confidence of big shareholders. [Page C1.]    INTERNET VIA SATELLITE -- Companies like WildBlue and Hughes Network Systems, which provide Internet service via satellite, are filling one of the biggest gaps in the country's digital infrastructure. Roughly 15 million households cannot get broadband from their phone or cable provider because the companies have been slow to expand their high-speed networks in areas where there are not enough customers to generate an adequate profit. [C1.]    BIG PAYDAY AT GOLDMAN -- Traders at Wall Street investment banks are priming themselves for another big bonus haul this year. And Raanan A. Agus, manager of one of Goldman Sachs' largest internal hedge funds will be in line for one of the firm's richer paydays. He is evidence that the real money on Wall Street is being made not by investment bankers cutting high-profile deals, but by anonymous traders making risky, bets with their firm's capital. [C1.]    VALUE OF METS DEAL -- Experts in the realms of sports marketing, corporate identity and brand building offered sharply divergent views of the value of the huge deal that will name the new ballpark of the New York Mets for Citigroup. Under the deal, the new Mets stadium, scheduled to open in spring 2009, will be called Citi Field. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C5.]    IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE -- The Mets stadium deal could have been worse. The new ballpark could have been named for some company overcharging in Iraq or a scandalized corporation or a geeky-sounding electronics firm that may or may not still exist when the gates open in 2009. Sports of the Times: George Vecsey [D1.]    READY FOR BOARDING -- Airlines have been boarding passengers for decades, long enough, it would seem, to have figured out the best way to get people on and off a plane. But they haven't. Spurred by financial pressures and packed planes, airlines have come up with a wide variation of boarding techniques, from the simple back-to-front protocol to much more complicated strategies. The goal is to get planes back in the air faster. [C1.]    BATTLE OVER HEALTH PLAN -- A legal battle over a plan to offer free or low-cost health care to all uninsured residents in San Francisco has been set in motion by a group of the city's most important and beloved constituents: restaurants. A culinary trade group with more than 800 members has sued the city, saying a central provision in the program violates federal employment law. [A14.]    FEDERAL HEALTH PLAN -- The health insurance industry has proposed an expansion of Medicaid and new tax breaks with the goal of guaranteeing coverage for all children in three years and for virtually all adults within 10 years. New members of Congress, especially those elected on a pledge to help the uninsured, are likely to embrace many of the proposals, which provide a benchmark for debate on the issue. [A14.]    MEN'S HEALTH -- In recent years, women's health has been a national priority. Pink ribbons warn of breast cancer. Pins shaped like red dresses raise awareness about heart disease. Yet statistics show that men are more likely than women to suffer an early death. Now some scientists are beginning to ask a question that in some circles might be considered politically incorrect: Is men's health getting short shrift? [F1.]    VIETNAM TRADE VOTE -- Legislation to normalize trade relations with Vietnam was defeated in the House, four days before President Bush makes his first visit to the country. The measure failed to win the necessary two-thirds majority it needed to pass under a procedure adopted in an effort to rush it through with limited debate. The measure will be voted on again, possibly as early as today, under normal procedures which will require only a majority for passage. [C1.]    MICROSOFT ALLIANCE -- Microsoft plans to unveil a technology industry alliance today to make software from competing companies and partners work better together. The move is latest effort by Microsoft to move from being a company that insists on the advantages of its own products to one that can adapt when customers use other companies' goods. The alliance will be announced in Barcelona, Spain, at an event for European software developers. [C3.]    NEW TIVO FEATURES -- TiVo plans to introduce features that will allow people to use its digital video recorders to watch some video programming from the Internet on their televisions. Until now, TiVo has not been able to tap into the explosion of Web video Internet. The new features, to be announced today, are designed to change that. [C3.]    LOSSES AT MEAT PROCESSOR -- Tyson Foods, the world's biggest meat processor, reported its third straight quarterly loss because of lower chicken and beef prices. Tyson said it would return to profit in 2007 and its stock price posted the biggest one-day gain since July. [C11.]    HEDGE FUND SCRUTINY -- The Securities and Exchange Commission expects to file more lawsuits aimed at hedge funds accused of illegal trading and violating their clients' trust, the agency's chief enforcer said.

Simpson, in which he hypothesizes about how he could have committed the 1994 murder of his wife, said that she was told the advance and royalties for the book would go to Mr. Simpson's children, not to him. The publisher, Judith Regan, said she believed the book was ''a confession'' by Mr. Simpson to committing the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. [Page C1]    MILTON FRIEDMAN DIES -- Milton Friedman, the grandmaster of free-market economic theory in the postwar era and a prime force in the movement of nations toward less government and greater reliance on individual responsibility, died in San Francisco, where he lived. Conservative and liberal colleagues alike viewed Mr. Friedman, a Nobel laureate, as one of the 20th century's leading economic scholars.

[C1]    FURTHER DROP IN OIL -- Oil prices fell to their lowest level in a year as oil traders expressed doubt that OPEC members would carry out their recent deal to trim production.

After four decades of decline, executives say the department store has again become a destination for shoppers. [A1]    BUSH IN VIETNAM -- President Bush begins a 72-hour visit to Vietnam, linked to an annual Asian summit for which the Communist government in Vietnam is the host. Following Republican losses in Congressional elections and the deteriorating situation in Iraq, White House officials concede the visit is poorly timed. [A12]    ENERGY IN MYANMAR -- In the balmy waters of the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast of Myanmar, an Asian energy rush is on. Huge pockets of natural gas have been found. China and India are jostling to sign deals. Plans are afoot to spend billions on new ports and pipelines. Yet onshore not a light is to be seen. People receive two hours of electricity a day from a military government that is among the world's most repressive. [A1]    MEDIA FIRMS IN PRIVATE HANDS -- Some of the largest broadcasters and publishers are being swept into the arms of private equity firms. The trend could raise new regulatory concerns, however, as some of the big private equity firms start to weave a complex web of cross-ownerships in the industry. The latest example is Clear Channel Communications, which has agreed to be acquired for $18.7 billion by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital. [C1]    CITIGROUP'S CHINA BANK DEAL -- A group of investors led by Citigroup reached a deal to pay about $3.1 billion for a controlling stake in the Guangdong Development Bank, the first time a foreign-led consortium has won the right to manage a major Chinese bank. The deal came after more than a year of intense negotiation with the Chinese government and a contentious bidding war. [C9]    HEWLETT-PACKARD PROFIT -- In a quarter in which it struggled with revelations about corporate spying, Hewlett-Packard still managed to post sharp gains in profit and revenue. Net income for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 rose 27 percent to $1.7 billion, or 60 cents a share, from adjusted amounts a year earlier. Revenue increased 7 percent. [C4]    ICAHN BID FOR RECKSON -- Days before shareholders of Reckson Associates Realty were scheduled to vote on the company's sale to another publicly traded Midtown office landlord, the investor Carl C. Icahn and the privately held Macklowe Properties have submitted a $4.6 billion offer that tops the earlier bid. [C7]    Business Briefing  Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.    Jason Calacanis, the outspoken blogger and entrepreneur who ran AOL's Netscape division, resigned yesterday in the wake of the firing of AOL's chief executive, Jonathan Miller. (NYT)    The Starbucks Corporation said that its fourth-quarter profit slipped 5 percent, blaming the dip on new accounting changes. For the 13 weeks that ended Oct. 1, Starbucks, the world's largest specialty coffee retailer, posted net earnings of $117.3 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $123.7 million, or 16 cents a share, for a year ago. (AP)    Taco Bell will eliminate or reduce trans fats from cooking oils in its American restaurants, the company announced yesterday, making it the latest fast-food chain to do so. Taco Bell, the nation's largest seller of quick-service Mexican-style foods, uses the oils to fry its nachos, taco salad shells, potatoes, chalupa shells and other items. (AP)    Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, said it would begin selling certain generic prescription drugs for $4 in 11 new states, bringing the total to 38 states. Wal-Mart, which started the $4 generic drug program in Florida in September, said it was now available in Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Washington and West Virginia.

After years of investment losses and double-digit increases in health care costs, some are now regretting it as their funds for retiree health care and overall pensions are running out. [Page A1.]    GOVERNOR WARNS OF CRISIS Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey said that he was considering a ''serious restructuring'' of pension and health care benefits for state employees because soaring costs would make it impossible for the state to keep pace over the next decade. [B5.]    EYES ON THE CORNER OFFICE As early as today, Delta Air Lines will file its plan to operate after bankruptcy. Delta's argument to remain independent and fend off an $8.5 billion bid from US Airways will also make the case by extension for Edward H. Bastian and James M. Whitehurst, the two executives running Delta, to keep their jobs -- and for one of them, perhaps, to become chief executive.

[C1.]    EX-EDITOR SPARS WITH NEWS CORP. Judith Regan's authors are still reeling from their publisher's abrupt dismissal, and the sparring between the headline-making Ms. Regan and her former employer, the News Corporation, has grown more intense, more personal and more specific over accusations that she had made anti-Semitic comments that prompted her firing. [C1.]    TRANSIT PROJECTS TO GET AID After decades of planning and dreaming by officials, two major expansions of New York City's mass transit system took important steps forward, with the federal government promising to pay billions of dollars for a Long Island Rail Road connection to Grand Central Terminal and for a Second Avenue subway. [B1.]    OFFER PUTS PRESSURE ON UNIONS A group of private equity firms said that they were willing to invest up to $3.4 billion in the Delphi Corporation when it emerges from Chapter 11, but the offer hinges on Delphi's reaching a new labor agreement with its unions by Jan. 31.

[C10.]    LILLY RAISES OFFER FOR ICOS Eli Lilly raised its offer for the Icos Corporation by 6 percent, to $34 a share, or $2.3 billion, in advance of a vote on the deal that two proxy firms were advising against. [C10.]    AOL PLANS FOR THE LONG HAUL Randy Falco, the new chief executive of AOL, made his first move to demonstrate that the company was not for sale and was making plans for the long haul. Mr. Falco, left, reorganized the executive suite so that eight people are reporting directly to him, including AOL's vice chairman, Ted Leonsis, along with functions like human resources, legal and finance. [C1.]    MINING COMPANY SELLS SHARES The largest gold mining company in Russia, Polyus, listed shares on the London Stock Exchange, three weeks after a market scare in London that the Kremlin had begun a program to nationalize Siberia's gold fields. [C12.]    ONLINE    Business Briefing  Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.    The Broadcom Corporation, a chip maker, said that the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened a formal investigation into the company's options practices. The company also said that it canceled more than $37 million in stock options held by three unnamed individuals who it holds responsible for manipulating their grant dates.

The surprise offer may presage a wave of mergers in the struggling airline industry, but must first overcome several large hurdles, including antitrust scrutiny and the apparent lack of support of Delta's management. US Airway's chief executive, Doug Parker, above, is a longtime proponent of airline consolidation. [Page A1]    STUBBORN COMPETITOR -- Don't write off US Airways. In the last four years, it has filed for bankruptcy twice, faced extinction from discount airlines, been bled nearly dry by soaring fuel prices and entered a merger that critics said would not work. It emerged from these trials scarred but with a re-energized business strategy that emboldened it to make an offer for Delta. [C1]    TOYOTA'S BIG TRUCK -- Toyota's cautious approach to the pickup market is coming to an end. Toyota officially opens its $1.2 billion assembly plant in San Antonio tomorrow. The plant will make the biggest version yet of Toyota's Tundra pickup, which goes on sale Feb. 12. [C1]    A BIGGER CASINO -- Mohegan Sun, already one of the largest casino resorts in the country, will unveil plans to spend $740 million on a major expansion that will include a 1,000-room hotel, a new casino and more stores and restaurants. The resort's goal is to remain competitive with the neighboring Foxwood's Resort Casino as well as casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. [B8]    NEW HEART RISK -- A medical study to be released today suggests that high doses of a best-selling drug used to treat anemia in dialysis and cancer patients may increase the risk of heart problems and deaths. Almost a million Americans are annually prescribed the drug, known as epoetin, or a closely related drug, darbepoetin, for anemia. [C1]    EXCHANGE BID DROPPED -- Deutsche Börse, parent company of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, abandoned its goal of buying Euronext, the pan-European stock and derivatives exchange. The move increases the chances of the New York Stock Exchange's planned acquisition of Euronext will be completed. [C14]    IMMIGRATION MEASURES -- In a sign of rising passions over immigration issues, Texas lawmakers prepared for the 2007 session this week by filing a flurry of bills that would deny public assistance and other benefits to the children of illegal immigrants, tax money transfers to Mexico and Latin America and sue the federal government for the costs of state border control. [A22]    TRADE BILLS IN TROUBLE -- The failure by the House this week to approve a bill to extend normal trade relations to Vietnam showed the likely difficulty of winning approval of such bills. Lobbyists said that the administration is going to have to make concessions in order to get such bills through a Democratic-controlled Congress. News Analysis. [C1]    GLOBAL WARMING -- The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, put the blame for global warming on ''a frightening lack of leadership,'' saying the world's poorest people, who do not even create much pollution, bear the brunt of rising temperatures. Mr. Annan said he was not singling out the United States. [A18]    LESS FARMS, MORE FARMERS -- The number of family farms is dwindling but the National FFA Organization, once known as the Future Farmers of America, is growing. The group, which has almost half a million members, says more members now come from towns, suburbs and city neighborhoods, including Queens and the South Side of Chicago, than from rural farm regions. [A30]    NEW AOL CHIEF -- Time Warner switched chiefs at its AOL unit, naming Randy Falco, the No. 2 executive at the NBC Universal Television, chairman and chief executive. He replaces Jonathan F. Miller, who held the position since 2002. Mr. Falco, 52, made the move after it became clear that he was not in the running to succeed Bob Wright, who is 63, as NBC Universal's chairman and chief executive. [C3]    MERCK WINS AGAIN -- Merck won a sixth verdict in a case over its Vioxx painkiller when a federal jury ruled against a Utah man who claimed the drug caused his heart attack. Jurors in New Orleans rejected claims by Charles Mason, 64, who blamed Vioxx for his 2003 heart attack. Merck, which withdrew Vioxx in 2004, has won six cases over the drug and lost four. [C4]    ONLINE    Business Briefing    Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.    THE CAREER EDUCATION Corporation said it would sell 13 schools, including its nine-campus Gibbs division, to shed unprofitable operations and focus more on its culinary, medical, computer-training and fashion schools. McIntosh College, two campuses belonging to Brooks College, and Lehigh Valley College also will be sold, the company, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)    VOLKSWAGEN's former personnel director, Peter Hartz, was charged by prosecutors with 44 counts of breach of trust in connection with a corruption scandal involving the company's labor council. Mr. Hartz, 65, who was also responsible for helping overhaul Germany's labor market when Gerhard Schröder was chancellor, has largely confessed to the crime, said Joachim Geyer, a spokesman for prosecutors in Braunschweig.

Those representatives, in turn, are encouraged to recruit others and are promised that they will receive a portion of new enlistees' profits. The companies profit, at least in part, by collecting increased revenue and fees paid by new sales representatives. In April, citing hundreds of fraud investigations, the Federal Trade Commission proposed new rules for multilevel marketing companies and related businesses. [Page C1.]    SHORTCUT TO FASHION -- For fashionistas in lower tax brackets, reproducing the latest hip look from Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton can mean endless clicking through online retail sites and hit-or-miss searches on Google or shopping engines like Shopping.com. Now a new search site, Like.com, offers a shortcut for the budget-minded. The site and its chief executive, Munjal Shah, left, rely on artificial-intelligence technology to search images on the Web, and serve up goods for sale that visually match items on a shopper's wish list. E-Commerce Report, Bob Tedeschi. [C4.]    LIFE IN THE STUDIO -- In an era when producers, directors and popular actors are required to toe a stricter line, even Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is feeling the squeeze. His contribution to Disney cannot be underestimated. He has produced 17 films for the studio since 1991. They have brought in $5 billion. As part of a shift under Robert A. Iger, the new Disney chief executive, the studio pledged to make fewer films and focus on family-friendly movies that are marketable across all the company's businesses. That means Mr. Bruckheimer is now in the onscreen amusement park business. [C1.]    MOVING ON AFTER XBOX -- The hoopla was still swelling around November's debut of the Xbox 360, when some on its development team began conceiving a new product. Tomorrow, after committing hundreds of millions of dollars, Microsoft is scheduled to release the result of that research: the Zune. At a glance, it looks like yet another aspiring iPod rival. But the Zune can do something that no other player can claim: it can locate other Zune players and wirelessly exchange content with a few touches of a big shiny button. [C1.]    MUSIC FILLS THE AIR -- The upscale department store Nordstrom, which has taken a chance on up-and-coming designers, is now betting on a different set of rising stars: musicians. Beginning this holiday season, the retailer will develop and sell a collection of CDs that, over time, is expected to rival the one carried by Starbucks, its corporate neighbor in Seattle. [C11.]    TAKING A NEW PATH -- Two big advertisers known for following traditional ways of marketing products are expanding their efforts to become a little less conventional. Both, coincidentally, share the same creative and media agencies, which are also trying to demonstrate their eagerness to explore the brave world of new media. The advertisers are the General Electric Company and the Pepsi-Cola North America unit of PepsiCo. The agencies are both part of the Omnicom Group: BBDO Worldwide in New York for the creative parts of the campaigns and OMD for the media elements. Everyone on Madison Avenue ''is looking to push the envelope, find what is going to be the next big thing,'' said Jennifer Gordineer, group director for national investment on the PepsiCo account at OMD. Advertising, Stuart Elliott. [C8.]    GETTING A SECOND CHANCE -- Even adults, it seems, are getting a little sick of their childhoods, long after everyone else has. So TV Land, the network best-known for reruns of ''The Andy Griffith Show,'' is unveiling programming to appeal to what the network sees as one of the next obsessions for baby boomers: optimism about having second careers and changing lifestyles. Having recently produced reality shows with Farrah Fawcett and Mr. T, the network, which is owned by Viacom, is now turning its cameras on George Foreman, the former heavyweight boxing champion-turned-grill purveyor.

She ruled earlier that the federal government broke a promise to take waste from PG&E nuclear plants in California to the Yucca Mountain site, entitling the company to compensation. Utilities across the country have filed billions of dollars of claims against the government, seeking to recover costs incurred by storing spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste on site amid delays to the Yucca Mountain project.

TOP STORIES    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA    RUSSIA'S GREEN ECONOMICS: Russia's federal environmental protection agency, Rosprirodnadzor, has interfered in the country's economic affairs with increasing frequency, and may become the government's new tool for economic politics, the newspaper said. Just over a month after the agency charged foreign companies invested in the Sakhalin-2 energy project with ecological violations, the agency's head announced on Friday that the Russian oil company, Lukoil, may be stripped of its license to develop 19 oil deposits in Komi for breaking environmental regulations. The newspaper compared Russia's new ''green'' laws to its tax code, which the government sometimes uses for political purposes.    KOMMERSANT    RESTRICTIONS ON ''STRATEGIC'' INVESTMENT: Russia's Ministry of Industry and Energy last week sent draft legislation to the government, which, if passed, would restrict foreign investment in strategic enterprises. The Federal Security Service proposed a stricter version of the law in 2005 after President Vladimir V. Putin commissioned the project. Under the latest draft, foreign companies could buy up to 50 percent of the shares in natural-resource monopolies and companies dealing in aircraft manufacturing, atomic energy, Russia's military-industrial complex, and federal resource deposits.    TESTIMONY LEADS TO MORE QUESTIONS IN KOZLOV MURDER: Despite the cooperation of three suspects charged with the murder of Andrei Kozlov, the deputy head of the Central Bank, the identity their employer and his intermediary remain unknown. According to information by the three Ukrainians arrested last week, they were unaware of plans to kill Mr. Kozlov, having been assigned simply to follow him. An unknown person, they told investigators, gave two of them weapons and ordered them to murder Mr. Kozlov minutes before they committed the crime. The suspects said the order was completely unexpected.    YOUTH, POLICE CLASH OVER GEORGIA: Activists from the opposition youth group, ''Stop the Hysteria'' held a protest on Sunday opposite the Interior Affairs Ministry in Moscow against the ''fascist methods'' employed by the government against Georgians in Russia. Police officers on the scene beat and detained two members of the pro-Kremlin youth organization, Young Russia, who tried to hold a counter protest.    IZVESTIA    GEORGIAN PRESIDENT FUMING AFTER RESOLUTION: The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution forbidding the presence of Georgian military forces in the upper Kodori Gorge and strengthening the mandate of Russian peacekeepers in the conflict zone between Georgia and Abkhazia. In response to the resolution, Georgia's president, Mikhail Saakashvili, practically admitted to Georgia's preparations for war with Abkhazia, the newspaper wrote.

CRITICAL ON CHECHNYA: A Nizhny Novgorod region court on Friday closed one of the last sources of independent information on Chechnya, a year and a half after its director was sentenced to two years in prison for publishing personal appeals by Chechen rebel leaders, Aslan A. Maskhadov and Akhmed Zakaev. Prosecutors accused the nongovernmental organization, the Society of Russian-Chechen Friendship, of tax violations, extremism and illegal use of the word ''Russian'' among other charges.

VEDOMOSTI    RUSSIA'S INERT COMMUNIST PARTY: The electoral success of Russia's new leftist alliance -- uniting the Pensioner's Party, Party of Life and the Motherland party -- has endangered the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.

According to one expert, the party is chained by ideology to its electorate and cannot easily enlarge its voter base.    ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA    MILITARY TO FOCUS ON YOUTH POLITICS: Russia's deputy defense minister announced on Sunday the ministry's intention to become more involved in the lives of Russia's youth. The ministry recently signed an order that will revive World War II-era youth military institutes nicknamed the ''regiment's sons.'' Russia's military command may also decide to extend, from three to seven years, the term of study in Russian military academies. The minister said that while Russian youth are fully capable of becoming Russian soldiers, the lack of defined youth politics condemns the country to an uncertain future.  "
