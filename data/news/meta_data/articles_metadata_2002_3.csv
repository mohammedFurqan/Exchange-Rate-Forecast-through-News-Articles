Q. I want to take you back one year ago; we want try to get your thoughts about Sept. 11 in Mexico. A little more than a year ago you were in Washington and you challenged the U.S. to adopt new immigration laws, and doing so you also challenged the U.S. to look at Mexico as more than a poor neighbor; as an equal partner. Some analysts in Mexico have said that after the United States and Afghanistan, Mexico has been the country most affected economically and politically by Sept. 11. How do you see the scope of the impact? A. The first thing, I would confirm that, yes, there was an unprecedented effect on Sept 11. It was unexpected, surprising but at the same time of the highest impact. This impact was felt in the United States, in Mexico and in the whole world. It was a shock for the whole world. And in Mexico's case it hit us at a summit in our relationship. At that moment we were in Congress, where we had won favorable reaction to our proposals. We were at the closest possible point to an agreement with the government of President Bush both on immigration and on a deepening of integration under NAFTA. That is why for us the impact is stronger; to go from the summit of optimism, of positive results, to the unprecedented shock of the terrorist attack. And this effectively forced the United States to concentrate its attention on the issue of security. By dedicating so much concentration to the issue of security, bilateral matters pass to a secondary level. Those matters continue to have enormous importance to us. I ask myself if it is necessary to choose between the two issues. I believe that work can be done on security, in combating terrorism in Mexico we have done our part in this area. But at the same time, the world must continue working. The world must continue advancing, and even more our bilateral relations with the United States. So beginning from Sept. 11, we did introduce in our agenda the issue of security and commitment to fighting terrorism. It's a commitment that we not only made to the U.S. government but also particularly with United Nations Resolution 1373. But at the same time we're working on putting our bilateral agenda back into discussion and the truth is that we haven't managed to reach the levels we had before Sept. 11. So what are we doing? As a consequence we are working on issues that have to do with migration but they are only partial [steps] such as issuing the identification card, the consular identification card, as a security measure in that it fully identifies our compatriots. On the other hand, it also advances the recognition of the rights of illegal immigrants who work in the U.S., who work with U.S. companies, who work with U.S. families, who work with U.S. citizens, and who merit the greatest respect and the greatest acknowledgment for what they do. Q. After Sept. 11, political costs of your support for the United States began to mount. People began to criticize you as having a subservient attitude toward the United States, that you were giving so much and getting nothing in return. You canceled trips to the United States. Congress denied permission for you to travel there. There have been disputes with the United States over the death penalty, water, trade. How do you feel? A: My first clear and resounding answer is that the relationship continues, just as strong, just as friendly. Our partnership is increasingly more committed to the U.S., our partnership for prosperity _ the document signed in Monterrey (inaudible). Regarding your comment, we would have to separate the response into various baskets. One: the reasons for which I did not go on two trips to the United States. The first because effectively the Congress denied me permission to leave. And on this matter I take the opportunity to comment that in Mexico, I find contradicting reactions in regards to relations with the United States. On one side, citizens have great respect for the United States, they have a great feeling of friendship. That is solid. But in the opposition and in the political arena I often find criticism of the closeness of relations with the United States. That is a reality. And it is a reality that flares up every time a new issue arises. And the issue comes up every day. The death penalty, the execution of Javier [Suarez Medina], the Mexican citizen executed in Texas, for us the defense of human rights is a very important issue. It's a priority and we express it each time that a situation that has to do with human rights comes up as in the case of this execution. We had to let the governor of Texas know that we do not share support the death penalty. At the same time we had to let the justice system of Texas know that some elemental rights of this Mexican were violated, as in not having advised the Mexican Consulate of his arrest and of the charges against him. This is a commitment that both Mexico and the U.S. have signed in the Convention of Vienna and which requires us to advise the consulate when this situation arises. And thirdly, well, I could not make a visit to Texas eight days after this Mexican was executed. I let the governor of Texas know. I asked for clemency or that Javier's sentence be changed. I asked that the execution be postponed so that documents could be presented showing the violation of Javier's rights. I asked that the time-frame be extended to make the visit and I did not receive a response. So I saw myself obligated to cancel the trip. As far as the dispute over water is concerned, I think that it was on very good terms. It's an issue where a resolution was pending. The conditions of the Rio Grande River Basin have changed. The level of rainfall that we receive each year has changed and so we have to change the the responses we give. Fortunately, as always happens, we found the response through dialogue with United States authorities and now the the issue of the Rio Grande River Basin is resolved for the next five years. Conflicts like this are constantly arising, problems that we deal with and resolve in a relationship as intense as the one between Mexico and the U.S.. Q. But are you frustrated that your efforts to embark on a new relationship with the United States has not been reciprocated? A. There are feelings on my part that I would not describe as frustration or resentment. But I feel strongly that we need to deal with bilateral issues. I constantly make it known to the American government that we need the same kind of attention for Latin America. Things aren't going well in Latin America and we have to work very hard so that things improve in Latin America. The U.S., Canada and Mexico right now enjoy better conditions of stability and economic development and so we are the most obligated to pay attention to Latin America. In the case of the U.S. and Canada, they should pay attention to Mexico. So, without it being a complaint, without it being a product of frustration, I do constantly call on the administration of President Bush to dedicate more time to bilateral and Latin America issues. Q. Your foreign minister said in an interview recently that Mexico would embark on a new strategy to get the immigration back on the U.S. agenda. Talk to me about that. A. It isn't anything spectacular or terribly innovative. We simply realize that at this moment while the U.S. elections process is going on it won't be possible to raise the migration agenda. In the same way it wasn't possible immediately after Sept. 11. So we are waiting for an important window of opportunity after the U.S. elections. I think that it is the right time to push this theme strongly. And there we would expect reciprocity. We would expect fulfillment of goals. President Bush himself expressed that he would really be an ally in the cause of migration, that we would work together to return the issue to the highest priority, [that we would] work with U.S. legislators as well so that they would look favorably upon this development. This window of opportunity next year [will occur] because the U.S. economy will surely begin growing again and it will require more and more workers [to fill] more and more jobs. So the strategy is to take advantage of this window of opportunity. We will have a very active migration policy next year. Q. Will you work directly with (political) parties and Congress? A. With everybody, legislators, local levels where there is a strong Mexican presence, where the presence of Mexicans is appreciated and valued such as Texas, California, Chicago, and in other parts of the U.S. At the local government level, with the governors, with the state congresses we will have a very active policy on this issue so that hopefully we can fulfill our intention of reaching a result by the end of 2003. Q. Will those plans be successful if there is an attack on Iraq? A. The consequences of an attack on Iraq are not predictable. It appears to me that it would have very broad effects at the global level on many things and it would have very broad effects on bilateral issues and issues on the Latin American agenda. I believe that the issue of Iraq must be the product of deep reflection. It seems to us that this is a matter that should be channeled through the United Nations Security Council; that there should be an opportunity for a visit by United Nations inspectors to Iraq. We, as a country, will be pushing strongly in that direction; in that it will be the U.N. that makes the visit, that it's the U.N. which certifies what conditions are there. But first [we need] objective information to be able to then reflect on the best decisions to take. I think the Iraq situation would have an impact that would affect the whole world. Q. Would you support President Bush? Last night on Televisia, a poll showed that 70 percent of Mexicans are opposed to an attack against Iraq. How does your government feel. A. At this moment we can't take a position, nor make a decision precisely because information is lacking. It would be very important to really know what are Iraq's activities regarding terrorism, what are Iraq's activities regarding weapons of mass destruction, what are its activities in terms of its ability to deliver these weapons. The debate which must take place in the United Nations and in the U.N. Security Council, where we are present, is also important. So for me and for Mexico first we need a lot of information, a lot of objectivity, deep reflection and then we will be able to give an opinion. Q. Last question., you call yourself the president the 123 million Mexicans, including 23 million who live in the United States. Since Sept. 11 deportations have increased, arrests on the border have declined but the number of Mexicans dying on the border has not. How have Mexicans in the United States been affected by Sept. 11. Are their rights in danger? A. Well, as long as we do not reach a solution on immigration, which is the intention, these painful circumstances will occur. We are trying to avoid these painful deaths. We're there on the border, we're in the mountains, we're there with the army. We're there with our border agents dedicated to migration issues. We're working intensely to try to stop these deaths from happening. In the same way, we continue to be very committed to Mexicans in the U.S. We have managed to get the consular identification card accepted throughout the U.S. banking and financial system. With this, migrants can now open checking accounts. We have managed to get this accepted as a full identification card by city, country and state authorities. We have managed to get the card accepted so that Mexicans, even if they are in the United States illegally, can apply for driver's licenses in various cities and counties. We have managed to remove discrimination against them regarding their entry into state universities. In sum, we are working through the consulates to be close to our compatriots and to help them as much as possible. But in the end the best solution is a migration accord."

Buffett is close to a deal to invest as much as $500 million in the Williams Companies, the energy concern, executives close to the talks said. The move would be his second major investment in the debt-ridden energy sector this week and would help keep Williams from filing for bankruptcy protection.    The transaction would give Mr. Buffett's MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, preferred stock in Williams that would be secured by pipeline assets. Mr. Buffett appears to be nearly alone in his effort to buy energy assets, trying to take advantage of the decimated stock and debt-filled balance sheets of energy companies. [Page C5.]    G.E.

[C12.]    Deutsche Bank Defends Chief  Deutsche Bank has defended its chief executive, Josef Ackermann, from accusations that he and other directors of Mannesmann acted improperly in awarding about $70 million to managers during its takeover battle with the Vodafone Group. [World Business, Section W.]    Financier Sells Investment Firms  Martin Ebner, left, the financier who spent the 1990's shaking up Switzerland's clubby corporations and coaxing the Swiss to invest in stocks, has sold the controlling stake in four investment companies, with portfolios worth $2 billion, to the Zurich Cantonal Bank, a regional bank. [World Business, Section W.]    Charges Seen in WorldCom Case  Federal prosecutors are expected to file charges today against former executives of WorldCom, accusing them of engaging in a fraud that led the company to misstate its expenses by almost $4 billion.
