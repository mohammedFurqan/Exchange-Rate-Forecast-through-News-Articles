I'm interested in leaving money to make sure that my two dogs and cats are well cared for after I'm gone. What's the best way to accomplish this? A few people have found this to be a silly idea, but I'm serious. KATHY LEFAUVE Snyder, N.Y. A. Upon his death in 1880, Jonathan Jackson of Ohio left directions that his money be used to build a kind of Yale Club for cats -- a posh residence and drop-in center where strays could grab a meal, crash for the night, gossip with their cronies or listen to accordion concerts in a small auditorium. ""It is man's duty, as lord of animals, to watch over and protect the lesser and feebler,"" he wrote.  You can bet Mr. Jackson's biped survivors were not amused by his quirky bequest. But if you own a dog or cat -- or any other type of pet, from a Rottweiler to a pygmy vole -- there is nothing silly about making formal arrangements for its care should you die first. ""You wouldn't think of going on vacation without arranging for your animals to be fed and cared for,"" says Reynaldo Samala, executive director of the New York office of Bide-a-Wee Home Association. ""Shouldn't you make similar preparations for when you're gone permanently?""  At the very least, this means providing the animal with a home, a competent and caring owner, basic amenities like food and medical care, and a life style similar to what it now has. ""All these arrangements can be written into your will,"" says John O. McManus, a New York lawyer specializing in estate planning. If you're so disposed, he adds, you may want to consider burial arrangements.  Most pet owners never get around to making such provisions, largely for the same reason they neglect to write wills in the first place -- ""because they don't really expect to die,"" says Mary Lehman, a Bankers Trust managing director and former head of its trusts and estate department. Not surprisingly, those who do write their pets into their wills tend to be elderly owners, for whom a dog or cat may be a sole companion.  Regardless of one's age, it's prudent to make final arrangements. After all, we're all mortal, and an unforeseen accident -- is there another kind? -- can suddenly remove a young pet owner from the picture. (Certain species come with an all-but-ironclad guarantee of outliving their owners. A couple I know in their 40's own a Chilean land tortoise that they fully expect to usher in the 22d century.)  The first step is to choose a new owner -- ideally a trusted friend or relative who knows the animal and its idiosyncrasies and is willing and able to accommodate them. An 85-pound Irish Setter that spends its days romping outdoors clearly won't adjust well to life in a studio apartment; a shedding angora cat isn't an ideal companion for a neat freak.  Mismatches can be stressful to both animals and humans, and if things get really hairy, the new owner may wind up giving the animal to someone you would find unacceptable. Of course, it's a good idea to consult with the person you wish to designate as owner and caretaker. ""Imagine someone phoning you to say, 'Congratulations -- your Aunt Sally has died and left you her 12-year-old crippled Great Dane to care for,' "" says Ms. Lehman. ""Sounds crazy, but it happens more than you'd think.""  Because the cost of pet food, veterinary care and other necessaries can add up, you may want to earmark some money for those purposes. The easiest way -- if not necessarily the smartest -- is to bequeath the funds to the new owner. The problem is that there is no legal mechanism to guarantee that the money won't be spent on golf clubs or aluminum siding instead of kibble.  To discourage financial abuses, you can have a lawyer set up a trust, administered by a bank that dispenses the funds and that certifies their intended use. While a trust adds a layer of protection, ""it makes sense only when there is a substantial bequest, since it involves considerable legal and accounting fees and yearly tax returns,"" Ms. Lehman says. ""It wouldn't make sense to set up a trust for $5,000.""  Trusts are not absolutely tamper proof, either. In their book, ""Beyond the Grave"" (Harper Business, 1995, $23), the lawyers Gerald M. and Jeffrey L. Condon tell of an elderly client named Mrs. Green who left instructions that her black Labrador, Chauncy, continue to live at home after her death. In exchange for free rent and a monthly stipend of $1,000 from the ""Chauncy Trust,"" a neighbor named Mr. McSorley moved into the house and saw to the pooch's needs. The deal was to last as long as Chauncy lived.  Twice a year, a bank trust officer checked on Mr. McSorley to verify all was well. The officer eventually left the bank, and a successor took over his duties. Later, the successor too was replaced. During 12 years, ""six different trust officers were assigned to the Chauncy Trust,"" the authors write, ""all of them paying Mr. McSorley's salary, and all of them checking up on Chauncy's health.""   Chauncy was nine when Mrs. Green died, meaning he would have reached the hoary age of 21 in Mr. McSorley's care. In fact, he died at 14. Mr. McSorley promptly replaced him with a look-alike black Lab, also named Chauncy. When Chauncy 2d died, Mr. McSorley simply bought another. ""Whenever a new trust officer dropped by,"" the Condons write, ""Chauncy was there, and Mr. McSorley still got his salary -- and a free place to live.""  If you can't think of anyone to entrust with your pet, many charities and shelters will take dogs and cats and place them in good homes in exchange for a donation or a bequest. Before you sign anything, make sure you visit their premises and understand exactly how they operate. ""You do not want a charity that will dump your pet on the first willing person it finds,"" say the Condons. Nor do you want your pet to live out its remaining years in a wire cage.  As a rule, leaving money directly to a pet in your will is not wise. It makes for a will that can be easily challenged and broken.  Not every will is reduced to tatters by furious heirs, though. One of my favorites in the annals of pet lore is the tale of Tommie, a 28-pound house cat who inherited $200,000, an opulent home and the services of a full-time housekeeper upon the death of his mistress, Mrs. Andree P. Monst of North Carolina, in 1965. No need to fear, sudden wealth didn't change Tommie, described as a mean cat long before its inheritance came through. ""I tried to pet it, and it bit me,"" a neighbor said of Tommie. ""I was just trying to be friendly.""

""We're on the right track,"" President Clinton declared, trying to take advantage of the sunny report for his budget negotiations with the Congress.  [ Page 1. ] Stock prices rebounded after Thursday's selloff as money managers took heart that inflation appeared to be under control. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 37.93 points, to 4,741.75. Bank stocks and technology issues were strong.  [ 37. ] Bond prices swung widely as traders first feared that the strong economy would keep the Fed from lowering interest rates further, then tempered their reaction, seeing hope for a budget accord. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.35.  [ 36. ] Allied Signal to Cut 3,100 Jobs  Allied Signal reported a 15 percent rise in third-quarter net income but said profit in its automotive parts unit was off.

The promised waiting time at this fancy new garage: 2.5 minutes PUBLISHING  Those Business Week Papers Let's see. First Procter & Gamble sued Bankers Trust, saying it had been led down a too-risky investment path. A mass of papers quickly piled up -- lawyers tend to be good at that -- and a judge decided some of them weren't quite ready for public consumption. Then Business Week got hold of the sealed papers and smelled a scoop, a judge said no, and all sorts of First Amendment hell broke loose. Last week some smoke cleared, as the judge unsealed the documents, which seemed to bolster P.&G.'s case by disclosing losses at other companies from derivatives sold by Bankers Trust. But the free-speech issue was left smoldering, for the judge also insisted he had the right to stop publication. Now it's in the lap of the appeals courts.  CHARITY  Throwing Big Money at Cancer  It's all too familiar these days: a takeover, a merger, a little board-room back-scratching, and some executive walks away with a sum that would boggle the mind even if it lost a couple of zeroes. But last week came a stunning variation: the mind-numbing sum was going not to an executive but to science. Jon Huntsman, who made about $1 billion in chemicals, lost both parents to cancer and battled it twice himself. That was enough to prod him to say he'd give $100 million to a cancer research center at the University of Utah. That may be walking-around money to Ted Turner, but it's the largest individual gift ever to medical research. ""It's been 26 years since a man walked on the moon,"" Mr. Huntsman said, and we're still battling cancer. He wants to win this one. AUTOS  Speaking Out at Chrysler  The seat belts are off at Chrysler. Last week the chairman, Robert Eaton, lashed out at those he said wanted to ""trash"" the company -- mainly Kirk Kerkorian and Jerome York. He said Mr. Kerkorian, who now owns nearly 15 percent of Chrysler, ""has no real knowledge"" about what's happening and is merely out for ""personal gain."" He said Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. York -- the former Chrysler executive who's now in Mr. Kerkorian's camp -- are merely harming other shareholders by trying to gain control.    REAL ESTATE  Japanese for 'Low Rent'  Japanese real estate prices are so high they're almost an international joke (so long as someone else is paying them). So when you hear that they've plummeted -- by two-thirds or more -- in recent years, does that mean they're out of the stratosphere? Not exactly. You'll still spend $6,000 or so (every month!) to rent a modest suburban house, perhaps $4,000 for a one-bedroom Tokyo apartment; this is Japanese for ""plummet."" And it may not even last. Last week the I.M.F. forecast a recovery for the battered Japanese economy in 1996, though it did lower its estimate for the nation's growth this year. Rent 'em while you can.

So you'd think that Jay Bonin, who's in the top 200 or so Americans in his chosen field, would be riding high. If he'd been a lawyer, he might have been one of the hundreds of that profession at the Simpson defense table; if he played baseball, he'd be out there spitting with the richest of them. But Mr. Bonin's great talent is chess. Yes, there's $1 million in prize money in the world championship match that was speeding toward a conclusion last week atop the World Trade Center, but in chess, if you're not at that pinnacle, you'd better have a day job. Mr. Bonin, brilliant at chess, makes a few thousand a year at it; by day, he's a mailroom clerk. INNOVATIONS  Making Cats Easier to Love  There are, those tireless statisticians tell us, 63 million cats in this country. There'd be a lot fewer if it weren't for one Edward Lowe. Cats, you see, smell. Built for the desert, they use water with enviable efficiency, but the downside is that their urine . . . well, you know. To fight the odor, people tried sawdust, sand, wood shavings, but they weren't much help. Then one day in 1947 -- a watershed day in feline history -- Mr. Lowe had a neighbor try a dried, granulated clay used to sop up grease spills in factories. And, yes, Kitty Litter was born -- along with what is now a $600 million annual industry. And Mr. Lowe? In 1990 he sold his business for $200 million. And last week he died at age 75. OPPORTUNITIES  Gulps of Premium Juice  Who has the most impact on this marvelous capitalist machine we inhabit? Well, one week it might be Bill Gates, the next week Newt Gingrich, and the next, Steven Spielberg. Last week, of course, it was 12 faceless jurors in a Los Angeles courtroom. They spoke, and this mighty economy -- which prides itself on packing every second chock full -- ground to a halt for long, long minutes. You could have heard a stock drop, if any had been trading; you could have heard the phone ring, if anyone had called. The jurors spoke, and whole conglomerates were born -- reported $1 million sales of photos of the reunion of the defendant (what was his name?) and his children, tales of $50 million pay-per-view blowout interviews, other interview deals, book deals, and then probably books about the book deals. And, yes, talk of a television drama series based on the lives of two DNA experts. And it's only just begun.  HEALTH CARE  Medicare Plan Under Fire  Medicare may well need patching up, but the Republicans' notions about how to do it took a lot of flak last week. First came the American Medical Association, which has kept silent for much of the recent debate but now voiced concern that limits on payments would scare too many doctors away. ""It would be a major blow,"" said an A.M.A. spokesman. Then the A.A.R.P. joined the fray, saying Congress was cutting ""too much, too fast"" from projected spending. Newt Gingrich has been trying to get the elderly on his side, but he doesn't seem to have succeeded. And in a final attack, the head of the American College of Physicians said bluntly, ""We are not on board."""

Anderson, the former  chief executive of ARCO, had run out of luck in founding the Hondo Oil and Gas Company instead of kicking back on his New Mexico ranch to enjoy his retirement.

Creditors and short-sellers were closing in.         But in the last few months, almost everything has gone right for Hondo. A second well has indicated that the project is probably sitting on 9 to 12 trillion cubic feet of gas, about twice the earlier estimates, analysts said. That amount of gas would be valued at billions of dollars, even before counting  petroleum liquids that might be worth almost as much.   "
