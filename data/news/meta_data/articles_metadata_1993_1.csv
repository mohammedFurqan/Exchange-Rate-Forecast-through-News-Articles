America's relations with China for years to come may be determined by Mr. Clinton's handling of a single issue in the next six months: extension of ""most-favored-nation"" trading status for China.   Mr. Clinton suggested in the campaign that he wanted to add human rights conditions to any extension of this status, which guarantees the low tariffs that are applied to virtually all of the United States' trading partners. If Mr. Clinton decides to impose tough conditions that Beijing feels it cannot meet, relations could deteriorate precipitously."

The research center was viewed as such a model of how an American company should operate in Japan that President George Bush planned to make a speech there on his trip to Japan last year, only to cancel when he fell ill at a state dinner.   But now, in a move directed by Kodak headquarters in Rochester, the company is sharply cutting back its research activities in Japan. The Yokohama laboratory is seeking voluntary resignations from 70 of the 110 researchers. And, in a move that is virtually unheard of in Japan, Kodak has told eight college students it agreed to hire that it will not have jobs for them."

Yet Hunter has made real progress toward obtaining the Holy Grail of the hazardous waste industry -- state and Federal approval for a disposal site."

But to many economists, including many liberal ones, the minimum wage is one can of worms they would just as soon not crack.

Or maybe not, but as the last racially exclusive Parliament gathers in the southern-hemisphere summer of Cape Town, it is easy to understand the impulse of the white rulers to prolong their stay in power, if only for one more season of cold lobster and Cape wines, of the dolphins leaping in Camps Bay and the clouds tumbling down Table Mountain and the cream tea at the Mount Nelson Hotel."

This stems from the completion of the Trident missile systems project and expectations of other Pentagon decisions, a statement said. Roberta Silverstein, a spokeswoman, said about two-thirds of the jobs at the military and aerospace division -- 200 of roughly 300 -- would be eliminated. The remaining cuts will come from units that support the division."

Yeltsin of Russia arrived in Budapest for a state visit with a crate full of gifts meant to soothe lingering aches in Hungary, a onetime satellite of the Soviet Union.    Hungarians had little reason to love the Russians, who crushed the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and had helped the Austrians put down a republican revolt in 1848. Several generations of Communist-era Hungarian students proudly completed a decade of compulsory Russian language training without being able to utter much more than ""Russians go home."""

But many economists say the biggest problem about the President's package is not that it will speed up growth dangerously, creating fears of inflation, but that it will slow growth too much."

The launching seems likely to be the latest success for Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, a little known agency that operates on a shoestring but, to the envy of some Americans, has managed to launch 15 scientific satellites in two decades."

The reason is that it operates in conjunction with a global satellite system that uses the 406.025 megahertz frequency designated for distress signals, and the Federal Communications Commission has not approved use of the signal over land for fear of saturating the frequency."

Many securities analysts are forecasting lower 1993 earnings for the public brokerage and investment banking firms.   While last year's final totals are not in yet, member firms of the New York Stock Exchange that deal with the public probably reached highs in pretax profits, with estimates ranging to as much as a total $7 billion. That compares with $5.9 billion the previous year. For 1992's first nine months alone, pretax profits grew to $5 billion from $4 billion in the year-earlier period."

Landlocked and located in South America's heart, Paraguay seemed fated to once again become ""an island surrounded by land."""

Some of it is then sold to drug traffickers in Afghanistan. Smaller amounts reach Myanmar, formerly Burma, through India's eastern border."

It said the slowdown was caused by worldwide pressures on drug prices, growing competition and the strength of the dollar overseas. The company said it would eliminate 1,000 of its 38,400 jobs through dismissals and attrition.   Merck told analysts that it expected 1993 earnings to rise only 11 to 12 percent instead of the 14 to 16 percent the company had expected. A year ago, Merck had reported a 17.6 percent profit increase for the first quarter and even that rise was considered disappointing compared with the 19 percent increase in the similar 1991 quarter. Earnings for 1992 fell 6 percent, to almost $2 billion, after a series of accounting charges."

For all of what Bush Administration officials describe as their foreign policy successes elsewhere, the concede that they are leaving Mr. Clinton with an overarching problem in Asia: a Japan policy that is in disarray, with few fresh ideas about how to deal with America's biggest economic competitor.    The trade deficit, after declining temporarily, is almost at record levels -- nearly $50 billion in 1992. With Japan in the midst of one of its steepest economic declines in years, the chances for a boost in imports of American goods this year are virtually nil. And the Japanese fear a backlash that will lead to unilateral American action to restrict Japanese imports, poisoning early relations with the new Administration. Lurking beneath the surface is resentment at the failure of the Bush Administration to focus on Japanese concerns; as Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d spent more time visiting Ulan Bator than Tokyo."

But the drug industry must recognize that its own behavior is responsible for much of this scrutiny.   For 12 years, prescription drugs have been the fastest-inflating part of the fastest-inflating part of our economy: the health care system. Prescription costs represent the highest out-of-pocket medical expense for three out of four of our elderly. And millions of older Americans say they must make choices between buying food and drugs."

This summit meeting came and went with so little fanfare that many Russians, celebrating the beginning of a long winter holiday, were barely aware it had taken place."

Other countries are turning to Australia for help with their own conversions.   Actually, it took more than 20 years to bring out notes made of solid plastic and involved sophisticated technologies generally used in the production of advanced computer chips.  Why plastic? It is much smoother than paper, so bills can be printed with finer type -- letters only .25 millimeter high, about one-hundredth of an inch -- which is far too fine to be duplicated by copying machines. Plastic can also be made clear, another way to defeat color copiers. And it can incorporate other security features better than paper."

Facing stiff competition and disappearing profits, corporate America has been throwing workers overboard, by the millions. Last week alone, four corporate giants announced that nearly 100,000 jobs -- most of them ""good"" ones, meaning full-time work with health and pension benefits -- would soon disappear. The Clinton Administration is debating measures that might slow the process. But what is really needed, nearly everyone agrees, is a wholesale reorganization of the way Americans work.   The reorganization, emphasizing worker training, flexibility and initiative, is hardly new. Some American companies have been trying for years to make the transformation. But now, with the job cutbacks showing no sign of easing off, the need to change is becoming more urgent. The hope among many public policy experts and executives is that jobs will somehow be saved if companies constantly train and retrain their workers, so that even the lowliest stock clerks learn new tasks while carrying out their old ones in an entrepreneurial and hustling spirit."

They're next-door neighbors in lookalike towers in the World Financial Center. And Shearson, in the taller tower, is the only firm on Wall Street that comes close to powerhouse Merrill, both in selling securities through a network of branch offices and in corporate finance, the business of creating new securities to be sold. Still, the neighbors are different indeed. Merrill has molded itself into a model of a diversified, profitable securities firm; Shearson aspires to do the same, but has much to overcome. Merrill Lynch's growth has been largely internal, with no major acquisitions in the past 10 years; Shearson was a second-tier firm until it acquired Lehman Brothers, a leading trading and corporate finance firm, in 1984 and the troubled E. F. Hutton in 1988. Merrill Lynch has chalked up record profits; Shearson foundered, and its parent, American Express, rescued it in 1990 with a $750 million cash infusion. Now Shearson is rebuilding with an eye to becoming strong enough to stand alone. Shearson is expected to return to profitability this year, but whether the profits will be great enough to repair its damaged reputation is uncertain. At Shearson's Helm    The new faces in the executive suite at Shearson Lehman belong to two Lehman executives - J. Tomilson Hill, a 44-year-old investment banker, and Richard Fuld, a 46-year-old former trader. Although they lack experience in Shearson's brokerage business, they have the support of American Express's chairman, Harvey Golub. His mandate: Reduce costs and make Shearson profitable. At Merrill's Helm    Merrill's two top executives - William Schreyer, the 65-year-old chairman, and Daniel Tully, the 61-year-old president and C.E.O. - both rose through the branch office system. Mr. Schreyer, who will retire this year, was a key executive when Merrill expanded into government securities and corporate finance in the 1970's Mr. Tully, a sales specialist, has managed other parts of the business deftly in recent years. At Shearson, Round Two of Cost-Cutting; Profitable Merrill Stays The Course    Shearson Lehman, having lost $116 million in 1992, a year of record profits for other Wall Street firms, is on the verge of its second cost-cutting drive in three years, seeking to eliminate duplicate overhead costs at the Shearson and Lehman Brothers parts of the firm. No major line of business is to be abandoned. In contrast to 1990, when the broker network was slashed, Shearson will continue expanding its broker staff, in the hope it will produce higher revenues without significantly higher costs.    If Shearson Lehman matches other financial companies' 5 percent to 10 percent cut in fixed costs, the savings would come to $120 million to $240 million, moving it closer to its profit goal of $500 million. Profits will be greatly helped, analysts note, by the end of special charges for past mistakes, like the $245 million written off last year from an investment in Computervision.    Shearson Lehman executives are also looking for ways to reduce the cost of salaries and bonuses, perhaps by offering equity in the firm. At Merrill, where employees own about 25 percent of the company, stock acquired on favorable terms is an important part of total compensation.    Merrill Lynch, flush with two consecutive years of record profits, aims to stay the course. The cost control learned in the past few years put Merrill in good shape to weather the industry downturn that is sure to come eventually. Its brokerage force has been stable at just under 12,000, but it has been able to reduce the number of support workers in the last six years.    Merrill has mostly avoided major miscues in its trading and corporate finance departments. Its interest-rate and currency swaps business has emerged as a major profit center, making the compnay less dependent on commissions and corporate finance fees, both of which are high now, but could decline.    ""We want to be a sales-driven company that is a dominant force in every product line"" said Daniel Tully, president. ""Then we can be indifferent as to what the customer is buying, so long as they buy it from us."""

The sudden rise sent the price of the 30-year bond up 21/32 point and the yield down to 6.89 percent, from 6.94 percent on Friday. But traders said there was little to make of the price rise because it did not make up for the Friday selloff and was caused by technical trading and rumors about some possible Federal Reserve actions later in the week."

Sales were held back by a 2.2 percent drop in sales by automotive dealers, and there might have been no gain at all, analysts said, without price increases in building materials and some other items. The price of lumber soared 90 percent from early October to the end of February, reflecting increased demand brought on by the economic recovery and environmental battles that have sharply curtailed supplies from Federal lands. Apparent Contradiction    The 25,000 rise in jobless claims, to 376,000, was the third in a row and something of a surprise in light of last Friday's report of substantial job growth for February. That earlier report on employment conditions was conducted during the week ended Feb. 13."

AIRLINES   Not much change. Unrestricted competition will not be permitted among airlines throughout the community, until Jan. 1, 1997. Then, for example, British Air or Lufthansa will be able to compete with Air France on the Paris-Nice route. BANKS    A single banking license grants freedom of establishment anywhere in the community. But differences persist. For example, some communities have interest-bearing checking accounts, but France does not permit them. BEER    A single market has been formed after a concession from Germany, which had strict standards of purity dating from the 1500's. CARS    Citizens can buy cars anywhere, and all cars are now made to Eurostandards (although standardized white headlights are being introduced only this year, replacing the yellow in France). But value added tax rates remain different and manufacturers apply widely differing prices in different markets. CHEESE    After a huge row, the European Commission loosened its regulations, allowing France to sell its cheese made from non-pasteurized milk throughout the community. COMPANY STATUTES    It is not yet plausible to set up a community-wide company because of disagreement on what provisions the law should carry for the participation of workers in management. CUSTOMS    Goods move freely as of Jan 1, and an estimated 60 million customs documents and forms are to disappear. ENVIRONMENT    Common environmental standards have been set for industry throughout the comunnity but targets have not yet been reached. INSURANCE    Regulations on life insurance will not be harmonized until 1994. PASTA    Italians tried to bar imports of soft-wheat pasta from elsewhere in the community. The case went to the European Court of Justice where the Italians were told they would have to accept the mushy pasta. PRICES    They vary widely. Cameras, for example, cost 40 percent more in Portugal than in France. PUBLIC PROCUREMENT    Open bidding for contracts awarded by water, telecommunications, energy or transport utilities has been adopted. But in practice, analysts believe it will be hard to break through national barriers in these areas. SHOPPING    Limits have been abolished on what community citizens can buy in other community states. But people may be questioned if they are buying more than 800 cigarettes, 100 bottles of wine, 110 liters of beer or 10 liters of spirits. SOFTWARE   Copyright protection has been harmonized as of January 1. TAX   Harmonized European taxes are not around the corner. But value added tax levels are being gradually harmonized, with a minimum of 15 percent established. Germany is lowest, at 15 percent. Denmark highest at 25 percent. No agreement has been reached on whether to allow companies to offset tax liabilities in one member state with losses at subsidiaries in another. TELEPHONE    The market for data services is now open, but not the market for basic telephone services, a huge market that state-owned companies are reluctant to surrender. TV    No restrictions on broadcasting across borders."

The very best commercial banks, when they are acquired, sell for 2.5 times book value. Why then is Anchor Bancorp, which just a few years ago was on the brink of failure, selling for $14.50 a share, nearly three times its tangible book value of $4.98? This has perplexed the savings bank's chief executive, James M. Large Jr., who has seen the stock run up from less than $1 two years ago.    The answer is that investors are looking at Anchor's earnings rather than book value. Anchor earned $1.85 a share in the last four quarters for a price-earnings multiple of 7.8, which is about average for healthy savings institutions. And investors have become confident that the bank, under Mr. Large, has put its problems behind it so that the earnings will continue to grow."

Yet a prominent spirits marketer will soon take that tack in a campaign for one of its leading brands.   Print advertisements scheduled for later this month for Southern Comfort, the bourbon liqueur from the Brown-Forman Beverage Company, will carry the theme ""Take it easy."" The campaign, the first since Altschiller Reitzfeld in New York was named the agency for the estimated $10 million account for Brown-Forman brands, incorporates the moderation message in an overall appeal for drinkers to remember, as one ad puts it: ""Life is not work. It can't be. It better not be."""

By 2000, half the work force will be women, mostly of childbearing age. And four out of five women in the work force will probably have children during their working lives.    So managers may want to pull up their socks and read a second chapter in ""Parental Leave and Productivity,"" a study released recently by the Families and Work Institute in New York. Like the institute's research on supervisors' attitudes toward leave reported on here last week, ""The True Cost of Parental Leave"" may offer some surprises to anyone who thinks family leaves are terminally disruptive and expensive.

Robinson 3d as chairman and promoting Harvey Golub to chief executive said yesterday that they were resigning.   Rawleigh Warner Jr., 71, the retired chairman and chief executive of the Mobil Corporation and an American Express director for more than 20 years, told the board after its meeting on Monday of his intentions and submitted a letter yesterday saying that he would step down immediately, two months before he had planned to retire. He said he no longer felt it was appropriate to remain a director after he had opposed the company's top managers. 'Thoughtful Consideration'    Joseph H. Williams, a director since 1981, told the company that he would not stand for re-election in April and that he would resign immediately as a member of the compensation committee. Mr. William, 58, said in a statement that ""after thoughtful consideration"" and ""the very strong dissent I registered"" he felt it would have been inappropriate to remain on the board. Mr. Williams is chairman and chief executive of the Williams Companies.   John J. Byrne, 61, the chairman and chief executive of the Fund American Companies, confirmed in an interview that he had told the board in mid-November, two months after the search had begun, that he would not stand for re-election in April. He cited personal reasons for his resignation that had nothing to do with the board's decision to keep Mr. Robinson in place and elevate Mr. Golub.   The three men had voted with the minority when Mr. Robinson and Mr. Golub won their new positions in a 15-to-4 board vote Monday. The 57-year-old Mr. Robinson had been chairman and chief executive since 1977; Mr. Golub, 53, had been the company president since 1991. The board considered their appointments as one ticket after a search committee, with Mr. Robinson as co-chairman, failed in four months to produce an alternative candidate to Mr. Golub to succeed Mr. Robinson as chief executive.   Mr. Warner stressed that he was stepping down of his own volition: ""It was entirely me. There was no effort to push me off.""   But he acknowledged that the ascension of Mr. Robinson and Mr. Golub had hastened his departure, with the company's mandatory retirement age at 72. Had an alternative to the Robinson-Golub ticket been presented to the board, he added, he would have served out his term.   ""It was a very simple decision,"" he said in an interview. ""I started the process of urging the board to replace Jimmy. The board did not see fit to agree with that position. So I didn't feel right having been so out of line with the rest of the board to stay on. It wouldn't have been good for me, for Jimmy, for Harvey or for the board. I would have been embarrassed to sit there as if I hadn't started anything.""   Mr. Warner denied he felt any sadness or disappointment with his decision, calling himself ""a pragmatist."" Before last year, he said, he was serving on six boards. By April, when he intends to leave the Caterpillar Inc. board, he will have resigned from them all.   Mr. Byrne, an American Express director since 1991, cited ""personal reasons"" for his pending departure. He elaborated only to the extent that he said his own business affairs needed more attention. He declined to entertain any questions about the succession or Monday's election results.   ""This had to do with the fact that my own affairs needed attention,"" he said in a telephone interview from his office in Norwich, Vt., adding: ""I am not a good outside director. I am used to managing things and not good when I am not. It was not a terrific fit for me and not a terrific fit for the board.'   Mr. Byrne's company is a financial holding company, built upon what had been the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company.   With the departures of Mr. Warner, Mr. Williams and Mr. Byrne, the American Express board is left with just one director who voted against the Robinson-Golub team. However, it is not clear who the fourth dissenter was.   A spokesman for the American Express Company, Michael O'Neil, said he did not know if any other board members intended to retire."
