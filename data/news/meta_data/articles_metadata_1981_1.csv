A report prepared jointly for the President by the State Department and the Council on Environmental Quality warned that excessive world population growth, dwindling resources and environmental degradation represent serious threats to the political and economic security of the United States.   The 250-page report contains recommendations for action by the United States, in concert with other nations, including a doubling of international resources devoted to family planning, greatly increased food aid, global plans to reverse the depletion of world forests and the spreading of deserts, and the conservation of critical resources such as energy and water."

At a news conference, he estimated that the G.N.P. this year would rise 4.5 percent from the 1980 level to $150 billion."

The on-the-job study sessions, at which the latest party policy directives are read and discussed, deteriorated into poorly attended and mostly nonpolitical sessions for small talk after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. Attendance was not taken and participants often slept through the one or two meetings each week."

The new program generally prohibits homeowners or home purchasers from assuming conventional mortgages - that is, renewing them at the existing rate - when homeowners refinance their mortgages or when home purchasers combine the existing mortgage with an additional, or second, mortgage, financed by a mortgage lender. This latter procedure is known as a ''wrap-around.''   Last year, Fannie Mae said it would no longer buy mortgages that permitted a subsequent holder to assume the mortgage at the old rate unless state law so required. Today's action extends that policy to a larger class of mortgages, including many already in the association's portfolio."

NATO is providing much of the money to extend the runway of the island's airfield and build a port, but no details have been published on the military units that might use the facilities."

But few would guess that Linda Beltramini, a worldly citizen of Brazil, Britain and Switzerland, is also one of the toughest and sharpest of a new breed of financiers in the city: the secretive cadre that helps wealthy foreigners find ways of investing their money in the United States.   While her name is not well known outside a tight circle of investment advisers and foreign investors, she was identified recently as the architect of the $8 million sale of Henri Bendel to a Swiss group and the accompanying lease of Bendel's 57th Street store to other Swiss investors.   From a glance at her chauffeured Mercedes, her Fendi furs and her East Side town house, it is not readily apparent that the 34-yearold Mrs. Beltramini has run not one, but two, multimillion-dollar businesses."

Negotiated financings give the underwriters flexibility to bring new debt issues to market quickly if buyers are receptive or to withdraw them if buyers will not make commitments.   ''The waiting game is well entrenched,'' said Michael K. Dahood of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Investors are delaying commitments to long-term bonds,'' because of doubts that yields will decline in the near future, he said. At the same time ''issuers are holding back because of the volatility'' in rates, he added."

Regan, chairman of Merrill Lynch and President-elect Ronald Reagan's choice for Treasury Secretary, navigate the treacherous policy shoals as successfully as the Merrill Lynch bull steps around the china? Mr.  Regan faces a tricky passage from chief of one of the country's most powerful private financial institutions to the top of government finance. Wherever he turns at the Treasury, he will find old problems but a new perspective. Most of these problems, whether technical or headline-makers, will involve huge sums of money. Just how sensitive Mr. Regan is to the potential conflict between what has been good for Merrill Lynch and what will be good for the country may determine his success in the Reagan cabinet. Ironically, he faces perhaps more numerous potential policy conflicts than any recent Treasury Secretary precisely because, under him, Merrill Lynch has expanded successfully into virtually every aspect of the nation's financial life. Following are just a few examples."

As the single-digit bond yields of the 1970's were overtaken by double-digit inflation, many bondholders fled the market entirely.   Issuers, caught between their need for long-term money and the investor's demand for a decent return and preservation of capital, scratched their heads and came up with the floating-rate note. These are issues where the stated interest rate, or coupon, is adjusted periodically. Introduced in this country by Citicorp in 1974, there are now about $3.9 billion of them outstanding in the corporate market, with another several hundred million worth in the tax-exempt sector."

This battle, involving such esoteric financial instruments as options on Government-guaranteed mortgage certificates and futures and options contracts on Government securities and foreign currencies, is part of a larger philosophical struggle over the regulation of the futures market, the least-regulated and fastestgrowing financial market in the country.   Now, as a result of recent political and economic developments, the regulation of the futures market is attracting public attention on several new fronts. Further Hearings Scheduled   Democrats in Congress, spurred by last year's silver crisis, which was precipitated by the wealthy Hunt family, are conducting an intensive investigation into the futures market in general and the silver market in particular, with further hearings scheduled for next month.

While palm oil producers in Malaysia and processors of domestic corn, sunflowers, cottonseed and other oilseeds have benefited from changing American eating habits, such as the proliferation of salad bars in fast food and other restaurants, soybean oil futures prices, buffeted by a variety of factors, have been slumping since November.   Consumer resistance to relatively high beef and pork prices has caused record slaughter of cattle and hogs, which are two of the biggest markets for protein-rich livestock feed containing soybean meal. And now poultry raisers, who are also big bean meal buyers, are reducing their flocks."

As the President speaks to the nation this week on the economy, the difficult part of his budgetcutting blueprint lies ahead.   While analysts do not expect the speech to be heavily larded with specifics, they do think Mr. Reagan might mention some programs that are candidates for cuts.   Although some senators and representatives are expecting proposed expenditure reductions in all areas save defense and Social Security, some economists fail to see how significant budget reductions can be made without considering major entitlement programs. Specifically, an end to the tax-free status of Social Security benefits may be an important part of the President's proposals."

The publication, Defense Attache, suggests that one reason for the success of Israel's exports is that many of the weapons are ''combat proven.'' Another, the London publication said, is a high technological standard.   American and other analysts believe that the expansion of the Israeli arms industry has a significant influence on the balance of power in the Middle East. No potential Arab adversary has a comparable arms production capacity; in a war, they must rely on support from the United States, France, Britain or the Soviet Union."

An authoritative source described the Saudi request as being of such magnitude that it would surpass the simple sale of weapons systems and would represent, in terms of long-range involvement, the creation of a special relationship between West Germany and the world's largest oil exporter.   The Saudis, who made their request to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in November, have not listed their requirements precisely, the informant said, but hundreds of Leopard 2 tanks and more than a dozen separate weapons systems were involved. The size of the tank order was described as probably similar to one given by the Saudis to France for 370 AMX30's."

Yet, those of us who have an affinity with the theory find ourselves wary rather than jubilant. The rational expectations theory is based on two well-accepted economic assumptions. The first is that individuals and companies will try to maximize their own welfare - that is, they try to make their own economic and other circumstances as desirable as possible.  The second assumption is that, as individuals and companies make economic decisions in their own interest, they do so in such a way that markets ''clear.''

However, Mr. Lefever said in an interview this week that ''I look upon myself as a great advocate of human rights in a more profound and effective way.''   He opposes the use of punitive sanctions, such as the withdrawal of economic and military aid, from friendly but authoritarian foreign regimes because of human rights abuses. He said he is ''utterly convinced that the most effective way to get reform is quiet diplomacy'' and maintenance of friendly relations."

The reason: average cash margins required of speculators were much higher in most markets in 1980. Also, the unprecedented price volatility in most of the active commodity markets last year caused the thinly margined small speculators to be repeatedly whipsawed out of their positions."

Pitching machines that cost around $1,500 have been refined to the point where they can deliver any of the pitches in a major league pitcher's repertoire - including a devastating knuckle ball - at varying speeds and in different locations around the strike zone.   These are skills that, for the human being, involve extraordinary coordination, concentration and endurance. The machine's performance compares favorably with the level of mechanization of human skills achieved in using industrial robots in manufacturing processes."

French Transport Minister Daniel Hoeffel, saying France ''will not and cannot abandon Concorde,'' signed a new agreement with Air France this week. The French Government, which with Britain had spent more than $2 billion developing the world's first supersonic passenger aircraft, will pay 90 percent of the plane's estimated operating losses for the next three years, compared with 70 percent in the past."

Since May 1979, when Mrs. Thatcher led the Conservative Party to a sweeping victory, her administration's performance has been watched to see whether Britain's stagnant, inflation-ridden economy could be revived with strict fiscal discipline or whether it was perhaps irretrievably doomed to be a perpetual example of mismanagement.   But now, as Mrs. Thatcher copes with a rain of criticism, the Reagan team seems most impressed with how the public's impatience for solutions to pressing economic problems can so overwhelm a new Government that its policy initiatives are aborted or discredited before being tried.   David Stockman, Mr. Reagan's choice to head the Office of Management and Budget, sees a warning in Mrs. Thatcher's political difficulties."

In Teheran, the Government introduced two pieces of emergency legislation in Parliament to help expedite an agreement. One would authorize the Government to conduct binding arbitration regarding claims against Iran's frozen assets in the United States; the other would ''nationalize'' the wealth of the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi and 53 of his relatives.

Now is a good time to do this since the natural seasons for actually performing such work are spring and summer.   There is no simple answer to the question of whether to convert.  Not only are there vast differences in individual heating and financial situations, but also the decision rests largely on assumptions that are made about the future price and availability of the two fuels, an exercise that in recent years has defied rational prediction. Ten years ago, for example, who would have thought that the price of oil would quintuple during the decade?"

The Ayatollah's endorsement - necessary for any major move - was announced during the evening by Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai after a meeting with the revolutionary leader.   But the precise terms of the Algerian role and the state of the negotiations remained unknown, and Mr. Rajai's remarks themselves created further confusion and uncertainty. Ambiguous Term Causes Confusion   The confusion stemmed from the Prime Minister's use of the Persian word ''tahod,'' which can be translated as meaning either ''undertaking'' or ''guarantee.'' In the context of his remarks, the difference is critical."

OFFERS TO CUT GUERRILLA TIES IN EFFORT TO SPUR NAMIBIA TALKS,"  In an effort to get serious negotiations under way at the conference on South-West Africa here, the United Nations offered today to take steps to break its ties with the insurgent movement known as the South-West Africa People's Organization in exchange for South Africa's agreement on a date for a cease-fire in the disputed territory.   The offer came in a statement by Brian Urquhart, an Under Secretary General serving as chairman of the meeting, who was responding to a series of scathing attacks on the United Nations as well as on the insurgents by representatives of political parties from the territory who have been seated here as members of the South African delegation.    In an unusually vituperative address to the conference yesterday, for instance, Katuutire Kaura of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance maintained that the international organization had disqualified itself as an impartial supervisor of a transition to independence in the territory, known widely as Namibia, by its support of ''an organization of schoolchildren-kidnappers, rapist thugs and bandits.''"

The label of another brand, Alpen Zauber, touts a ''Swiss commitment to excellence.'' But Alpen Zauber is made entirely in Brooklyn. And Frusen Gladje? The company is incorporated in Stockholm, but every scoop comes from Utica, N.Y.   All three - and a stubbornly American fourth, Bassetts - have discovered the high-quality, high-priced ice cream market. And all four, with or without the cachet of an unpronounceable name, are expanding beyond their traditional niches in regional markets in an attempt to win a place beside the Sealtest and Breyer's brands, the giants of the industry.   While the market for so-called luxury ice creams remains small - 11 percent of the $2 billion total that the Washington-based International Association of Ice Cream Manufacturers says Americans spend for ice cream - it is growing fast. Last year, sales of luxury ice creams jumped 17 percent while the overall market increased only 1 percent."

In a week that both sides were eager to portray as an important watershed in the relationship between their nations, Mr. Shagari was treated by businessmen, by the Government, by the royal family and by private citizens as the much-respected leader of a country that is not only very large and very rich but also - just lately - democratic.  Mr. Shagari, who came to office in October 1979 after 13 years of military rule in Nigeria, is one of the third world's few democratically elected heads of state. His civilian Government is patterned after that of the United States, and the British have been eager to accord it as much official approval as possible."

The latest complaint, which was expected to be delivered in Moscow by the American Embassy, concerned a dispatch by Tass, the Soviet press agency, asserting that Central Intelligence Agency psychologists in Wiesbaden, West Germany, were brainwashing the released Americans to rid them of favorable views about Iran that they had gained while in captivity.   William J. Dyess, the acting State Department spokesman, said the Soviet allegation was ''absolutely scurrilous.'' Last Saturday, with the negotiations with Iran in their final phase, Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie summoned the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly F.

Stockman, director-designate of the Office of Management and Budget, said today.   The move is expected to raise within weeks the price of gasoline and heating oil by perhaps 5 to 10 cents a gallon, according to independent analysts. But the impact on consumers would be limited because under existing legislation controls were scheduled to expire Sept. 30, resulting in similar price rises then.   The comment by Mr. Stockman, confirmed by a well-placed Department of Energy source, was the strongest indication so far that controls, which limit the retail price of gasoline and propane and the price that producers can charge for several categories of crude oil, would be ended in the next few days. The controls were imposed more than nine years ago; the decontrol process has been under way since April 1979."

But whatever part of the blame is truly ascribable to the government, and there is certainly some, it is clear that much of the productivity problem lies within the jurisdiction of the private sector. The productivity problem will only be cured if the private sector is willing to cure itself.   Within the private sector it is fashionable for management to point to a deterioration in labor's ''work ethic.'' The belief that the next generation has less of the work ethic than the last generation has at least a 2,000-year history, but the key to productivity is not the work ethic. A willingness or unwillingness to give up coffee breaks is ultimately unimportant."

The European auto industry, like its American counterpart, is facing a saturated market with excess production capacity at a time when the Japanese are mounting a massive marketing assault.  Moreover, some of Europe's auto makers are saddled with an aging line of models and lack the capital to make rapid changes themselves."

Spain's democratic Constitution is only two years old, and the country's political parties, particularly the governing Union of the Democratic Center, have been severely strained by factionalism and the pressures of regional loyalties. In the case of the ruling party, the effects of its internal disagreements have been compounded by its minority status in the lower house of Parliament.   Mr. Suarez, who was named by King Juan Carlos in 1976, had been Prime Minister of Spain longer than anyone else in this century. He presided over his party's quarrelsome factions by staying above them; he prepared no smooth succession, evidently hoping that the party would eventually call him back after his dramatic resignation last Thursday."

Eighty-seven powerful electric trains under construction for the 264-mile line connecting Paris and Lyons will be able to climb grades more than three times steeper than those on existing lines. Carrying up to 386 pasengers, they will initially cruise at 160 miles an hour and eventually at nearly 190 miles an hour on smooth, welded track with no crossings and no slow freight trains.   Along 45 miles of the route the double-track railroad will closely parallel a new ''autoroute,'' the French version of an Interstate highway, undertaking grades of as much as 35 percent, or 16 degrees, according to the French engineers, in order to have long straight stretches."

""And, as socially and politically the country is goint to the right, too."" An important test will come in February when Vicente Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon, the Archbishop of Madrid, steps down as president of the Episcopal Conference. In the hierarchy's top job since 1972, the 73-yearold prelate has been an open-minded conciliator among the Spanish church's several families; he sheltered foes of the Franco regime and tried to keep his bishops out of politics in the tense months after the dictator's death in November 1975.  Since King Juan Carlos has renounced the privilege Franco had of naming bishops, the Vatican's influence in the Episcopal Conference has steadily grown, and Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon's successor will doubtless have the Pope's approval. Both conservatives and liberals have their favorites, but one leading compromise candidate acceptable to Rome is Jose Delicado Baeza, the 53-year-old Bishop of Valladolid.  Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon successfully opposed the establishment of an Italian-style Christian Democratic party in Spain, which would have overtly involved the church in politics, and he muffled rightist clerical protests against the democratic Constitution that was adopted in 1978. The Constitution disestablished the church, but it notes the special place of the Catholic faith.  However, one strong faction within Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez's governing Union of the Democratic Center considers itself ""Christian Democratic,"" and, in Parliament, has successfully defended the maintenance of subsidies to church schools."

Solomon, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, warned the state's bankers yesterday against moving too much of their business outside New York.   Mr. Solomon, in a speech before the midwinter meeting of the New York State Bankers Association at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, asserted that the city's banks might be ''inadvertently undermining'' New York's strength as a money center. This, he said, ''is neither in New York's interest - both city and state - nor ultimately in the banks' own interests.''   In an interview following his address, Mr. Solomon declined to specify the banks to which he was referring. But in private conversations, most bankers attending the conference were excited about legislation pending in Delaware that would allow out-of-state banks to establish banks in that state.

The previous strikes and strike threats by Solidarity, the union organization, were over lofty principles - the right to unionize independently of the Communist Party, to legally register the unions and to enforce wage agreements. These were bedrock matters, relating to the union's very right and reason to exist and as such were readily grasped by every Polish worker.   The current strikes center upon an item that is less compelling, Solidarity's insistence upon an immediate five-day workweek. It is not a well-chosen cry for a return to the barricades. Many workers, impressed by the daily mounting evidence of the deteriorating economy, feel that perhaps they should work at least some Saturdays for the good of mother Poland."

Wiig, chief analyst and energy officer of the State Department of Planning and Economic Development, Hawaii not only leads all the other states in projects to extract electricity from sun, wind, sea water, volcanic heat and plant life, but is ''a laboratory for the world'' in this field.   Among the new energy systems already working here, albeit on a small scale, are these:   * The Kilauea Volcano project on the island of Hawaii, already working a generator and ready to be attached to a turbine linked to the local commercial grid.   * A floating rig off the west coast of the island of Hawaii, which draws power for its own operation from the interaction of warm and cold sea water in a process known as ocean thermal energy conversion."

No one in Washington or in American military bases at home or abroad is clamoring for action, but it is clear that more attention is being paid now to military means of breaking the deadlock than was true six weeks ago.   The theme in all these discussions was that since the failure of the American rescue mission in April, Iran's military situation has changed drastically because of Iraq's invasion on Sept. 22.   None of those consulted believed that a second rescue mission would be easy or that it would be possible to avoid casualties among the rescued and the rescuers. The great majority, however, emphasized that the Persian Gulf war was a new element in discussions of military options."

With the cost of oil still climbing and Europe's economies locked in another downturn, West Germany, too, had run out of steam and its leaders were becoming increasingly pessimistic about 1981.

It is a complex situation, but we have to move fairly promptly to get it resolved so that we can get back to running a business. That is in everybody's general interest.'' Itel failed when it overstretched its computer business. Five years ago, it began marketing computers in head-on competition with the International Business Machines Corporation in the so-called plugcompatible market. Sales of its computers increased from 40 in 1977 to 240 a year in 1978, and Itel predicted that sales would continue to grow rapidly. But early in 1979, I.B.M. shocked the computer industry with the announcement of a new line of computers, the E series, before it was actually available. Customers stopped taking rival equipment until they could see just what the new I.B.M.  machines offered."

Although options have been around for years, they did not catch on until three or four years ago at relatively conservative organizations. Now there is a growing realization at major corporations, pension funds, colleges and other organizations that options can serve many purposes, such as helping increase return on investments or protecting securities at a time of price declines.   Quite simply, a stock option involves a ''call'' or a ''put.'' For example, the buyer of a call option, which covers 100 shares of stock, has the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares during a stipulated period for a stated price. A put option involves the reverse - the buyer pays for the privilege of selling 100 shares of stock at a certain price during a stated period, if he wishes.  Brokers, of course, charge commissions. There are many complex ways of using options in portfolio management."

The setting is ready for negotations. A long table with microphones is neatly arranged in the meeting hall of the building on Liberty Square.

Approximately $3.6 billion of that sum would go directly from the Bank of England to pay off Iran's bank loans, and $1.5 billion would go into escrow until other bank loans and claims were resolved.   Representatives of the banks said they were satisfied with the agreement and expressed surprise at how forthcoming the Iranians had become at the 11th hour."

Its stock closed at 38 3/4 yesterday, up sharply from a 1980 low of about $14. The fuel for this rise is not Chris-Craft's operating earnings, described by analysts as mediocre at best, but its ownership of nearly 23 percent of the outstanding common shares of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation.

The expectation is that sometime in the next few weeks the Reagan Administration and Bell may reach a settlement of the antitrust suit. There is a deadline of tomorrow set by the United States District Court for reaching such a settlement but the Justice Department has already said that the Reagan Administration would not be able to meet the deadline. Thus the trial is expected to resume Wednesday even though chances are considered good that an outside settlement will be reached eventually."

Seagram & Sons said yesterday that it was offering $45 a share, totaling more than $2 billion in cash, for the nation's No.1 lead producer.   The price, almost three times St. Joe's book value of $16.50 a share, brought immediate resistance from the company and widespread conjecture that other bidders would soon come forward to touch off a heated takeover battle.   Wall Street analysts have been suggesting privately that many of the nation's biggest natural resource companies will eventually come under siege from major oil companies looking for diversification candidates.   The Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which already shares major coal operations with St. Joe, was viewed as a possible contender against Seagram. The Newmont Mining Corporation owns 7.3 percent of St. Joe, but its attitude could not be immediately determined."

Assuming Congressional approval, 139.5 million ounces of bullion would be marketed at the rate of about a million ounces a week over the next three years, officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said today.   The Administration's budget last week did not specifically call for disposing of silver, but its plan to raise some $500 million from stockpile sales has inevitably led F.E.M.A. managers to sell these stocks."

''I have extended to General Viola my best wishes for his tenure as president,'' Mr. Reagan said.  Earlier today, General Viola met informally with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill, where he was said to have pledged to make more of an effort to identify some of the 6,000 people reported to have been arrested or abducted by Argentine security forces."

Regulators, Professor Weidenbaum has prominently argued, should be required by law to prove that the measurable benefits of a proposed regulation exceed measurable costs. In theory, this sounds like sheer common sense. Still, at least five major Federal studies have concluded that in practice, costbenefit analysis is, as the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee put it last month, ''simply too primitive a tool to make a decisive factor in rule-making.'' So before President Reagan proposes new legislation to mandate cost-benefit tests Governmentwide, he would do well to consider its operational shortcomings - to conduct, if you will, a cost-benefit analysis of cost-benefit analysis."

Stockman. Although Mr. Reagan insisted he did not want to subject his audience to a ''jumble of charts, figures and economic jargon,'' he set out to explain ''where we are, how we got there and how we can get back'' - in effect, laying out an economic primer that might lead the American public to understand and support his effort to ''turn things around.''   How accurate and well founded was this economic primer? And is this the worst economic mess since the Great Depression?  Since ''mess'' is not a well-defined economic term, it is difficult to confirm or refute his statement, but it seems exaggerated.  Unemployment, as reported yesterday, is now at 7.4 percent of the civilian labor force. In 1975 unemployment averaged 8.5 percent. (As a comparison, in 1933 unemployment averaged 24.9 percent.)"

In at least the Administration's opening weeks, the New York-based economic consultant and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers has emerged as a major outside influence on Mr. Reagan's economic policy.   From that perch, he has served as a moderating presence in an Administration laden with unorthodox economic views, particularly those of supply-side economists who are seeking big tax cuts to spur investment. By all accounts, Mr. Greenspan was instrumental in a number of key decisions, such as to publish a somewhat optimistic economic forecast rather than what many considered the wildly optimistic outlook advanced by a number of Administration economists."

Almost immediately after 12 members of the 15-member board of directors voted to remove Sir Hugh, whose father founded the huge chain, Roland Rowland, chief executive of Lonrho Ltd., announced he was initiating yet another bid to gain control of the House of Fraser. The move could cost cash-rich Lonrho some $542 million if it is successful."

Many analysts both inside and outside government see the hand of the State Department, which lost some important trade battles during the Carter Administration, being strengthened at the expense of the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the Commerce Department.   The result, the analysts say, could be a greater diffusion of authority in the trade field instead of the centralization that had been a goal of both the Carter Administration and trade specialists on Capitol Hill in recent years."

I pointed out to them that since their capture by the Iranian terrorists and their being held in this despicable act of savagery, that the American peoples' hearts have gone out to them; that our nation has been united as perhaps never before in history, and that the prayers that have gone up from the people around the world to God, for their safety, have finally been answered.   I pointed out that the Iranian Working Group within the State Department, set up the very day they were captured, has functioned 24 hours a day and will still be in existence until they're all safely at home with their own families.   This dedication has been mirrored by the hundreds of millions of people in our country whose hearts have gone out to these heroes."

Now, six decades later, the weather remains a hugely important matter for farms and for a myriad of other enterprises, and in the last several months, Miss Cather's great fact has in many ways been unusually unfavorable to the economic affairs of businessmen and consumers as well as farm folk.   A shortage of water reserves has been worrying businessmen as well as consumers through much of the country. In atypically arid Illinois, the Emergency Services and Disaster Agency has been urging such water-intensive businesses as Laundromats and car-washes to cut back their water use, or shut down entirely. Mayor Koch has declared a drought emergency in New York City, and the governors of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware have jointly imposed a ban on nonessential water uses in 462 communities because of a deepening water shortage in the Delaware water basin."

Although analysts caution that a sharp run-up in prices may yet come, the general economic slump in the industrialized world and some previously absent cooperation among consuming nations has dampened demand for oil and eased price pressures. Nevertheless, the price of oil has increased from about $5 a barrel in 1973 to between $32 a barrel and $41 a barrel today with telling effect on the world's economy."

But for most of the people who have them, employment contracts are more reflective of such mundane concerns as job security and pensions.   Historically, the individual employment contract has been restricted to a few top officers, though unionized employees are already under contract, and some companies resist giving out contracts at all. That situation is changing, however. In hightechnology companies, such as those of Silicon Valley in California, middle-level engineers and scientists who are in great demand and short supply may also be signed to contracts. And according to Richard Cummins, a partner with Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, many other industries experiencing shortages of talented professionals and executives are starting to give contracts to middle managers to deter them from job-hopping."

According to official reports, his eyes were badly bruised, one lung was full of liquid, his body was covered with hematomas, or swollen areas full of blood, and the soles of his feet had been burned. Such injuries would tend to confirm a recent report by Amnesty International that said torture was still practiced by the police in Spain."

A modest $500 million decline in the basic money supply announced yesterday by the Federal Reserve added fuel to predictions that interest rates would continue to decline gradually. So far, the Marine Midland Bank has been the only other of the 20 largest banks to cut its rate to 19 1/2 percent.

The decision by Mr. Reagan to affirm his commitment to the normalization agreement and to seek an improvement in relations is regarded by some officials as one of the Administration's first major actions, even though it has received relatively little public attention up to now.   Because of Mr. Reagan's past criticism of the normalization agreement and his comments during the campaign indicating a desire to upgrade relations with Taiwan, the Chinese viewed the advent of his Administration with considerable concern, officials said. The Taiwanese, whose formal ties to Washington were severed at the same time as the agreement was reached with China, were anticipating some major symbolic gesture from the White House to reflect Mr. Reagan's sentiments."

Today, Mr. Sporkin and the enforcement division he has headed since 1974 are under fire from some of President Reagan's supporters. Mr.  Sporkin and his troops have become the most visible symbols of the commission's reputation for vigorous, nonpartisan independence.

The conference is the culmination of a diplomatic initiative started nearly four years ago by five Western nations - the United States, Britain, France, West Germany and Canada - that undertook to help promote an agreement between South Africa and an insurgent movement called the South-West Africa People's Organization.   A collapse in negotiations here, Western diplomats fear, could lead directly to a showdown in the Security Council in which the Western nations would be called on to support sanctions against South Africa - precisely the situation the Western initiative was meant to avoid.   Mr. Waldheim emphasized that the basic terms of a settlement had been accepted by both sides as long ago as 1978. ''There can be no question of renegotiating these fundamental arrangements or of going back on agreements previously reached,'' he said. ''Rather, the job here is to set these agreements and proposals into confident motion.''"

The move for more regimentation is directed first at Turkey's huge, lax administration and the unruly schools, but it threatens to spill over into the press and other sectors.   In their drive against politics and politicians, the military rulers have brought many retired officers into the administration and public enterprises, and they seem sure to leave their mark.   Hundreds of retired officers have replaced political bureaucrats as ministers, under secretaries, deputy under secretaries and directors general as well as governors and mayors. Military personnel are also being introduced in a watchdog capacity in the ministries."

One out of three middle managers are estimated to have resumes in circulation at this moment. Turnover is one of the most neglected problems in business.

Some cautious diplomats said they thought the appointment of Gen.  Woiciech Jaruzelski as Prime Minister - a move that was almost certainly approved by Moscow in advance - represented a last chance for the Warsaw Government to put its affairs in order.   None of those who made such ominous comments pretended to have any inside information about Soviet intentions; the Kremlin is not in the habit of leaking its plans. So few diplomats were making forecasts.  But many said the pattern of events, together with the increasingly strident comments in the Soviet press, suggested that the Soviet leadership was losing patience with the Poles."

Due to growing price-consciousness among middle-income and even affluent consumers, there has been a burgeoning recently in the number of outlets that sell brand-name clothing at prices signficantly below those of conventional retailers.   While stores such as Loehmann's and Barney's in New York and Filene's in Boston (in its famous bargain basement) have discounted brand-name merchandise for years, and a number of factories have long sold imperfect or excess production through their own outlets, the price-cutting business is now making major inroads on traditional retailing.   According to Management Horizons, a management consultant firm specializing in retailing, based in Columbus, Ohio, the nation's 10,000 off-price stores, as they are called in the parlance of the trade, accounted for approximately $3 billion in 1979, or between 4 and 5 percent of total retail apparel sales. By 1985, the firm estimates that such sales will account for between 10 and 13 percent of all apparel purchases."

Born to a poor Neapolitan family, he rose from illiterate urchin to shoemaker for royalty, was ruined by the Depression, again by World War II and recovered more spectacularly each time.   At his unexpected death, his young widow, Wanda Ferragamo, who was left with six children and who had never dealt with such things as checkbooks, plunged into the business. Gradually, the children have joined the company, expanding it into a multimillion-dollar international enterprise.   In 1962, Ferragamo made 800 pairs of shoes a month. Today, eight factories turn out 60,000 pairs monthly of what might well be the world's most expensive ready-made shoes, selling for $100 to $300.  The family can't keep up with the demand."

But the European and Latin American support has been muted, State Department officials said today, by concern that the new Administration might be too concerned about the military aspects of the problem, too interested in forcing the issue with Moscow and Havana and not committed enough to curbing violent acts by the Salvadoran right wing and to seeking a political solution.

But that scenario has changed abruptly, as inflation - and interest rates - have soared, driving bond prices down and challenging investment bankers to come up with ever-new ways to slake borrowers' thirsts for long-term funds.   ''You've seen more innovative bond deals in the past year than in the previous two decades,'' noted Frederick H. Joseph, who heads the corporate finance department at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc."

The emergence of the new party, which already has 14 Members of Parliament and a wide measure of public support, was a historic milestone, raising the possibility of a basic realignment in British politics and a move away from the two-party system.   Staking out a position in the ideological center, between the Labor and Conservative Parties, the Social Democrats hope to attract disillusioned supporters from both. They said in a statement today:   ''Britain needs a reformed and liberated political system without the pointless conflict, the dogma, the violent lurches of policy and the class antagonisms that the two old parties have fostered.''"

Mr. Eagleburger presented intelligence reports that are said to show that the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Communist nations have been providing military aid to the Salvadoran guerrillas. The object of the mission is to persuade Europeans to back the American policy of support for the Salvadoran junta, and to end political or other backing for the rebels.

In 1962, the Civil Service and military pension systems were indexed to the Consumer Price Index. Total outlays for the programs amounted to $2 billion or 1.9 percent of the total Federal budget. After that, indexing proceeded gradually -until it took a giant leap forward in 1975 with the implementation of indexing for the Social Security System. By 1980, $173.5 billion of outlays, or 29.9 percent of the budget, was linked to one or another price index and the proportion can be expected to rise in the future. As the Congress enacted more and more indexing, it lost more and more control over budget totals. To forecast total spending in any one year, it is now necessary to forecast the movement of a number of price indexes, and that is a hazardous occupation."

The dispute between the two companies is the latest in a stormy relationship that began in 1973, when Robot-Coupe first introduced its food processor to America. The product, invented by Pierre Verdun a decade earlier, was sold through department stores under the trademark Cuisinart, which was inspired by its exclusive American distributor, Cuisinarts Inc., a wholesaler of cookware based in Greenwich, Conn. The French-made multipurpose kitchen appliance rapidly became a best seller in the $100-and-up ''luxury'' end of the food processor market."

American and West German officials regarded the meetings of the socalled Scandilux group - the Dutch, Belgians, Danes and Norwegians - with concern. They thought that the movement might gain enough momentum to impede deployment of the missiles and create new public opinion problems, notably in West Germany and Italy, concerning this security issue.   Now, after a second meeting of the group in Oslo on March 14 and a conference of Western European Socialist leaders in Paris last week, the attempt to enlist support for the Dutch position seems at least temporarily blunted. The language of the Dutch Socialists, who hope to return to power in elections on May 26, has not essentially changed, but there seems to be no inclination among other countries to join them and their supporters in the ranks of Belgium's Flemish Socialist Party. Instead, the Dutch Socialists appear relatively isolated and may be dampening their tone."

As the strike approached, American and British television network correspondents were refused permission to use Polish facilities to transmit reports.   Once before, on Oct. 3, the union conducted a one-hour nationwide ''warning'' strike to press for promised wage increases. But at that point its membership was only a fraction of the 10 million it now claims.

Mr. Begin is described by his aides as supporting such a timetable if he cannot resolve an angry controversy within his Government over teachers' salaries, the latest of a long series of issues that have split the coalition and whittled away its majority in Parliament.   ''We don't want to have a Government for 9, 10, 11 months based on the shifting sands of the desert,'' said Yehuda Ben-Meir, chairman of the parliamentary faction of the National Religious Party, a key coalition partner with Mr. Begin's Likud faction.   According to the latest public opinion polls, the Likud bloc would lose badly to the opposition Labor Party if elections were held now, capturing only 20 or 21 of the 120 seats in Parliament to Labor's 57. Another recent survey, carried in the daily newspaper Haaretz, showed 50.5 percent of the people favoring a change of government, and 40.5 percent wanting Mr. Begin's coalition to serve out its term until next November."

Since future changes in short-term interest rates will depend largely on the balance between the credit needs of the economy and the credit supplied to the banking system by the Federal Reserve, the markets are closely watching the Fed for clues of its intentions.    While many analysts expect the economy to weaken and interest rates to decline over this year's first half, that forecast is not universal.   ''Prospects are clearly waning for a significant decline in the economy, inflation, credit demands, or interest rates any time soon,'' said Philip Braverman, an economist at Chase Manhattan, for example."

The striking progress registered by the Socialist union, which pulled to nearly equal strength with the Workers' Commissions in balloting that began in October, was also an unspoken victory for Spain's new business executive's organization. Under the deft guidance of Carlos Ferrer Salat, a Catalan electronics executive and a one-time Davis Cup tennis star, the Spanish Business Confederation has achieved a major goal: clipping the Communists' wings.   Ministry of Labor figures show that 30.7 percent of the 158,454 factory delegates elected over the past four months were from the Workers' Commissions, 29.6 percent from the General Workers' Union and 9.4 percent from the Workers' Union, a Government-backed group.

A few service stations still offer maps, but only reluctantly, and most of those charge for them - usually 75 cents to $1.

But the headlong rush by major oil companies to purchase natural resource concerns is hardly a laughing matter to a growing number of economists who worry that the purchases may not represent the most efficient use of scarce capital.

A chief spokesman is Dr. Robert A. Frosch, who recently became the first president of the American Association of Engineering Societies, a year-old federation of 39 societies with a combined membership of nearly one million engineers.   Dr. Frosch, formerly the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, talked recently about the problems of the engineering profession and its role in rebuilding American industry.   Q. Why is an umbrella organization representing all engineers needed? A. The need is particularly acute because we have been in a period, from which I hope we're emerging, in which it has been in fashion to believe that engineering was not very important. It was kind of the ''Greening of America'' fashion. It was an invention of ignorance and know-nothingism."

The compact, single story brick building sits not far from the road, the modest front lawn devoid of fountain, pool or waterfall that would mark the building as home of the nation's largest publicly traded water utility holding company, serving more than 500 communities in 20 states.   American Water Works has found that being No. 1 among publicly held water companies is not quite the same as being the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in the telephone industry. On Wall Street, the company paddles in the backwaters of the financial action. A water expert at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Steven Hanke, calls the water utilities a ''forgotten industry.''   Forgotten, that is, until there is a drought and customers start worrying that their taps will go dry. Then the water utilities face regulatory and political pressures that normally focus on their larger and more costly brethren, the electric, gas and telephone companies. The water utilities find themselves hiring publicrelations experts and defending themselves against charges of failure to plan ahead."

They have thus far failed to achieve a consensus, and these issues will confront the foreign ministers when the conference officially opens tomorrow:   - Pakistan, acting on behalf of a the Islamic bloc, has proposed a resolution on Afghanistan that reportedly does not mention the Soviet Union but calls for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops.  Afghanistan, with the support of the Cubans and the Vietnamese, is trying to delete any reference to foreign intervention."

Charges of wrongdoing by local officials, and charges that the central party administration was doing nothing about it, were major factors in many of the wildcat strikes that seized the country last week.   Even today, when the rest of Poland has fallen quiet, the local chapter of Solidarity, the independent trade union organization, in the southern town of Bielsko-Biala is continuing strikes because it wants five administrators booted out of office for corruption.   Some 67 Communist officials had been expelled from the party for corruption by November, when the party's ''cleansing'' purge was at its height, and 79 had received lesser penalties. But they are believed to represent only a minute fraction of those who fell under the spell of fast and easy money and lavish living under the deposed party leader, Edward Gierek, and are still in power."

But they need not feel alone in their agony.   In the last year sluggish demand in the economy along with persistent inflation and vanishing profits have led several beleaguered companies in declining industries to demand cost savings concessions from their employees.   In recent months, such companies as Armour, Conrail and Firestone, in addition to Chrysler and Uniroyal have won substantive changes in previously negotiated wages or work rules. International Harvester took a bitter and costly six-month strike last year to change its work rules and reduce its labor costs."

''There should be little doubt,'' said Philip Braverman, an economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank, that ''a further substantial rise in market rates'' is likely in the weeks ahead. He said the increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent in producer prices in January was ''almost certainly the beginning of an acceleration'' and that the economy was likely to show inflation-adjusted growth in this year's first quarter.   Many analysts contend that borrowing by the United States Treasury will play a key role in any move to higher interest rates. If the economy is weakening, they explain, private credit demands of individuals and businesses will grow less rapidly, which will make it easier for the Treasury to borrow without causing higher interest rates. If the economy is expanding, even slowly, the credit demands of the private sector are larger and compete with the still-heavy borrowing needs of the Treasury. The result is higher interest rates."

Mayor Stobbe, who shuffled his administration last week in an attempt to meet two crises - a housing shortage that has led to clashes between squatters and policemen, and a financial scandal involving the loss of $57 million loan guarentees - warned of severe repercussions in Bonn if his coalition was ousted or broke apart.

''Those banks that depended on very short-term funds to finance longer-term loans and investments were penalized, and those that purchased money at considerably lower rates during the summer and early fall were handsomely rewarded,'' said Thomas H. Hanley, vice president and manager of bank research at Salomon Brothers.   Primarily as a result of the higher interest rates, earnings of the Western Bancorporation soared, making it the most profitable by far of the nation's 15 largest bank holding companies. Western, with total assets of $32.1 billion at the end of last year, is the nation's ninth-largest bank holding company."

Consider the 1979 inflationary facts of life. During the course of that year, productivity (output per hour of work) fell 2 percent and rising OPEC oil prices took an extra 2 percent of the American gross national product. This meant that the nation could only have a noninflationary society in 1980 if the average American's income fell 4 percent.   Wages (and other incomes) must fall 2 percent to reflect the fact that American workers are 2 percent less efficient. If wages don't fall, prices must go up 2 percent to cover the new, higher labor costs of production. But domestic prices must do more than remain constant, they must also fall to counterbalance the new higher prices of the imported oil. This can only happen if there is an additional fall in wages."

As a result, life insurance companies have found it costly to write new business - particularly so in view of the fact that many customers tend to let their policies lapse after a short while. The Life Insurance Fact Book shows a lapse rate for policies in force less than two years of more than 19 percent over most of the last 10 years.   Obviously, the situation is far from ideal. Besides, agents are meeting resistance from prospects who regard life insurance as a deferrable purchase at a time when household budgets are under severe inflationary pressure."

The Treasury's ''back door,'' as the bank is sometime called because it borrows from the Treasury to relend chiefly to other Federal agencies, lends also to allies of the United States to help them purchase American military hardware.   A little-noticed report by the bank, which was set up in 1973 to consolidate agency borrowing, shows it now has $7.7 billion in loans outstanding for foreign military sales, representing nearly 10 percent of its outstanding loan total of $88.4 billion.

The start of a brief exchange of small-town pleasantries, it was an exceptional moment of civility in the life of officially decreed hardship and monotony Mrs. Mandela has had to lead here since she was ordered nearly four years ago to reside in the nameless black township on the edge of this staunchly conservative Afrikaner farming community in the Orange Free State. The banished wife of an imprisoned black leader would not expect to make white friends here.  Whites prepared to extend even minimal courtesy have also been few.   ''There are only three I am able to speak to here and she's one of the three,'' Mrs. Mandela said later, breaking into a bright peal of laughter that canceled any hint of self-pity. In the 18 years since the arrest of Nelson Mandela, the leader of the outlawed African National Congress, his wife has become a political figure in her own right, threatening enough for the authorities to feel they could not let her live in Soweto, Johannesberg's black annex, even under partial house arrest and a ''banning'' order that gagged her politically and barred her from gatherings."

Seibert, Penney's chairman, said that the company decided that the resources needed to makethe 34-store Treasury division viable and profitable ''can be deployed more productively in other activities.''   Discount store merchants, who generally try to sell at lower prices because they operate on a lower cost basis than traditional retailers, have come under heavy pressure over the last year because of the twin obstacles of increasing overhead and reduced consumer buying. Most discounters do not offer the same services of the conventional merchants such as deliveries, alterations, layaways or a broad policy of credit availability."

And its efforts come as company officials are deciding whether to shift more of their own production and assembly overseas to seek cost advantages.   As recently as September 1977, Ford's former chairman, Henry Ford 2d, confidently declared, ''We will push them back to the shores,'' when asked about imports. But lately, Ford officials have been pressing for a halving of imports for the next five years."

But since then, misgivings and uncertainty about the antibribery statute have increased steadily among both business executives and Government officials in trade-promoting agencies such as the Commerce Department.   Bipartisan support for amendments to the law now seems to be growing in Congress, and it is considered almost certain that the Reagan Administration will be more receptive to such amendments than the Carter Administration.   Congress foresaw that the ban on corporate bribery might cost American companies some business overseas, but concluded that the benefits outweighed the costs. Enacted in the wake of the Watergate scandals and after the disclosure of questionable payments by more than 400 major companies, the law was seen as an expression of foreign policy that would foster friendly, stable relations abroad."

He states that the use of slack to reduce the inflation rate by 1 percentage point during a year would require the loss in G.N.P. of $150 billion.

Marcos spent most of today in consultations with his Cabinet and top military commanders in what was described as an appraisal of the economic, social and political situation prior to the expected lifting of martial law.   The Government-controlled press has been reporting, on the basis of briefings at the presidential palace, that the end of martial law, decreed by Mr. Marcos more than eight years ago, may come as early as Saturday.   While Mr. Marcos met with his National Security Council, officially enlarged to include all Cabinet members, about 200 opposition figures held a news conference to condemn the President's impending action as a sham and to demand ''a dismantling of the Marcos dictatorship.''   ''On the basis of the announcements so far made by Marcos, it would appear that only two of the visible and repulsive symbols of martial law will be phased out: the military tribunals and the army detention centers,'' the United Democratic Opposition declared.  ''Everything else will be as it has been during eight years of 'martial law:' no free press, no free speech, no peaceful assembly, no independent legislative body and no rule of law.''"

In separate interviews recently, the Commander in Chief of the armed forces, the Minister of Defense and the Commander of the National Guard presented a less dire picture of the Communist military threat than the one that appears to be circulating in Washington.   They agreed with Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. that the most urgent objective was to curtail the flow of weapons to the guerrillas, and they welcomed military aid from Washington, particularly helicopters and equipment for a planned 2,000-member mobile force.   But they said the roots of the war in this impoverished country, after 50 years of rightist dictatorship, were internal social and economic problems that are at least as pressing as the guerrilla threat."

But C. Richard Youngdahl, former chairman and a director of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Government securities dealer, sees a common thread stretching from today's volatile credit markets back to 1950-51. At that time, the Federal Reserve created a furor in the financial markets by raising interest rates from the low levels that it had set during World War II and maintained in the years immediately afterward.   ''It has taken almost 30 years for the Fed to learn that controlling interest rates is not its job,'' he said. ''I hope they just don't forget it again.''"

Haig Jr. pursues a single-minded anti-Soviet strategy in the region.   Publicly, President Reagan has spoken of the need for ''an American presence'' in the Middle East and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger has spelled out even more ambitious plans than did the Carter Administration for the Rapid Deployment Force.   Privately, Administration officials talk not only of modest forward facilities in Oman or at Berbera, in Somalia, but hope for even more important ''safe rear'' facilities at Ras Banas, the isolated Egyptian port on the Red Sea, or across the sea in Saudi Arabia. Such a secure facility could provide barracks, longer airstrips and supplies for American forces in case of an emergency."

Ian Paisley, making a dramatic show of Protestant force, secretly gathered 500 men into a military formation on a bleak hillside in Northern Ireland late last night and vowed that they were prepared to fight ''to the death'' against reunification with the Irish Republic.   ''This is only a small token of the many thousands of men who are pledged to me, and I pledged to them, to stand together at this time of grave trouble in Northern Ireland,'' declared Mr. Paisley, who is a member of the British Parliament and a leading political figure in the Protestant majority in the province.   The midnight demonstration, which prompted angry allegations that Mr. Paisley was forming a private army to fight Roman Catholics, was the latest reflection of heightened tensions in the province.  Sectarian violence increased after a Christmas lull, and yesterday prisoners who favor reunification threatened to stage a new hunger strike in support of their demand for political status."

Mr. Zimmerman must also translate the Bible into another culture, one in which, among other things, kings and ceremonial footwashings and even shepherds are utterly foreign.   Beyond that, Dogrib is an irregular language that was never written before Mr. Zimmerman and his wife, Judy, tackled it.  ''It's a challenge,'' said Mr. Zimmerman, a 50-year-old native of Moline, Ill., who has been at the job since 1964. So far he has finished the Book of Mark and 10 percent of Luke and John. He calculates that he will need eight more years to complete the New Testament and parts of the Old. ''It's like a roller coaster,'' he said.  ''It's slow getting up that ramp, learning the language and preparing to translate. But then, coming down, things pick up considerably.''"

Securities dealers said that signs of a stronger than expected economy had made investors more reluctant to buy bonds. Scant demand for longer term issues has been especially apparent since the Treasury sold $2.75 billion of 13 percent, 10-year notes and $2.25 billion of 12 3/4 percent, 30-year bonds early this month.   ''Dealers still own a lot of those issues,'' one trader explained, ''while many investors are on the sidelines.''

It is widely predicted in airline circles in Texas in New York that the new management team will be more cautious than Mr. Lawrence was and that it will try hard to placate the creditors to whom the carrier owes more than $600 million in long-term debt.   But some industry informants cautioned that, given the parlous state of the money-losing airline, things might not go as expected.  Braniff's vice president for public relations, Jere Cox, declined to comment on the reports and predictions. Asked whether the airline would survive, he said: ''Why would you even raise such a question?  The entire attention of the airline is focused on a return to profitability.''"

Recent reports on Soviet nuclear activities, the vulnerability of the present American land-based missile system, and the scope and intensity of a debate over the MX missiles all underline the need for an early determination.   Air Force officers familiar with the program believe that Mr.  Reagan, after reviewing the claims of competing sea-based and landdeployed systems and, perhaps, ordering some adjustments of the present MX program, will approve the system.   One reason for their belief is the contention that none of the other systems advocated by opponents of the MX, such as sea-launched or land-based mobile missiles, offers the Soviet Union the prospect of verifying American strategic weaponry by space satellites or other means.   Verification by such means is one of the foundations of the strategic arms limitation treaties. The Soviet Union has rejected onsite inspection of its nuclear weapons, and it is considered highly unlikely that any American administration would permit Soviet on-site inspection without reciprocal rights."

The arms, if the rebels could obtain them, would help them against the expansion and rearmament of the Soviet helicopter formations. But even if Pakistan, the obvious base for an arms delivery program, was willing to allow weapons to pass its frontiers - which could invite Russian retaliation - the difficulties would be serious.   In the last four months the Soviet forces have ''seeded'' the mountain tracks leading into Afghanistan with small antipersonnel mines camouflaged to be indistinguishable from lumps of earth or small rocks."

''Kaile'' stands for two ideograms, one meaning ''business success'' and the other ''customer's delight,'' according to the manager, Chen Daoping. The long word that follows it means ''Westernfood restaurant.''

Since the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the Federal ''trustbusters'' were viewed as tribunes of society, preserving some strain of Jeffersonian populism in America, protecting the little guy from the predations of Big Business. Accordingly, antitrust actions were vote-getters, frequently begun just before elections.   But today, antitrust is under attack, not only from its traditional critics in the business community but also from scores of influential economists and lawyers -many of whom were once ardent antitrust advocates. A few even argue that the antitrust laws should be scrapped altogether.   ''Realistically, the Reagan Administration can only focus its deregulation efforts in one or two key areas,'' says Lester C.  Thurow, a liberal economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''If I had to choose one, I'd get rid of antitrust.''"

His economists are forecasting a slow recovery this year, with the real gross national product advancing only 1.1 percent, consumer prices climbing 11.1 percent and unemployment averaging 7.8 percent (compared with 7.4 percent in January).   Those figures are roughly in line with the consensus forecast of private economists for 1981. The ''Blue Chip'' consensus of 42 private economic forecasting units, regularly assembled by Eggert Econometric Enterprises of Sedonia, Ariz., shows a gain of ninetenths of 1 percent in real G.N.P. for this year, an inflation rate of 11.4 percent in the Consumer Price Index and an unemployment rate of 7.8 percent in the year's final quarter."

Some members of Congress, lawyers for many of the more than 350 companies and individuals that have sued Iran, and publications as diverse as The Wall Street Journal and The New Republic have asserted that President Reagan could and perhaps should renounce as extortionate and illegal all or part of the dollars-for-hostages deal negotiated with Iran by the Carter Administration through Algerian intermediaries.   Several claimants have gone to court to challenge the constitutionality of efforts to transfer out of the country Iranian assets against which they have filed claims and to terminate their lawsuits in favor of the international arbitration provided in the agreements. Appeals From Carter Aides   On the other hand, several former senior officials of the Carter Administration have urged their successors to scrupulously enforce the agreements, which they say are highly favorable to the United States and to Americans with commercial claims against Iran.   President Reagan, at his first news conference, said yesterday that ''I think that the United States will honor the obligations'' under the accords, but he said Administration lawyers had not yet determined ''whether they are in keeping with international and national or our own laws.''"

Its indictment contains the following elements: managers are obsessed with short-term profits, ignoring long-range investments; the entrepreneurial spirit seems scarce among executives; top positions are often filled with financial types, who have little hands-on experience with the businesses they oversee; managers have not focused enough on overseas markets, and business schools are a seedbed for these deficiencies.   The General Electric Company is often held up as an example of a corporation that has avoided these shortcomings. Its chairman, Reginald H.

The main threat to the country's stability comes from an economic crisis provoked by high oil prices and low coffee prices beyond its borders. But two recent terrorist bombings here, in which three United States Marine guards were injured and the Honduran Embassy was damaged, also announced the arrival of Central America's political problems in Costa Rica.   ''The boat is ours to steer,'' President Rodrigo Carazo Odio said in an interview, ''but the storm is all around us and the water is rough.''   In reality, the ''boat'' still seems strong. Although the Carazo administration is unpopular and economic hardship is growing, the majority of Costa Ricans, including leftists and conservatives, recognize that the democratic system installed here 33 years ago has brought them a tranquillity and welfare that are the envy of the rest of the region."

The officials said that Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the budget director, David A.  Stockman, jointly concluded that basing budget projections on a far more optimistic forecast for the economy, one prepared by the Claremont Economic Institute, a group of ''supply-side'' consultants, would divert attention from the projections to whether the forecast was realistic.   The debate and decision over which numbers to use illustrated anew the tensions within the Reagan Administration between two groups of economic advisers. One, the ''supply-siders,'' is convinced that the Reagan program of budget and tax cuts will lead to dramatic improvement in the economy. The other, a more traditional group, is less optimistic and believes in more restraint in public pronouncements about the economic outlook."

Minister of Justice Jean Chretien presented the amendments last night to a special joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate that has been considering the constitutional proposals since November and that is scheduled to report next month. Mr. Chretien said the Government ''has listened to the views of Canadians'' in modifying its initial proposals, but he made it clear that it was not yielding on basic policy.   In the absence of overall agreement between Ottawa and the 10 provinces, the Government's policy has been to proceed on its own with a plan to recover the Canadian Constitution from the control of the British Parliament, where it exists in the form of the British North America Act of 1867. But before transforming it into the Canada Act, with all future changes to be made in Canada, Britain is being asked to add a few last amendments, including a bill of rights and a way of amending the Constitution in the future."

But those hopes seemed dashed last week when the company went to the Government asking for a $200 million increase in its borrowing power simply to get through to the end of its fiscal year on March 31.   Just how a company that showed pretax profits of $132 million last year could run up pretax losses that are expected to exceed $240 million this year is partly the story of the European airline industry.   On the theory that national airlines tend to reflect the best and worst characteristics of their country's personalities, British Airways' woes parallel those of the British economy, which is experiencing the worst recession since World War II, high fuel costs, low productivity and the high cost of sterling. The carrier's fuel bill, for example, will rise this year to more than $1.2 billion from $991 million in 1980, despite a 6 percent decrease in passenger and freight traffic."

The very concept of the so-called broker-loan rate is being challenged as a result of the changes in the pricing structure, bankers say. The move is also giving larger securities firms a further advantage over their smaller competitors, which are not eligible for the cut-rate loans.   The interest rates that brokerage houses charge their customers to finance the purchase of securities on credit are tied to the brokerloan rate. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, for example, brokerage firms are required to charge their customers at least one-half percentage point more than the broker-loan rate on their margin accounts."

The estimated dollar level of Soviet spending represents what it would cost annually, using American prices and wages, to operate a military force of the same size and with the same weapons inventory as that of the Soviet Union.    Some Government agencies criticize this method of calculating Soviet military costs on the ground that wage levels and the Soviet Union's basic industrial structure are completely unlike those in the United States and also because the Russians pay for arms in rubles, not dollars."

That formula has turned sour, however, and O.P.M. now stands accused of a $100 million swindle in which it allegedly used bogus leases and false bills of sale to obtain loans. The company is being investigated by the United States Attorney in Manhattan and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.   Its bankruptcy has left a blue-ribbon list of creditors, including some of the nation's most prominent corporations and most prestigious lending institutions.

The statement by the permanent commission of the Spanish Episcopal Conference was widely interpreted as an attempt to influence the course of debate at the second congress of the Union of the Democratic Center, opening today on the island of Majorca.   The document, issued Wednesday, also indicated growing willingness among Spanish bishops to involve themselves in partisan politics amid signs that the Government party, split by the recent resignation of Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez, is shifting to the right. One apparent aim of the church is to prevent Justice Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the liberal author of the draft bill, already approved in committee, from retaining his post.

Three basic reasons for expecting lower interest rates are a promised reduction of inflation through cuts in Federal taxes and spending, an economic downturn that will reduce credit demands and inflation and a slowdown in the growth of the money supply that will relieve the Federal Reserve of the need to keep short-term rates so high.   The Reagan administration's plans to cut taxes and spending are the subject of much speculation in the credit markets. Since midDecember, optimism has prevailed, and the decline in interest rates was fueled partly by hopes that the rate of inflation would begin to decline under the incoming administration."

The United States hoped last summer that the increase in the military budget would be far higher - at least 11 percent - but those hopes were dashed as the press turned strongly against higher spending in the late autumn.   The $12 billion that Japan has budgeted for the coming fiscal year will still make it by far the largest military spender in Asia outside China, and Japanese officials believe that the groundwork has been laid for considerable increases later in the 1980's.   ''The security relationship between Japan and the United states has never been so good as at present,'' said Minoru Tamba, a Foreign Ministry official concerned with United States-Japanese military affairs. ''It should be stressed that the defense budget request has never been given such special attention since the end of World War II and that this stance is of epoch-making importance.''"

As Secretary of State Alexander M.

Lawrence A. Pezzullo, the American Ambassador to Nicaragua, informed the Sandinist Government in Managua that further disbursements of economic aid would be suspended until it was decided that the Nicaraguan Government was not giving aid to El Salvador's guerrillas.

Some industry analysts said the unusually detailed disclosure of long-range plans served Delta's interests by underscoring a public image of financial strength at a time when less profitable airlines have had to delay equipment-purchasing decisions.   Delta's $7 billion in purchases would be in addition to the $3 billion worth of Boeing 757's that the airline decided to order last year, a Delta official said.   From Delta headquarters in Atlanta, William Berry, chief spokesman for the airline, said the company hoped that the Boeing Company, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and Airbus - a European manufacturing consortium - would compete for $5 billion worth of the new orders, which are to be for a total of about 100 short-range, 150-passenger aircraft of a design that is still unselected. He said Delta had already been in touch with all three concerns about the planes. The remaining $2 billion is to go for roughly 40 more Boeing 757's."

Savarin's ground-roast brand in this market is second only to Maxwell House, thanks mainly to aggressive promotion deals that absorbed most of the money that formerly went to advertising."

Moreover, the ruling Parti Quebecois, which pushed through legislation allowing the expropriation three years ago, faces doubtful prospects for re-election."

By the time the drama came to an end the United Nations had disappeared from the stage.   An ABC-TV documentary program asserts that the Secretary General, Kurt Waldheim, undermined the negotiations because he was too soft and the inquiry panel he formed was equally destructive because it was too harsh.   The ABC report, called ''America Held Hostage,'' also includes several details of other efforts to win freedom for the hostages:   - The United States reportedly agreed to the arrest of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi by the Panamanian authorities in May 1980, shortly before he left Panama for Egypt.

But Detroit is moving to revive the production of convertibles, at least in a limited fashion.  Although Government safety rules were often blamed for the convertible's demise, auto makers say the real culprits were airconditioning, sun roofs and high-speed freeways. Early advertisements for convertibles said they were ''built for the lass whose face is brown with the sun,'' but modern drivers seemed to prefer the cold comfort of climate control to the glamour of top-down motoring."

And the spring new-model introduction is beginning to rival the fall release as domestic and foreign manufacturers rush new products to market.   This spring will see an entirely new line of cars from the General Motors Corporation that will compete directly with the subcompact sedans that have made the Japanese the second most powerful force in the American automobile market.

Several dozen of its diplomats and servicemen were held captive for more than a year in a far-away land by a seemingly irrational mob led by an aged Islamic ascetic, and Americans, from President Carter on down, were powerless to act.   The President tried pleading, tried bargaining, tried threatening and, in one instance, tried attacking, but it was all in vain.  Congress passed a law exempting the hostages from paying income taxes but could do no more. Individual citizens, equally frustrated and eager to make some gesture of support, recalled a once-popular song about a convict coming home and tied yellow ribbons around the trees in their front yards.

Under Frank Borman, its ex-astronaut president, chairman and chief executive, Eastern itself has been competing vigorously: last year it announced low fares to gain passengers in the New York-toCalifornia market -and spurred a price war.   This month it has moved to protect its Air Shuttle and generate transcontinental business by giving shuttle passengers coupons good for flights to California at half price. And Eastern is considering a merger with debt-ridden Braniff International, which could give it a leg up on Latin American routes, where Braniff has been strong.   But Eastern's overall performance has been ''disappointing,'' Mr.  Borman conceded, solemn-faced, in an interview yesterday.  For the first nine months of 1980, the airline lost $35 million, compared with earnings of $42 million in the 1979 period. The red ink included an operating loss of $5 million, on operating revenues of $2.56 billion, and reflected the heavy cost of financing equipment.

Business wants faster depreciation writeoffs - that is, deductions from taxable income - for the cost of the equipment, vehicles and buildings that comprise its productive assets.   Everyone, from the multibillion-dollar corporate members of the Business Roundtable to the tens of thousands of Chamber of Commerce members that employ fewer than 100 people each, is crying for it.  Business also would like cuts in the capital gains tax and in corporate income taxes, but depreciation is the top priority.   That, anyway, is what Congress is being told by the salaried Washington representatives of the Roundtable, the Chamber, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Businesses -groups that sometimes have conflicting tax goals."

That, at least, is the contention of many respected observers of management practices, including Reginald H. Jones, chairman of the General Electric Company, and Peter F.

Their indictment springs from what these critics say is the seemingly irrational fondness corporate managements display for the FIFO method of inventory accounting in the current inflationary period.   Under FIFO, or the first-in, first-out assumption, reported earnings are higher, but so is taxable income, and therefore, tax payments. Using the alternate method, LIFO, the last-in, first-out assumption, reported earnings are lower, but taxes are, too."

In fact, Mr. Brown has already earned high marks for changing the posture of the telephone company.

As a result, some are revising inflation forecasts in a novel direction - downward. Luck and a continuation of tight monetary policies are primarily responsible for the new optimism. A mild winter has kept food prices under control. The war between Iran and Iraq did not deal a serious blow to petroleum supplies, as initially feared. And high interest rates have dampened demand for credit throughout the economy. In spite of the improved outlook, upheaval in the Middle East or a spell of dry weather at the wrong time could easily upset current projections. As of now, Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University, thinks an end to auto rebates and an increase in postage rates will offset the antiinflationary effect of slower growth in the second quarter, leaving prices one percentage point higher than the first quarter average rate of 11.5 percent. After that, Mr. Ratajczak expects inflation to slow appreciably. Canadian Gas Prices Flare Up   There is little relief from rising energy prices, it seems.  Consumers in the Northwest, Midwest and California are apt to see their natural gas bills go up this week, as import prices of Canadian natural gas are scheduled to rise from the current $4.47 per thousand cubic feet to $4.94, well above the third quarter average price of $3.18 charged by domestic producers in the U.S."

''We always used to talk about the U.S. being less trade-oriented than other countries, but that has changed markedly in recent years,'' says Helen B. Junz, an international economist at Townsend-Greenspan & Company, an economics consulting firm. ''American industry is more and more dependent on exports for its business.''   A flood of goods bearing the stamp ''Made in U.S.A.'' is streaming abroad in ever-greater volume - Boeing jets, General Electric gas turbines, Caterpillar tractors, Marlboro cigarettes, grain and animal feeds, electronics gear, films.   To be sure, exports still do not loom as large in the American economy as they do for such vaunted traders as West Germany and Japan. Merchandise exports amount to about 8 1/2 percent of the United States gross national product, the broadest gauge of economic activity, including goods and services. By contrast, the export contribution to Japan's gross national product is almost 13 percent, economists estimate, and more than 23 percent for West Germany. In 1980, for instance, Japan showed net manufactured exports alone of $92 billion, more than three times the United States figure."

The first thing it did was to commission a Gallup survey to see about consumer attitudes toward advertising.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Lester C. Thurow conceived from his pile of statistics the idea that having babies is why women are paid less than men.   The solution, says Professor Thurow, is to swell her womb before she is 25, or after her 35th birthday, thus enabling her to participate in that Dynamic Decade of Distillation when promotable human substances are discerned and rewarded. The only alternative to this, he says, is for ''society'' (and we know which sex he means) to allow ''a longer period of time in which both men and women can attempt to successfully enter the labor force.''"

In a series of interviews, the officials said that the lack of improvement in the prospects for curbing inflation had renewed their conviction that the Federal Reserve should maintain a tight monetary policy in the absence of a dramatic shift in the economic outlook.  The officials, however, said they did not see any signs of a sharp decline in economic activity.   Moreover, the officials are concerned that President-elect Ronald Reagan's plan to cut spending and taxes simultaneously may fail, resulting in still-larger budget deficits and inflationary pressures.

One of the reasons he opened in New York was to insure that he would be keeping two clients, Suntory, the Japanese distiller, and Fotomat Video. So he has started right off with $10 million in billings - that's his estimate.   Secondly, he believes in advertising his agency, something few of his competitors on either coast bother to do.

Weinberger has sounded a constant alarm about ''aggressive Soviet activity around the world'' as he has sought to justify the Reagan Administration's proposals for higher military spending.   At the same time, Mr. Weinberger has renewed the contention that the United States could not, and would not, bear by itself the burden for the common defense of the non-Communist industrial nations. ''It is essential,'' he has said repeatedly, ''that we develop a more rational 'division of labor,' under which our NATO allies and Japan will be asked to join us in contributing more to the common defense.''   Critical to the Administration's plan is the attitude of West Germany and the Japan, an irony not lost on those who lived through World War II. The United States, which once planned to reduce Germany and Japan to pastoral nations, now wants them to assume a responsibility second only to America's for the collective security of the non-Communist industrialized world."

The U.S.  Electricar Corporation says it can, but anyone who reads the company's prospectus filed prior to its public offering last spring might argue no.

In the fiscal third quarter ended Nov. 30, a period of peak production, Electricar turned out only 40 cars, enough to produce a profit for the quarter. They were all presold, but the automobile market consists of 8 million to 10 million units, so that output is not even a drop in the bucket."

About 20,000 demonstrators encircled the site, according to police estimates, and groups of hundreds of demonstrators armed with gasoline bombs, sticks, stones and high-powered slingshots fought for hours with police units armed with water cannons and tear gas.   The protest took place despite a Government ban on demonstrations and a series of court decisions that reversed and then upheld the ban.   The violent demonstration, the most recent in a series of clashes between the police and demonstrators over nuclear power, poses a serious political problem for Chancellor Helmut Schmidt."

The higher sales, an increase of 5 percent over 1979, were made despite a record 5 percent slump in passenger traffic on United States airlines, and despite stagnating passenger traffic on international flights of airlines belonging to the International Air Transport Association, or I.A.T.A.   The sales volume was reported this week by Robert M. Held, who is president of Inflight Food Services Association Inc., which is the main industry body. He said in an interview that the increase reflected higher prices and also changes in airline operations.   Under the heightened competitive climate created by the Airline Deregulation Act, some carriers have begun flying additional flights that require added food and beverage service, Mr. Held reported, and some, such as New York Air, have been emphasizing inflight amenities for competitive reasons. But airlines have also dropped flights and cut back on food service on others."

These measures are the first in what is expected to be a concerted effort by Western nations to help Poland's economy, which is suffering from the labor unrest of recent months. Western European countries, particularly West Germany, are leading the aid program because of their heavy financial commitments to Poland and the fear that a further deterioration of the Polish economy would lead to intervention by the Soviet Union that would jeopardize what remains of East-West cooperation."

There is little controversy over the principle that there should be a gradual reduction of money and credit growth until the money supply rises with real output. But differences are expected to arise over implementation: the degree to which, over the short term, the Fed will stick to its targets of reduced growth in the money supply.   Behind the differences are varying perceptions of what the slowing of monetary growth can do, by itself, for the inflation problem.  ''The Reagan budget is not inflationary if the Fed sticks to its monetary targets, and we intend to encourage them to do so,'' says Baryl W. Sprinkel, who has been designated Under Secretary of the Treasury for monetary affairs, the chief Fed-watcher in the Administration."

Even after the latest week's gain, only slightly larger than many economists projected, M-1B has grown at a slow 1.3 percent annual rate for the latest quarter, well within the Fed's 1981 growth targets, although many analysts expect that the current 10 percent inflation rate insures that money supply growth will accelerate as the year progresses.

Even though candidate Reagan campaigned on a platform calling for immediate decontrol of natural gas prices, it is becoming more and more likely that President Reagan will not ask Congress to vote on the issue.  Instead, he will probably embark on what some have called ''the backdoor approach'' to decontrol, an approach that requires no legislated change in the current law, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.   Through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which administers the gas act, the Administration can raise the average price for all gas by allowing dramatic increases in the price for certain categories of gas. It was precisely this path that David Stockman laid out to a gas industry meeting before he became director of the Office of Management and Budget."

By enrolling the poor in prepaid medical groups, the Massachusetts plan is meant to rein in the cost of the program, which has defied control because the law requires states to reimburse doctors and hospitals for all covered services no matter where given and with no overall limit.   Because the proposal is not permitted under current law, top Massachusetts officials were in Washington this week asking the Reagan Administration for a waiver to try it as an experiment.   If it goes ahead, the plan will be closely watched by other states. Despite efforts to hold down costs, unanticipated Medicaid expenses are helping to break the budgets of about two-thirds of the states, including New York. Since 1967, costs have swelled nationally from $1.9 billion to $21.7 billion, of which just over half is paid by Washington."

They'll wonder whether, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has promised, there will really be anything in it for them.   The revolutionary flying machine already offers some promise to a few industries: Aerospace companies, led by the Rockwell International Corporation, the prime shuttle contractor, hope to supply shuttle hardware for the rest of the century. And the communications and data-transmission industry is depending on the reusable shuttles to launch its satellites more cheaply than the conventional rockets now being used.   But in the view of NASA, the shuttle system holds far greater potential. Despite technical problems that have delayed the launch and the last week's accident - unrelated to the shuttle's operation - that left one technician dead, NASA sees a day when dozens of shuttles will be commuting to and from earth carrying enormous payloads. Crews aboard the shuttles could build and maintain gigantic orbiting communications satellites, solar-power stations that would transmit electricity to earth, and highly automated factories where industry could use the unique environment of space to make things that cannot be made as well, if at all, on earth."

Westinghouse not only survived, it emerged last year with most of its legal entanglements settled. Its newly slimmed-down operations generated record sales of $8.5 billion and record profits of $402.9 million.

Over short periods of time, money supply changes are notoriously volatile and have little connection with the course of the economy and interest rates. However, when viewed over longer periods, some analysts say, the latest Fed data show that money-supply growth has been modest and could be pointing toward a slowing of the economy, less inflation and lower interest rates later this year.   Traders in the credit markets, where short- and long-term interest rates declined after the Fed's announcement, quickly interpreted the money supply decline to mean that the Fed was unlikely to raise short-term interest rates in the near future."

''The Fed has thrown some cold water on the 'peak fever' that raged through credit markets two weeks ago'' by preventing a decline in the Federal funds rate, analysts at Mabon, Nugent & Company said. Some long-term bonds rose as much as 13 points, or $130 per bond, from Dec. 11 to Jan. 5 but have declined almost five points since then.   While a decline in short-term rates is awaited, secondary market trading in bonds has been volatile. Yesterday, after 12 3/4 percent Treasury bonds traded as high as 106 18/32 before closing at 105 10/32 offered, one government securities specialist said, ''I'm tired of riding this roller coaster.''"

Tonight United States and British financial officials were still striving to reach an understanding with Iran that would resolve the hostage issue without upsetting financial markets. They were working to avoid having the Iranians promptly sell off billions of dollars in an effort to protect the money they recover against further freezes or court-ordered attachments.   A key problem in this effort, sources say, is to convince Iran's intensely suspicious leadership that any financial deal that guarantees the return of some of their blocked assets in return for the hostages' freedom will not be immediately reversed when the captured American diplomats are safely out of Iranian hands."

When it was remarked that it seemed a short time for so momentous a change, Mr. Young thought for a moment and replied, ''It's not so short.''   Eight years earlier the pendulum had swung the other way. Then the new Nixon Administration decided that American policies in southern Africa had been compromised by misdirected idealism and it decided, in a secret policy memorandum, to ease the political and economic isolation of the white regime while maintaining a public stance of opposition to repressive policies.   In recent weeks the question of whether the advent of the Reagan Administration will prompt yet another abrupt change in course has preoccupied white and black leaders here, not only because that history is fairly well known but also because scattered public statements by the new President and key advisers would seem to point to a policy in which first concern about racial questions gives way to first concern about the expansion of Soviet influence."

Ross Perot, the Texas computer millionaire who once dispatched a paramilitary team to free two of his employees from an Iranian prison, is now bringing a vigorous legal challenge to the agreements that led to Iran's release of the 52 American hostages.   Mr. Perot's Dallas-based computer services company, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, is seeking a court order to bar the United States from ''taking any action to nullify, interfere with, or abrogate'' either the $19 million judgment it won against Iran for breach of contract, or the order it obtained attaching Iranian funds to satisfy that judgment.   If Mr. Perot wins, it is possible that the court could broadly invalidate parts of the agreement with Iran on constitutional grounds. It is also possible, however, that a narrower ruling in his favor could simply conclude that the agreement, legal or not, does not apply to his company's unique position."

United States officials said the Japanese could make a significant contribution to the common defense of northeast Asia if they would acquire the naval and air power, the modern equipment and the logistical support to accomplish that mission.   The objective, if a conflict should break out, would be to clear the skies of Soviet aircraft and to bottle up the Soviet surface and submarine fleet based across the Sea of Japan in Vladivostok. It is estimated that there are 100 bombers, 80 surface combatants and 80 submarines stationed there."

''He likes to see himself, not as an author, but as a publicly subsidized payload of sensitive instruments that records information irrespective of personal values.''   Certainly that was how he appeared to a shocked and intrigued literary world in the 1960's, in books that attacked the very idea of books, as if he were a blameless guru through whom the spirit of the electromagnetic spectrum - the spirit of ''haptic harmony'' and ''tribal wholeness'' and ''synesthesia'' - spoke in puns and gnomic riddles."

Sales of durable goods and men's wear, both of which have been erratic, will likely benefit the most from the improvement in the second half, according to speakers at the 70th annual convention of the National Retail Merchants Association.   Appearing on an economic panel that opened the three-day meeting, Robert A. Mooney, corporate economics manager for the J.C. Penney Company, predicted that in the second half a combination of rising income, lower inflation and a tax cut would spur consumer spending."

Senators said that they had been assured at a briefing today that there were no plans to increase the number of advisers being sent to El Salvador beyond the 54 already announced, including the members of the Special Forces, who are known as Green Berets. Senior officials also said at a Senate briefing that the Administration, acting to help El Salvador economically, would request an additional $60 million for assistance in this fiscal year, according to Senate sources.   The Administration plans to seek $80 million to $100 million in economic aid for El Salvador in the next fiscal year. This is roughly $100 million less than the aid requested by President Jose Napoleon Duarte. Officials stressed, however, that the economic aid was three times greater than the military help."

Regan's testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee this week delighted the supply-siders, who can now hail him as one of their own. Mr. Regan said tax cuts ''can't wait until budget outlays are reduced.'' The tax cuts were essential to stimulate economic growth, which would help increase Government revenues and reduce Federal borrowing.   Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, cautiously demurred, saying he would like to see ''concrete actions on spending cuts before a final decision is taken on a tax program.'' But now that Secretary Regan has come around to the supply side, all the pieces in President Reagan's economic plan are falling into place."

But he remains a vivid presence in Leningrad and the Soviet Union, a presence that has never given comfort to the Kremlin.    Although his masterpieces - ''Crime and Punishment,'' ''The Idiot,'' ''The Brothers Karamazov'' - helped to shape the 20thcentury novel in the West, he has never been taken as a model by the practitioners of socialist realism. For Mann, for Gide, for Kafka he was the father of the psychological novel; for Soviet literary critics of the 1940's and 1950's he was too morbid, too religious, too conservative."

Haig Jr. will bring flexibility, nuance and coherence to the management of   American foreign policy.  But remarks from the new Administration in Washington have already modified this optimism without fatally damaging it.  Several European leaders have questioned whether harsh remarks by Mr. Reagan and Mr. Haig in their first few weeks in office about the Soviet Union can serve a constructive purpose. Others were struck by the apparent lack of coordination and sensitivity to the internal political problems of some allies that permitted Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger to reopen discussion on stationing neutron weapons in Europe. Allies Are Now More Watchful   Although Mr. Haig sought to smooth out the neutron weapons issue, the result is a more watchful attitude toward the Administration.  Interviews with policy makers in six member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the months leading up to the inauguration reflected a generalized hope that Mr. Reagan would bring more firmness to American policy while dropping his intense antiSoviet attitudes and his commitment to return the United States to a position of military superiority."

In a series of interviews, some Chrysler dealers said that ''K'' car sales had picked up so much that they were ordering cars from Chrysler to replenish inventories. Other dealers said they were even expanding their inventories, which had been kept at a low level because of high interest rates.

Those tea leaves are still in use, and always will be, but today the conclusions drawn from them are often overshadowed by a more subjective kind of analysis concerned with inflationary expectations: The rate of predicted inflation determines today's bond yields, the thinking goes, since bond buyers are supposed to demand a nominal interest rate that equals inflation rates over the life of the bond, plus some real interest return.   ''A coming change in rates can not be determined by analysis of sources and uses of funds,'' explains Alan Greenspan, an economic adviser to President Reagan. ''Interest rates will be moved as the inflation premium is adjusted.''"

Brezhnev's address today to the 26th Soviet Communist Party Congress, as translated by Tass, the official press agency:   On the international plane, the period under review has been rough and complicated, marked above all by an intensive struggle of two lines in world affairs: the line of bridling the arms race, strengthening peace and detente and defending the sovereign rights and freedom of nations, on the one hand, and, on the other, the line of disrupting detente, escalating the arms race, of threats and interference in other countries' affairs and of suppressing the liberation struggle.   The sphere of imperialist domination has narrowed. The internal contradictions in capitalist countries and the rivalry between them have grown sharper. The aggressiveness of imperialist policy, notably that of U.S. imperialism, has increased acutely.   When thunderclouds gathered on the international horizon by the beginning of the 80's, the Soviet Union continued to persevere in efforts to remove the threat of war and to preserve and deepen detente and acted to expand mutually beneficial cooperation with most countries of the world."

The financings are part of a record $35.9 billion of new cash that Treasury officials say they must borrow in the first three months of this year. The Government's need to borrow is a direct result of the Federal budget deficit, which analysts say is growing as the economy weakens. By the second quarter, a period when income-tax receipts traditionally help reduce Government borrowings, Treasury officials expect to borrow only an additional $2 billion to $5 billion."

Former President Gerald R. Ford, in China this week as an envoy of President Reagan, said today that after extended talks with Chinese leaders he was ''absolutely convinced'' and ''absolutely confident'' that differences between China and the United States could and would be resolved as relations are ''expanded in depth and breadth.''   Chinese Government officials said that Mr. Ford's talks Monday with Deng Xiaoping, China's principal leader, and Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, and Mr. Reagan's meeting at the White House last week with the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Chai Zemin, had gone a long way toward erasing apprehensions that began to accumulate here last fall. This was when Mr. Reagan vowed as a Presidential candidate to upgrade unofficial relations with Taiwan in what seemed to be a flouting of the 1979 Chinese-American normalization accords."

Many key details, however, have fallen into place as the result of seizures of particularly informative documents from the guerrilla forces in November 1980 and on the eve of their failed ''general offensive'' of January 1981.  This mass of captured documents includes battle plans, letters and reports of meetings and travels, some written in cryptic language.   When deciphered and considered in conjunction with collateral intelligence evidence, the documents bring to light the chain of events leading to the January attempt by the Salvadoran armed left to oust the Government of El Salvador - a Government that has executed important reforms and has convoked a process leading to democratic elections in 1982.   This accumulated evidence reveals a highly disturbing pattern of parallel and coordinated action by a number of Communist and some radical countries seeking to impose a military solution in a small, third world nation. It is a pattern we have seen before - to be specific, in Angola and Ethiopia."

One such projection shows the nation's inflation rate dropping from more than 10 percent now to roughly 6.5 percent in 1982 and even lower, to possibly less than 5 percent, by the 1984 elections.   This is a faster improvement than most economists believe possible. The conventional view is that a policy of economic restraint might slow inflation by roughly one percentage point a year."

''We both place our faith not so much in economic theory but in the resourcefulness and decency of ordinary people.''   Welcoming the Prime Minister with a flourish of heraldic trumpets, the President echoed the sentiment that economic solutions ''lie within the people and not the state.'' His assistants took care in briefings, however, to caution that the Reagan budget plan should not be too closely identified with the Thatcher plan in Britain, where a tax cut was followed by worsening inflation and an economic slowdown."

Under that policy, Mr. Reagan asserted today in the kind of tough but unspecific language that characterized his campaign speeches, terrorists can no longer go to sleep in the confidence that the United States will not strike at them."

The author presents statistical data showing that operating subsidies for commuter rail average $1.53 per trip, while subway subsidies averaged only $0.41 per trip. This is discriminatory, in his opinion, because some 38 percent of commuter passengers earn over $25,000 per year, while only 13 percent of subway passengers are in this higher income (and tax) category. (He neglected to note that a higher percentage of subway passengers have to stand while riding - still further evidence of discrimination.)"

They quake at the prospect of having to resurrect a year's finances and are haunted by visions of steely-eyed tax agents pronouncing sentence.   Although most audits are civil matters, they have similarities to criminal trials. For one thing, an audit - like a court trial, is essentially an adversary proceeding. But unlike a trial, where the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty, the burden of proof in an audit rests with the taxpayer. It is the taxpayer who has the responsibility of demonstrating that the proper tax has been paid."
