Work will begin early next year in the West Mogotlorsk field, according to the company, and will involve the drilling of about 50 wells. The project will use Russian drilling rigs and American technology, according to Robert Harper, a spokesman for Pennzoil, which is in Houston."

He says Camp David taught him patience. It didn't prepare him to be a couch diplomat.   Mr. Rubinstein, a man with a wry sense of humor, says that what will be recalled most about the inconclusive round of Middle East peace talks that ended Wednesday night in Washington will be a sofa."

In part, the turnabout resulted from vigorous arm-twisting by the Bush Administration and the banking lobby. But it came primarily from the fear of some Democrats, who at first saw the bill as a good way to embarrass President Bush, that they would be blamed for a fall in the market."

The series of short-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board has had only a neglible effect in reversing the downturn.

In their view, much deeper cuts in the overnight Federal funds rate are needed to stimulate the economy."

The freeze, imposed on Sunday, suggests that Kevin Maxwell, who is 32 years old and had the leading role in running the Maxwell empire after his father's mysterious death, is under greater suspicion than his older brother, Ian, of having moved assets out of employee pension funds and the two main public companies in the empire: the Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C. and the Maxwell Communication Corporation."

While jittery feelings are hardly a stranger to a country long used to living on the edge, many here say that such sentiments have reached an acute level not seen in a long time.

Mr. Peres proposed the creation of a demilitarized West Bank, with Israel retaining certain, unspecified areas for security purposes but yielding the rest to a new ""Jordanian-Palestinian confederation"" that would include the present Kingdom of Jordan. The crowded Gaza Strip would also be a part of this confederation, he said.    ""Peace cannot be achieved without territorial compromise,"" Mr. Peres, a former Prime Minister, said in an interview at his party's headquarters in which he reiterated his party's position on several issues. He said that one of the best ways to expedite the Middle East peace process being promoted by the United States was to freeze settlement activity in the territories.    On both counts -- land concessions and a halt to settlements -- the Labor Party leader is diametrically at odds with the no-compromise stand taken by the Government and the Likud party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.    ""When somebody says Gaza belongs to us, we are not convinced,"" Mr. Peres said. ""We think that we belong to Gaza more than Gaza belongs to us. We are more in a way the policemen of Gaza than its proprietor.    ""We would not like to dominate another people against their will,"" he continued. ""It's a moral issue. It's a political issue. Throughout our history as a Jewish people we have never dominated other people, and whoever dominated us disappeared from history. We don't want to copy that.""    Some opinion polls here suggest that a majority of Israelis share his views on a settlement freeze, and that their ranks include a significant share of Likud voters. But the surveys also suggest that agreement on this issue does not necessarily translate into broad popular support for Mr. Peres's party, which had belonged to a Shamir-led government until the coalition broke apart 19 months ago. Political commentators say Labor is now at a low ebb as it prepares for elections scheduled to be held within a year.    Rejecting this view, Mr. Peres said there will be many new voters in the next election, including a large number of Soviet immigrants. ""None of us knows how they'll vote,"" he said."

From the late 70's through the early 80's, the Triumph Company seemed a terminal case, kept barely alive by a workers' cooperative that was determined to keep making bikes even though Japanese companies had pretty well won their customers. By 1983 even the workers gave up, and John Bloor, a British millionaire, bought Triumph from its liquidators.    Now the Triumph is coming back. Mr. Bloor, who apparently saw more value in the Triumph name than in the design, spent seven years engineering a secretive recovery for the company. He built automated facilities, re-staffed and commissioned new motorcycle designs.

If only America could rekindle the productivity flame, they say, every burger-flipper would soon take home a living wage and every poor child would have a place in Head Start. Cities would no longer be forced to choose between filling the potholes and keeping the local felons at bay. Even Uncle Sam would be able to pay his debts."

The idea is to put off paying taxes on the deferred income -- and what it can earn -- so that more can be saved for retirement or some other point down the road.  The most common type of salary deferral is the 401(k) plan. A 401(k) is a tax-qualified plan, which means that the employer gets an immediate tax deduction, as it does on any wages, for all money contributed to it. In most cases, the decision to invest in a 401(k) is pretty straightforward. Typically, the company matches some portion of the employee's contribution. And the money belongs to you; it is set aside in a trust that cannot be tapped by anyone but you."

The General Motors Corporation lost $1.1 billion and the Ford Motor Company lost $574.4 million in the third quarter. The Chrysler Corporation reports earnings this week and big losses are expected. Sales are down for Japanese auto makers, but most are still showing profits. ""Don't blame this on Bob Stempel,"" said James Womack, co-author of ""The Machine That Changed the World."" Mr. Stempel is G.M.'s chairman. The problem, Mr. Womack says, is that as companies move to newer production techniques they are more vulnerable to the economy's ups and downs. The Japanese manage their economy better, he said, so their companies do better. ""Lean production can't function in the extreme cyclicality that is normal in this country,"" he said. What will turn things around? ""I can't see a way out without the Government stepping in. It's starting to happen with mini-vans.""  Bad Timing for F.D.I.C. Chief  William Taylor took over as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last week. He may wish he hadn't. Just after his confirmation, the F.D.I.C. told Congress it was tripling its estimate of how much money it will need next year to protect the nation's bank deposits. Instead of a ""mere"" $3 billion, the F.D.I.C. said it will require $9.6 billion. In 1993, it will need $8.7 billion more. The F.D.I.C. estimates that more than 200 banks will fail next year with assets of about $86 billion. But the estimates assume the economy will grow at about 3.5 percent, which is unlikely. If it continues to limp along the fund could require as much as $28.9 billion over the next two years, the F.D.I.C. said. That casts a pall over the Administration's proposal to raise the F.D.I.C.'s credit line to $30 billion for two years. In a slow-growth economy -- with $28.9 billion needed -- there would be just $1.1 billion left to insure about $2.3 trillion of deposits -- not much of a safety net. It is now up to Mr. Taylor to mend that net. A Big-Ticket Surprise  Durable goods are big-ticket items like refrigerators and railroad cars. They are supposed to last at least three years (some actually do). These big items are an important engine for the economy. But according to the Commerce Department, sales of these goods took a 3.2 percent slide in September after falling 4.1 percent in August. Economists were surprised; the consensus was that orders for durables would increase by 1 percent. The Economy's Political Clout  After the coalition forces defeated Iraq in March, President Bush's popularity soared. But since then confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to manage the economy took the mother of all tumbles. According to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll released last week, 57 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is handling the economy. Sixty percent feel ""things"" have gotten ""pretty seriously off on the wrong track."" In January -- even as the gulf war loomed -- only 31 percent of all Americans thought so. The recent poll said 44 percent of Americans feel the country is in worse shape now than it was five years ago. With just 13 months left to the election, Mr. Bush had better hope the slow-growth economy has a quick rebound. The 'Beige Book' Looks Bleak  The Federal Reserve's ""beige book,"" released last week, was hardly a confidence builder. The book is a compilation of reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks. The book said the recovery had lost much of its oomph in September and early October. Retail sales were flat; factory output -- while improving -- was doing so at a laggardly pace. How will the Fed react to its own book? ""It will cut the discount rate by Thanksgiving to about 4.5 percent,"" said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Such a cut, he said, will drive money out of money-market accounts and into stocks.  A Whole New Telephone Game  The Federal Communications Commission proposed last week that local telephone companies be allowed to package and transmit video programs on their wires. With next-generation fiber-optics lines phone companies could offer a myriad of interactive services from entertainment libraries, recipe banks and educational programs, each tailored to a customer's needs. The $18 billion cable industry is likely to fight (unsuccessfully) against the ruling. ""Among the top two or three concerns of every cable operator has always been head-to-head competition against local telephone companies,"" said John Mansell, of Paul Kagan Associates, a research firm.  COMPANIES   End of an Era at Compaq  Legend has it Rod Canion wrote the business plan for the Compaq Computer Corporation on a napkin while seated in a Houston coffee shop. Six years after he founded Compaq, it was a $2 billion company dominating the portable-computer and I.B.M.-clone market and Mr. Canion was its chief executive. But though Compaq got off to a quick start in the 1980's, it has languished in the 1990's, losing market share to a new generation of clone makers. Early last week the company reported a loss of $70.3 million in the third quarter, its first ever, compared with a $123.6 million profit the year before. To cut costs, the company announced it would slash its work force by 1,400. Late in the week, Compaq raised the number to 1,401, when its board of directors relieved Mr. Canion of his job. Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's executive vice president, will take over. Chase's Impressive Showing  Chase Manhattan managed to turn in a third-quarter profit of $136 million. For a company that was near the brink due to a huge portfolio of bad real estate and foreign loans, the turnaround reported last week was impressive. Chase, which had $630 million in losses for the same period a year ago, embarked on a massive cost-cutting program last year. That program -- coupled with lower interest rates, which gave the bank larger spreads between what it pays for money and what it charges -- helped make the company profitable. ""Chase is turning itself around,"" said Thomas Hanley, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers.  Time Warner Inches Back  When Time Warner Inc. released its earnings reports last week, the big media company seemed to be limping its way back to health. True, Time Warner lost money -- $62 million in the third quarter -- but that was significantly less than the $91 million it lost in the comparable period the previous year. Revenue in the third quarter rose (somewhat) to $2.94 billion, from $2.90 billion a year ago. And some of the big media company's units, like the records group, showed genuine strength. Prodigy Can Do No Right  A year ago Prodigy Services Company, one of the largest electronic bulletin boards and information services, got into trouble for screening the subscribers' messages. Rights groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, said Prodigy had no business censoring those communications. Last week, Prodigy got into trouble for not censoring its subscribers' messages. The Anti-Defamation League, a division of B'nai B'rith, accused the information service of failing to prohibit anti-Semitic messages some subscribers were putting on the company's electronic bulletin boards. The organization said that since Prodigy advertised itself as a ""family service,"" it should keep certain messages off the screen. The A.C.L.U. disagreed. ""The way to answer speech is with speech,"" said Jerry Berman, director of the A.C.L.U.'s technology information project.  The Clifford Defense  When Clark M. Clifford testified before Congress about his involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commercial International last week, he told the same story he has told twice before. He was deceived by B.C.C.I., the bank accused of wrongdoings such as working with terrorists and laundering money for drug lords. But a former B.C.C.I. official, Abdur Sakhai, told the committee earlier that Mr. Clifford, a former Defense Secretary, and Robert A. Altman, his law partner, knew about B.C.C.I.'s ownership of First American Bancshares, the Washington bank for which Mr. Clifford served as chairman. Mr. Clifford denied the accusations. ""We have not violated any law,"" he said. ""We have not committed any impropriety."" Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, presented the witnesses with documents that he said seemed to tie them to B.C.C.I. and that suggested they knew who really owned First American. ""Totally untrue,"" Mr. Clifford said of the charges. Salomon Brothers Inc. estimated the profits it made from its illegal bidding in the Treasury securities market at between $17 million and $19.7 million. INTERNATIONAL   Snatching the Soviet Purse  Mikhail S. Gorbachev borrowed an idea from Alexander Hamilton last week. The Soviet President decreed that the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs would be the sole agency responsible for servicing the country's foreign debts. The decree was approved by leaders of 10 republics eager to rid themselves of debts. But like Hamilton, Mr. Gorbachev was not making an altruistic gesture. By taking responsibility for foreign credits, the central Government in Moscow will also be at the center of any future borrowing. As Hamilton knew, power rests with the purse.  A Car of One's Own, Literally  Unlike previous shows, the companies that mounted displays at the Tokyo auto show last week highlighted their smaller, sportier and -- yes -- more frugal entrants into the market. Some, like Mazda's HR-X, were powered by hydrogen. Others were electric. But some attending the show said the car everyone wanted to see was not displayed: Saturn, made by G.M. in Tennessee. The Saturn is called America's import fighter.  The General Strike That Wasn't  When strikes were common in Italy, Italians joked that only when the country's union leaders went out on strike did everything work. No more. Italy is a smoothly running, smoothly growing country that recently surpassed Britain in per capita income and has little labor unrest. So last week, when the unions called a four-hour general strike to protest the budget-cutting plans of Prime Minister Giulio Adreotti, they met with meager success. A lot of workers went out -- but not enough to stop the country. And when they did go out, they were just as apt to grab a long lunch as to take to the streets."

In the half-century since assuming the throne of the Angkor kings, Prince Sihanouk has not only outlasted the French -- he led Cambodia to independence from France in the early 1950's -- he has also somehow managed to survive a coup by rightists, years of imprisonment by maniacal leftists, a civil war and more than a decade in exile."

But the new policies, of reducing price supports and subsidizing exports, have devastated the grain storage industry and angered other grain-exporting countries.   By encouraging farmers to grow less food and send more of what they do produce overseas, the Federal Government has mostly quit the expensive business of storing huge supplies of grain. Poor harvests in the last two years also contributed to clearing out stockpiles. Reserves are now so low that the Agriculture Department may soon start giving cash subsidies to exporters instead of free grain and dairy products."

Caterpillar has clearly become competitive against almost any rival. So now the question is: Should wage restraint continue, to allow an already-efficient company to get a leg up on competitors, here and abroad?    Put more broadly, the issue is whether corporate America, after a decade of holding down wages, should turn to other methods for improving competitiveness -- better management techniques, for example, or more emphasis on research and product development. Caterpillar says its own advantage has come in part from just such efforts. But holding down labor costs keeps a permanent place in the Caterpillar formula."

While significant regulatory hurdles remain, the challenge could open the door to greater competition against the $100 billion local monopoly enjoyed by GTE and the ""Baby Bells.""    Earlier this month, Terrence L. Barnich, chairman of the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state utility regulator, proposed making Chicago into a ""telecommunications free-trade zone,"" with a full range of competition. ""Other than the regulatory climate, there is no reason why a hundred flowers couldn't bloom here,"" Mr. Barnich said in an interview yesterday.  Reselling Services     Responding to that call, Metropolitan Fiber Systems Inc. in Chicago asked the Illinois Commerce Commission on Friday to be allowed to provide many of the same services to business customers as Illinois Bell, the local provider. It is essentially asking for the right to buy and resell parts of Illinois Bell service to Metropolitan Fiber's business customers."

Its price tag, due this month, is likely to reflect Soviet politics and guesswork as much as financial analysis.    The Bear, Stearns effort, undertaken at the request of the Soviet Government, is important because it offers an analytic approach for valuing a company that operates in a society without normal guidelines, like stock prices, real estate values and the cost of labor, once the Government no longer sets Soviet wages. The goal is to come up with a cash-flow figure -- a rough measure of Volga Auto's potential earnings in hard currency that would indicate the return on Fiat's investment."

Here, Pearl Harbor is regarded as a sideshow to Japan's real ambitions in World War II -- the creation of a ""Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere,"" an economic and military empire that stretched from the coal mines of Manchuria to the oilfields of Indonesia.   Fifty years later, in radically different form and with very different purposes, the co-prosperity sphere lives on. Over the last decade, while America's attention was elsewhere, Japan has poured billions of dollars and enormous energy into the region, building car factories and electronics plants here on the edge of the Malaysian jungle, employing thousands in the Thai countryside and erecting giant shopping centers and office towers in Hong Kong and Singapore."

Two-Part Strategy     As Apple executives have suggested, the company seems to be separating its strategy into two parts -- one focusing on products for individuals and the other on more complex networks of computers for large corporations.

If they would agree on a standard, he says, Nintendo games could be played on a rival Sega machine, opening up the entire segment to growth and innovation.   Mr. Hawkins is no longer just talking.

And some people who have been leaning on the Federal Reserve to ease for years, including the Bush Administration, have seized on anemic money growth as a rationale for pressing the Fed to lower short-term rates -- already the lowest since 1973 -- some more.    But Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs, contends that the latest obsession with the money supply is a little crazy, if not downright dangerous. Money growth is not a reliable guide to the economy's direction in the short run, he said. So tying Fed policy too mechanically to the money supply risks supplying more stimulus than the economy can safely handle and a future inflation flare-up."

His method of adding stores at a 30-a-year clip increased sales and generated cash but did little to give Ann Taylor any special offering for the sophisticated career women who have patronized the store for its 37 years."

The flow of arms began only a few months after the American hostages seized at the United States Embassy in Teheran in 1979 were released on Inauguration Day in 1981. The United States specifically authorized Israel to make the sales to Iran for a period that by different accounts ranged from 6 to 18 months. But the United States watched them continue after that, even as the Reagan Administration aggressively promoted a public campaign, known as Operation Staunch, to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran. First Evidence of Link    Occasional published reports since 1981 have linked Israel to the sale of some American-made arms and spare parts to Iran in the early 1980's, but no United States Government authority for those sales has been publicly demonstrated before now. The change in policy came before the Iranian-sponsored seizure of American hostages in Lebanon began in 1982, eventually leading the White House to trade arms for hostages in the Iran-contra affair."

But times change. The new, downsizing Pentagon is looking for ways to trim costs, and one of the places it's looking hardest at is expensive customized equipment designed to military specifications, or ""milspecs."" The nascent movement to buy commercial got a major lift from the performance of off-the-shelf electronics equipment during the conflict in the Persian Gulf. Last month Compuadd Inc., which sent desktop computers to the gulf, got an order for more machines that may eventually be worth as much as $1 billion.   Gregory E. Saunders, a Pentagon manufacturing and modernization specialist, and something of a caped crusader for the virtues of buying commercial, regards the desktop contract as an epiphany. For the last five years he has worked to move a military accustomed to layers of bureaucracy and going by the book toward more flexibility on procurement. The Air Force, which granted the Compuadd contract, ""did some neat, innovative things,"" Mr. Saunders said, adding: ""It took some nerve to do it. Somebody took a risk."""

But Sunrise Technologies Inc., a four-year-old medical laser company in Fremont, Calif., has made the heat problem moot by turning the continuous beam into a series of pulses that occur too quickly to burn. The company's neodymium yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser, called the dLASE 300, pulses for one six-thousandth of a second at different speeds along a quartz optical fiber one-third of a millimeter in diameter through a handpiece and out the tip.

The book, by Seymour M. Hersh, an investigative reporter, says the Israelis have gone to full nuclear alert -- meaning that nuclear missiles have been wheeled out of silos and put on launchers -- three times, twice during the 1973 war and once this year, while Israel was under missile attack from Iraq. In those cases, the book says, the targets would have been the Arab nations threatening Israel.

Mr. Hersh says Israel used American reconnaissance-satellite photos and other intelligence data -- some of it obtained openly and some of it illegally -- to target Soviet cities."

In the old days, long-term security was the reward for an employee's loyalty, but no more. As they watched productivity and competitiveness slip, companies opted for factory closings, staff ""consolidations"" and early retirements to put their financial houses in order. Even companies known for their loyalty, like International Business Machines, cut jobs to increase competitiveness. For their part, employees watched loyalty sacrificed to the bottom line, and they grew more realistic -- and selfish."

Five times as many blue-collar jobs have evaporated, and jobless rates are more than twice as severe.   More and more, blue-collar workers are facing the harsh truth that though the economy will no doubt come back, their lost jobs are probably gone for good, given the relentless advance of automation and international competition. Last week's announcement by the General Motors Corporation that it plans to shut 21 assembly plants and shed more than 70,000 jobs over the next few years -- only about a third of the cuts will come from the salaried ranks -- was just the most recent indication that the squeeze on blue-collar factory workers will continue."

In an industry so concentrated that six insurers handle three-fourths of the nation's properties, the fallout could be substantial."

The services range from traditional visiting-nurse associations to a host of entrepreneurial start-ups like Calldoctor Inc., a San Diego-based mobile emergency-room service. ""We think it is going to be the fastest-growing business segment from the mid-1990's until well into the next century,"" said Gerald Celente, director of the Socio-Economic Research Institute of America in Rhinebeck, N.Y.

But physicians at the frontiers of home health care are also expanding their work to include some stunningly acute and complex cases."

Two approaches -- one already well tested by Northern Telecom, the other under development by Motorola -- demonstrate that responding to environmental concerns can sometimes cut costs without affecting the reliability of the product.   Although best known as a refrigerant and as a blowing agent in plastic-foam production, the family of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons is widely used to clean newly soldered electronic circuit boards. But CFC's, as they are generally known, have been linked to the degradation of the earth's protective ozone layer. Production Is Ending    By international agreement, CFC production is to be phased out by the end of the century. And that deadline may well move up as political leaders respond to environmental concerns and to mounting evidence of the adverse effect of CFC's on the atmosphere. Moreover, the price of the compounds is going up because of production cutbacks and increasingly stiff Federal taxes."

The recession was supposed to be short and shallow, but it has lasted 17 months -- 11 months is the average. And the tumble was no less deep than in other recessions. The recovery,      supposed to be vigorous,      has stalled. Last week the White House acknowledged something was amiss:      ""The economy is going very slow,"" said Marlin Fitzwater, a White House spokesman. On Friday,      the Federal Reserve again cut the discount rate, this time by an eye-popping      full percentage point, to 3.5 percent. So where is the economy headed     ? Has the Administration's      rel     iance     on interest-rate cuts as its major policy lever worked?      Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns & Company Inc., Marc A. Miles, executive vice president of H. C. Wainwright & Company Economics Inc. and Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company Inc., shared their views with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times.

The tourists who normally flood Cartagena, providing the city with its main source of income, shunned it in favor of less dangerous destinations. As a result, Cartagena suffered losses of $50 million from August 1989 to July 1990, according to official estimates."

The discovery was seen by archeologists as strengthening the emerging view that the people of the Amazon, far from being held back by their environment, managed their limited resources so well that they achieved technological and esthetic advances long before other American cultures. This is leading to a new understanding of the ecology of cultural development."

Baked goods do not naturally brown when prepared in microwave ovens, and researchers believe the reason is that heating takes place from the inside out. Moisture is continually pushed from the center of a biscuit to the surface, keeping the outside surface too cool to turn crusty."

The new demands were announced five days after Bush Administration officials made public the United States' intention to withdraw all nuclear weapons based in South Korea, satisfying the principal North Korean condition for permitting outside nuclear inspections. But the new conditions announced today, including a demand that South Korea renounce the protection of any kind of American nuclear weapons, appeared to dampen the chances of progress in easing nuclear tensions on the Korean Peninsula."

But if the Nov. 15 squall presaged no hurricane, neither did fair weather return. With the economic outlook still dark, the market fell another 40 points to 2,902 by week's end.    In recent years, sharp drops like the Nov. 15 one have presented buying opportunities. But so far, the brave souls have held back. Some analysts think it's simple: even after the drop, stocks are still pricey. And, as the Birinyi Associates research implies, a 3.9 percent drop, although painful, is just not all that huge. Remember that the Dow dropped 22.6 percent in the 1987 crash, 6.9 percent in October 1989."

The once proclaimed ""King of Wall Street"" began the year on a high note, seeing his work crystalize with the kind of success and recognition he had always craved. After several years of stumbling under failed investment banking efforts, Salomon Brothers Inc., the firm he guided to become one of the biggest powers on Wall Street, was turning in the most successful returns in its history. And Mr. Gutfreund's place in the social world was being solidified, as he served as a leader for some prestigious events, like the John V. Lindsay Prize fundraising dinner in February, where he was selected as the event's chairman."

The mask received its first field testing recently as a helicopter crew fought a brush fire near Vina, Calif., about 90 miles north of Sacramento.   Made of polycarbonate plastic and rubber, the full-face respirator is equipped with two blunt antennae-like protrusions, which contain electrically charged fiberglass filters and activated-charcoal cartridges. These air-purifying elements prevent the inhalation of smoke particles, vapors from burning plants and acid gases."

And yet the labels on products, many involved in the labeling process agree, are so opaque or confusing that only consumers with the hermeneutic abilities of a Talmudic scholar can peel back the encoded layers of meaning.   That is because labels spring not from disinterested scientific reasoning but from lobbying, negotiation and compromise. Advocates from the hundreds of businesses, industry and consumer groups, government agencies and scientific organizations with an interest in food, alcohol, tobacco, pesticides, or any of the other products that require labels are involved in the process."

Price controls guaranteed that everything for sale would be affordable, while assuring there would hardly be anything to buy.    But this time, argues Orin Kramer, the head of a Princeton, N.J., consulting firm and the author of a new study of auto and workers' compensation insurance for the Insurance Information Institute, the joke is on us. He contends that regulated rates are eroding the industry's capacity to pay out claims and are creating a crazy-quilt of subsidies in which low-risk consumers cover the expenses of high-risk consumers. Perhaps more important, he says, price controls are masking the core problem of accident insurance, delaying the day when policy makers tackle escalating legal and medical costs."

The Daily News of New York, which is owned by one of the companies, later filed in New York for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. For the moment, the newspaper, once America's most widely circulated daily, will continue to be published. But it is likely that new attempts will be made to sell The Daily News."

Cuts Ratings on G.M. and Revises Outlook on Ford,"  Large and continuing losses at the nation's two largest auto makers prompted the Standard & Poor's Corporation today to lower the ratings on the preference and preferred shares of General Motors and revise its ratings outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable"" for the bonds and preference shares of Ford.    S.& P. said it had lowered the G.M. ratings by one notch. It also warned that it might reduce the ratings on $90 billion of the company's debt, the ratings of which were last lowered in February.

""Words of apology, however genuine they may be, cannot erase the past curses of the victims,"" said Makoto Tanabe, the Socialist Party chairman, in a speech intended as a rebuttal to recent Government statements. ""But failure to apologize will erase the bright future courses of the former aggressor."""

Harushige Taniguchi, a weathered tobacco farmer, says that after the Mount Unzen volcano erupted in June, covering parts of this seaside town with ash, lava and gas, killing 43 people and forcing him from the land he had spent his life working, he merely began to plan how he would rebuild his life.   By no means has this been Japan's deadliest disaster, but what has made it a new kind of challenge is the fact that, six months later, Mr. Taniguchi and more than 8,000 other residents are still unable to return to their homes, which lie in a guarded evacuation zone. It is uncertain when, if ever, they will. Mount Unzen remains an angry, smoldering presence above the area, with the whitish gray lava dome at its peak bulging ominously, and scientists say it is too unstable for residents to return."

The choice? To admit intent or to acknowledge ignorance -- to look like crooks or schnooks.  From a crisis management perspective, systemic fraud and abuse of power -- actual or perceived -- are the most difficult situations to contain. In the current environment of widespread public skepticism, the burden of proof falls on the person or organization suspected of abuse. Leaders faced with allegations can appear stupid or incompetent -- or admit to prior knowledge or an intent to defraud. At stake are the executives' reputations and exposure to liability and the viability of their businesses."

But the technique will not work for pork farmers, because pig sperm does not stand freezing, and artificial insemination is of limited use with horses, because horse sperm can be refrigerated only briefly. But now a Gulph Mills, Pa., company that specializes in commercializing biotechnology patents is working on a method of preserving sperm that requires no refrigeration.   The company, British Technology Group USA, uses a polymer gel to encapsulate the sperm. At room temperature, the polymer solidifies, immobilizing the sperm and lowering their metabolic activity. The polymer is permeable, letting oxygen in and waste products out. Because it is encapsulated in the polymer, the sperm can be sent through the mail. In the case of cows and mice -- the only species for which the technology has been demonstrated so far -- the sperm can survive up to 21 days."

Loses $1.8 Billion; Other Phone Results Mixed,"  A.T.& T. and MCI, the nation's top long-distance companies, yesterday reported slow third-quarter revenue growth, with a huge loss at A.T.& T. because of one-time charges and an earnings gain at MCI. Three of the regional Bell operating companies reported mixed results, with profits off at Nynex and up at BellSouth and Southwestern Bell.    Analysts said A.T.& T.'s performance was surprisingly strong, despite the reported net loss of $1.8 billion. The loss was entirely attributable to previously reported one-time charges, mostly related to its acquistion of the NCR Corporation. MCI apparently gained a small amount of market share in the quarter, analysts said, but at the expense of smaller competitors.   The weak economy was apparent in both the volume of calling and the rate of new line installation reported by the three ""Baby Bells."" ""From a telephone industry perspective, the recession is still with us,"" said Joel Gross, who follows the companies for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.    Following are the details of the companies' results: A.T.& T.     One-time charges resulting from the takeover of NCR reduced net income for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in the quarterby nearly $2.65 billion, producing a net loss of $1.8 billion, compared with combined profits for the two companies of $803 million, or 62 cents a share, a year ago. Combined revenues rose 1.2 percent, to more than $11.04 billion, from $10.91 billion in the third quarter of 1990.   Nearly all of A.T.& T.'s operating profits for the quarter came from the telephone business. The company's third-quarter net profits from what it owned before acquiring NCR rose 13.5 percent, to $808 million, from $712 million a year ago. About a fourth of that improvement was attributable to a one-time gain on the sale of Sun Microsystems stock. The rest came from strong operating revenues, including improved product and service margins.   By contrast, NCR's operating earnings were just $40 million on revenues of $1.38 billion, compared with $91 million on sales of $1.53 billion a year ago. A.T.& T. attributed the decline to ""general softness"" in computer markets and the negative impact of a stronger dollar.   ""The good news in all these numbers is the continuing strength of A.T.& T.'s long-distance business and the strong actions we're taking for future earnings growth,"" said Robert E. Allen, A.T.& T.'s chairman and chief executive.   Phone service sales rose 5.1 percent, to $5.24 billion, on volume growth of 6.5 percent. The company said that ""800"" numbers, WATS services and international and residential calling led the growth. Product and systems sales declined 5.5 percent, to $3.81 billion, from 1990's third quarter, mostly because of a 17.3 percent decline in computer sales to $818 million.    Analysts believe A.T.& T., which is estimated to have between 63 and 65 percent of the long-distance market, has maintained that share.   A.T.& T.'s write-off will include the severance costs for 14,000 employees to be laid off by the beginning of 1994.    A.T.& T. shares fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $39, on the New York Stock Exchange. MCI     The MCI Communications Corporation earned $133 million, or 51 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $176 million in the 1990 period, when the company took a one-time charge of $550 million for modernization of its network.    The Washington-based long-distance company's revenues were $2.15 billion, up 7.5 percent from $2 billion a year ago. The revenue gains came on a 12.4 percent increase in calling volume in the last year.   Excluding the impact of last year's special charge, MCI's third-quarter operating earnings in 1990 would have been $334 million, nearly 22 percent higher than the $274 million reported yesterday for the recently completed quarter. That gap highlights how heavily MCI has been spending on programs to build market share, particularly a promotion gives 20 percent discounts to customers who create a personal circle of telephone contacts, all using MCI. Marketing and operations expenses for the recent quarter were $645 million, up 21 percent from a year ago.   MCI's shares lost $3, to $27.125, in over-the-counter trading. The trading reflected, in addition to earnings, a report that I.B.M. was exploring the potential private sale of its $400 million in MCI preferred stock. I.B.M. said last night that the possible sale does not represent a loss of confidence in MCI. Nynex     The Nynex Corporation said that it earned $291.8 million, or $1.44 a share, in the quarter, down 1.7 percent from $296.7 million, or $1.50 a share, last year. Revenues for the White Plains, N.Y.-based parent of New York Telephone and New England Telephone fell 3.5 percent, to $3.27 billion, from $3.39 billion a year ago.   Nynex's operating income actually rose 3.3 percent, to $600.2 million, from $580.9 million a year ago, but that increase did not compensate for a $24 million rise in taxes and interest expenses. Operating expenses were $2.67 billion, down nearly 5 percent from $2.81 billion a year ago.   Nynex is currently in the midst of a program to reduce both its hourly and managerial work forces. A one-time charge for the cost of the program will be estimated and taken against earnings in the current quarter, the company said yesterday.   Nynex's shares rose 12.5 cents, closing at $75.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.  BellSouth     The BellSouth Corporation, based in Atlanta, said net income fell 12.5 percent, to $352.4 million, or 73 cents a share, from $402.9 million, or 84 cents a share, a year ago. But the current quarter included $42.9 million in one-time charges for an early-retirement program and another $11.4 million charge stemming from accounting changes in the company's cellular telephone operations. Without the one-time charges, earnings were essentially unchanged from a year ago.   Revenues rose 2.3 percent, to $3.63 billion, from $3.55 billion a year ago. The number of access lines rose 2.9 percent, to 513,000, in the the last year.   BellSouth said that continuing rate reductions, a weak economy, competition and the costs of its rapidly expanding investment in cellular and paging services affected its earnings.   On the Big Board, BellSouth stock fell 37.5 cents, to $46.875.  Southwestern Bell     The Southwestern Bell Corporation said that net income for the quarter rose 12.2 percent, to $363.1 million, or $1.21 a share, from $323.6 million, or $1.08 a share, a year ago.    The strong income gain came despite an increase of just more than 2 percent in revenues, to $2.42 billion, from $2.37 billion in the 1990 period.   ""Strengthened performance by our cellular and Yellow Pages subsidiaries contributed substantially to our growth,"" said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the St. Louis-based company's chairman and chief executive.   Analysts said the figures represented a mildly pleasant surprise.   Southwestern Bell stock rose 37.5 cents, to $56.375, on the Big Board."

Gorbachev resigned last week and the Soviet Union's Parliament voted itself out of existence, Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's President, became the informal leader of a new, loosely organized, Commonwealth of Independent States. Mr. Yeltsin inherits a vast, tattered economy. ""About 70 percent of the population now lives below the poverty line,"" said Vladimir Kvint, a lecturer at Babson College. Mr. Yeltsin has a plan. New rules go into effect next week allowing foreign companies to own rubles and invest freely in Russian companies. And next week, prices will be re-formed (upward) so they better reflect production costs. Even so, the plan has a gaping hole. ""There is still no real privatization,"" said Mr. Kvint. ""Only a handful of the 1.15 million legal entities are private,"" he said. Until Mr. Yeltsin enacts a privatization law, ""the reforms will be very difficult to carry out,"" he said. A Rise in Orders of Durables    Sales at the malls may have fizzled this Christmas season, but airplanes, satellites and jet engines did very well. According to the Commerce Department, orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items that are supposed to last three years or more -- rose by 1.2 percent in November. ""It looks like what we might be seeing here is the beginning of a turnaround,"" said Michael L. Penzer, an economist at the BankAmerica Corporation. A Drop in Personal Income    Turnaround? Not so fast. The Commerce Department said that personal income contracted by three-tenths of 1 percent in October due to layoffs. Bullishness at the O.T.C.     With the Dow Jones industrial average reaching record highs -- it closed the week at 3,101.92 -- individual investors are back in the market. But the Big Board's not the only one doing well. Nasdaq's over-the-counter market reported last week that 1991 will be its best year ever, with more than 41 billion shares traded worth an estimated $690 billion. Disney's Tangled Dress Code   Don't expect to see unkempt mice at Disneyland. That's what the Walt Disney Company said as it began hiring 12,000 people to work at its $4.5 billion Euro Disneyland theme park near Paris. Violating the company's dress code (Only one earring per ear, please.) can result in dismissal. ""For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product-identification standpoint,"" said Thor Degelmann, vice president for human resources at Euro Disneyland. But Disney's rules on acceptable clothing, hair styles and -- yes -- even pantyhose, have gotten the company into a legal tussle. France, after all, is the birthplace of la liberte. One union appealed to the Government in the name of ""human dignity."" The Government may take Disney to court to determine if the code violates French law. Picking Over the Soviet Splinters    Put aside questions about who controls the defunct Soviet Union's hoard of strategic nuclear missiles and there is still the problem of what to do when a unified market of 300 million suddenly splinters. United States Ambassador Robert S. Strauss is telling people to invest, if they can stomach the risk. Not everyone agrees. ""There have always been drumbeaters for investment. I'm not one of them at this time,"" said Benjamin Weiner, president of Probe International, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. ""The republics are places for raw materials like oil, metals and diamonds, not investment,"" he said. Ethnic tensions are likely to rise, he said. ""Russia has 31 contending ethnic regions. Those rivalries will never go away."" More Gripes With Japan    Economists say Japan's economy is slowing down. (It's still growing faster than any other industrial nation). But slow growth or not, its current account surplus is surging, mostly from trade. The Finance Ministry said last week that Japan's surplus with the rest of the world for November was $7.26 billion, a 330 percent increase from the year before and its best showing ever. Japan's current account surplus for fiscal 1991 could exceed $100 billion -- double its 1990 figure. The Bush Administration is miffed by the rise since trade talks have been going on for more than a decade. ""It's the only major trading partner with whom we haven't lowered our trading deficit over the last couple of years,"" said Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.   Japan said no last week to imports of rice ""We all agreed that Japan's interests are to be considered as well as those of the other negotiators,"" said Koichi Kato, Japan's chief cabinet officer. With its huge surpluses it's hard to argue Japan's has been ignored. The French Insurance Rescue    The Executive Life Insurance Company moved a step closer to becoming French last week when a California Superior Court Judge, Kurt J. Lewin, approved the $3.55 billion bail out bid from a group led by Credit Lyonnais, the big French bank. Executive Life met its demise when its huge portfolio of junk bonds collapsed in value. Policyholders are expected to receive 95 percent of the value of their policies up to $100,000. Large policyholders are expected to receive slightly less. Not a bad settlement considering insurers, unlike banks, are not Federally insured. Kevin Maxwell Quits    Kevin Maxwell, son of the late Robert Maxwell, resigned last week as publisher of The New York Daily News. Kevin Maxwell, British authorities allege, may have had a role in the collapse of the family businesses and in the movement of money from the public Maxwell companies into the private ones. The Maxwell public companies owe about $4.4 billion. Cray vs. Cray vs. Cray    First there was Cray Research Inc., the computer company started by Seymour Cray, who built the world's first supercomputer. Then there was the Cray Computer Corporation, the upstart supercomputer maker spun off from Cray Research by Mr. Cray. But Cray Computer's survival is now in question.  The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last week canceled the upstart's contract to build a $30 million, superfast machine based on tricky new technology and an untested gallium arsenide chip. Researchers were getting antsy because Cray was taking so long to build the machine. The lab will buy the Y-MP C-90 supercomputer made by Cray Research, Mr. Cray's original company. ""In this market you've got choices,"" said Gary Smaby, an analyst with the Smaby Group in Minneapolis. Michael Milken's Many Suitors    While Michael Milken, the imprisoned junk-bond king, meditates on his wrongdoings, dozens of claims worth billions of dollars are being filed against him and his former employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Drexel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1990. Last week, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack, who is overseeing Drexel's bankruptcy, ordered the claimants against Mr. Milken and Drexel to combine their claims into a single, ""universal settlement."" Some of the claimants are investors who lost money, others are state and Federal regulators seeking to recover what they spent bailing out bankrupt savings and loan institutions that bought Drexel junk bonds. If the suits are combined, the proceedings will be speeded up and millions of dollars in legal fees will be saved. But the talks must proceed quickly. The first suit goes to court next April. A Bit of Americana Fades    They are not the toniest stores in town . Still, the McCrory Corporation has a lot of them -- 1,000 nationwide. But hurt by the weak economy and large losses last year, McCrory said it would close 229 stores in January. A Forgiving Fannie Mae    The Federal National Mortgage Association -- Fannie Mae -- acknowledged last week that phony bidding has been common in its sales of mortgages. But Fannie Mae said it would be lenient -- this time. Rather than impose financial penalties on the 53 banks and Wall Street firms that buy billions of dollars worth of its mortgage securities, Fannie Mae would simply put the firms on probation while it changes its record keeping and auditing procedures. After that, any new violations could result in suspension. ""We couldn't come up with a justification for money fines based on our analysis of the selling action,"" said Frank D. Raines, Fannie Mae's vice chairman. That's a rather enlightened view. But what about the integrity of the market? The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into that.  G.M.'s Stubborn Consistency    The General Motors Corporation hit upon a novel way to motivate the work force last week, and it didn't come from Japan. Give bonuses to the white-collar workers -- the management team that put the nation's No. 1 car company on a trajectory to 73,000 or more layoffs by 1995, possibly $8 billion in losses this year and the closing of 21 assembly plants. Then take away the bonuses traditionally given to the blue-collar work force -- the people who actually build the cars. The formula may not necessarily get the results G.M.'s upper management is looking for. ""We kept our promise to our employees,"" said John Maciarz, a spokesman for the company. The United Auto Workers, upset by the deal, does not agree. A Macabre Relic -- Sold!     Here's an investment with some upside potential: the pistol Jack Ruby used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. The gun, a .38-caliber Colt Cobra, sold for $220,000 at an auction of Americana held last week in New York. What will the buyer, whose identity was not disclosed, do with the gun? ""I guess he's going to put it away,"" said Frank Roman, who submitted the bid on the collector's behalf."

Analysts were quick to point to the week's bad news: Retail and auto sales were off and the Producer Price Index rose unexpectedly. ""Concern about the economy is clearly intensifying,"" said Hugh Johnson, an analyst at First Albany Corporation in Albany, N.Y. But on reflection, the news last week was not so different from the week before -- or the week before that. So why did the market drop? ""There's a general pattern that the amount of the movement doesn't necessarily match up with the news,"" said Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank in Washington. ""That's a puzzle to people who believe in a perfectly rational market,"" Mr. Summers said. Traders sitting at computers also have tools that make selling easier. ""That exacerbates things when the market goes down,"" Mr. Summers said. Midway Left Out in the Cold  Midway Airlines thought it was being handed a lifeline when Northwest Airlines said it would acquire the bankrupt carrier by taking over its $153 million of debt. But Midway, based in Chicago, ended up feeling it had been handed a line when Northwest abruptly withdrew from the deal. Last week Midway, which employs 4,300 people, shut down. ""There's no choice. We don't have any money,"" said David Hinson, Midway's chairman. Analysts say the deal unraveled partly because Northwest, a unit of cash-strapped NWA Inc., based in Minneapolis, had received a $740 million loan from the state of Minnesota. Midway's precarious existence -- it was losing $1 million a day -- made Minnesota officials nervous. But Northwest said the deal was off because Midway gave it misleading financial information. Midway disagrees. Fifty-nine Midway planes remain where they last touched down. Barbie, Minnie and Dumbo Too  They have been tumbling off the assembly line together since 1987 -- Barbie, G.I. Joe and Mickey and Minnie Mouse, that is. Last week, the Walt Disney Company and Mattel Inc., which already reaps $160 million in sales from its Disney-related toy line, agreed to extend their licensing agreement for 10 years. The new agreement will give Mattel the right to produce more Disney characters. Pinnochio, Bambi and Dumbo will be added to the list as well as all 101 Dalmations.  DEC Sides With Microsoft  Since summer, the International Business Machines Corporation has entered into more alliances than a delegate at a Presidential convention. But last week, its rival, the Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's No. 2 computer maker, made an alliance of its own with I.B.M.'s arch-nemesis, the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's No. 1 software maker. (I.B.M., once cozy with Microsoft, is now betting on software from Apple Computer Inc. instead.) DEC will now be able to integrate Microsoft's programs, including Windows, into its new offerings. Microsoft gets access to DEC's huge network of six million installed computers. ""Windows is a big wave in the market right now,"" said Rick Sherlund, of Goldman Sachs & Company. ""I.B.M.'s fighting it, and DEC wants to ride with it.""  A Dreary, Dreary Christmas  Even with falling interest rates, consumers are watching their wallets as they wander into the department stores. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales fell by 0.1 percent in October. ""The outlook for the Christmas season is not really wonderful,"" said Kathryn L. Kobe an economist at Joel Popkin & Company in Washington.  The French to the Rescue  After months of wrangling, California's insurance regulators selected a French group headed by Altus Finance, the investment arm of Credit Lyonnais, to take over the defunct Executive Life Insurance Company. They chose the French group because it promised to return more money to Executive Life's 372,000 nervous policyholders. Ninety-seven percent of them will have no losses, said John Garamendi, California's Insurance Commissioner. The French group was also chosen because it will transfer Executive's huge portfolio of junk bonds into a separate business.  Selling Off Maxwell's Empire  It did not take long. Last week Goldman Sachs & Company sold two million shares of Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C., which was founded by the late Robert Maxwell. ECONOMY   The Slippery Surge  When the Producer Price Index was released last week by the Commerce Department, even the coolest economist's heart sank. The index showed a 0.7 percent surge in inflation at the producer level. Slow growth and inflation reminded some seasoned number-crunchers of the ""stagflation"" that plagued the economy in the 1970's. But on closer examination, economists were mollified somewhat. The inflation figures were skewed by an almost random run-up of prices for a most unlikely assortment of goods. The problem, said some economists, was that the Commerce Department did not properly correct for seasonal factors. ""I think it's an aberration,"" said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics in Washington.  Giving the Numbers Meaning  It's not the numbers; it's how you interpret them. So what is the meaning of the modest 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices in October, the smallest gain in seven months? ""It is encouraging,"" said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities.  ""But this is the point in the cycle when the Fed typically eases rates too much when it should be patient."" That interpretation means when growth comes, so will inflation. Those Wacky Market Forces  The next candidate for a Presidential veto emerged from the House last week. It is the plan to put a cap on the interest rates charged by credit card issuers. The House plan would cap rates at about 14 percent. Most cards now carry rates of 18 or 19 percent, while the banks that issue them pay 7 percent or even less for their money. The Administration said it wants lower rates (who doesn't?) but prefers that market forces set them. Aren't those the forces that pushed rates up? Will the Market Catch the Wave?   With the market's 120.31 point drop last week, the nervous chatter on the street turned to the ""wave"" -- not the football wave, the Elliot Wave. The Elliot Wave measures mass psychology, its adherents say. Bunkum, detractors say. But ""wavologists"" point to the wave's last big high -- the summer of 1987. After that, the crash. Now they sense a new top has come and gone. ""The Elliot wave is about patterns. We think everything has peaked -- real estate, collectibles, jobs on Wall Street,"" said David Allman, research director for the Elliot Wave Theorist, an investor newsletter in Gainsville, Ga. What's next? ""Sometime in the next three years the stock market will be trading at half what it is now."" Congress Fiddles, Bush Burns  President Bush vetoed two bills intended to extend unemployment benefits. The latest one is being held up by Congress. The House passed a bill last week that provides up to 20 weeks of additional unemployment insurance benefits to three million Americans who have been out of work for at least half a year. But the bill treats each state differently: Connecticut gets 20 additional weeks; Alabama gets just six. Those differences made the Senate balk. Senate and House leaders are haggling while President Bush is shouting ""just approve it."" The bill will cost $5.1 billion and is intended to pay for itself. How? From an increase in the estimated tax payments of some taxpayers and from a two-tenths of 1 percent surcharge added to the unemployment taxes employers pay. In Washington, that's the closest anything gets to ""paying for itself."" The Manufacturing Blues  Just when it seemed as if the manufacturing sector was snapping back to life, a study released by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment says ""beware."" The five-year study says American manufacturing has lost its competitive edge and needs the Government's help to regain its luster. Support is split along party lines: the Democrats for it, Republicans against.  INTERNATIONAL   Hedging a Flyer on the U.S.S.R.  The recent coup in the Soviet Union, or what's left of it, did not do much to attract investors. So last week, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Government agency, said it would provide $100 million of insurance coverage against expropriation, political violence and currency convertibility problems to an American investment group called the Soviet Companies Fund. The fund, sponsored by Batterymarch Financial Management in Boston and the State Commission on Military Industrial Products in Moscow, plans to invest $250 million, primarily in companies that make products for the military. OPIC will charge up to 60 cents for each $100 insured. But OPIC may lose on the deal. ""The Soviet Union is really not a very good credit risk,"" said Benjamin Weiner, of Probe International, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. British Standoffishness Softens  A single currency for the European Community seems pretty likely now. Prime Minister John Major of Britain indicated last week that he is prepared to accept a single currency by the end of the century. But he said he is against closer political ties between countries. So how will they manage the currency? Even Japan Is Slowing Down  Last week, the Bank of Japan lowered its discount rate to 5 percent from 5.5 percent. The Japanese economy is a little out of breath. ""Japan is not headed for recession, but it is slowing,"" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. ""This is not the last discount rate cut this cycle."""

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, by refusing to say that his return to power was a necessary precondition for Washington to feel that democracy has been restored in Haiti.   On Sunday American officials in Port-au-Prince and Washington signaled privately that they were moving away from their unequivocal support of Father Aristide, in light of concerns over his human rights record. Today, when the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, was asked if that was the case, he responded with a less than ringing endorsement for the Haitian President, and suggested that Washington was most interested in the restoration of constitutional democracy in Haiti, not a particular individual."

Moody's said that the affluent suburban Nashville community had had a strong tax-base expansion along with solid population growth.    Maria Matesanz, an assistant vice president for the Southeast regional group at Moody's, said that Brentwood's population was 16,392 in the 1990 census, an increase of 73.8 percent since 1980. ""The per-capita income is 198 percent above the state average,"" she said.

Conventional computers try to match patterns of incoming signals with patterns stored in their memories."

About 2,000 industry executives, here at the annual convention of the American Petroleum Institute, lamented that the Senate recently voted not to consider an energy bill that would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. Worse, they said, 11 Eastern states are rushing to join California in a new system of automobile pollution control, a program that the oil companies think will mean strict gasoline specifications. And they complained about the Clean Air Act of 1990, which mandates cleaner gasoline, and about laws intended to protect underground water supplies.  'Inefficient Diversions'     Charles DiBona, the president of the institute, who has recently taken to referring to some new environmental regulations as ""stupid,"" said in a speech to the convention, ""There may have been times in the past when U.S. economic supremacy allowed this country to indulge in costly, inefficient diversions, but there won't be such times in the highly competitive world that lies ahead.""   He added: ""Inefficient regulation does hurt U.S. industries and working people. Plants will be driven elsewhere. Good jobs will be harder to come by.""   The oil companies have long complained about the cost of environmental regulations, but most complaints were muted in the period of environmental concern after the grounding of the Exxon Valdez, the mass demonstrations on Earth Day and the passage last year of amibitious amendments to the Clean Air Act. That period of reticence appears to be over.    The institute's departing chairman, Allen E. Murray, chairman of the Mobil Corporation, said he thought the public mood was changing.   ""There is no doubt that the environment is the issue of the decade, but people are beginning to realize that there will be trade-offs,"" he said at a news conference, citing the state of the economy. ""I sense that we'll see a little bit of judgment. I hope it doesn't take harder economic times to do it.""    The institute's new chairman, C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive of the Phillips Petroleum Company, complained of ""the amount of money we're spending to take care of emotional problems and not physical problems.""    The attack on environmental initiatives was carried on by Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of Britain, who was the main speaker today. Mrs. Thatcher, who was once a research chemist, said oil company executives were as concerned as environmentalists about providing a clean environment for their children. But, she said, the country should ""have solutions that are sound scientifically, and some of the ones proposed are not.""  Security Issues Fade     Another remarkable shift is the virtual end of talk about energy security, so prominent a year ago when Iraq was occupying Kuwait and the Soviet Union was still a world power.   ""Environmental issues are replacing security issues in driving the oil industry,"" said Thomas G. Burns, manager of economics at the corporate planning and analysis department of the Chevron Corporation.   Adding to the gloom is the industry's lackluster financial performance. A survey released by the institute today said the net income of a group of 20 oil companies had fallen 51 percent in the third quarter, to $2.2 billion, from $4.5 billion last year.    But income last year was swollen by the increase in crude oil prices after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. For the first nine months of this year, net income was $11 billion, down 16 percent from $13.1 billion a year earlier. But oil did better than the rest of the economy over the nine-month period; a comparison group of 100 non-oil companies saw a 50.1 percent drop in income in that period, the survey found. Low Returns     But the industry's recent financial track record is poor. Arthur L. Smith, the chairman of John S. Herrold Inc., a consulting firm that evaluates oil properties, said the rate of return for oil companies, which was running at 20 percent at the beginning of the decade, was 2 percent last year.    ""The numbers suggest that oil companies are in business for the public good, because no economic value has been created,"" he said.    A crucial question for oil companies is whether to invest in their refineries to produce cleaner gasoline that the Clean Air Act will require in years to come. The market for gasoline has been flat for years, and could decline if natural gas, electricity or methanol came into wide use. On the other hand, stricter environmental regulations could protect domestic refiners from competition.   ""The international gasoline market is on the verge of a profound change,"" said Edward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis Inc., a consulting firm in Washington. The United States, with many different gasoline specifications, would turn into a ""boutique market."" It is not clear how many foreign refineries that now export to this country would make the investments to be able to continue to do so, he said."

After all, the newcomers were Japanese, or at least descendants of Japanese who had sought opportunities in South America earlier this century.    Now Japanese have discovered that while the immigrants may look familiar, they act like foreigners. They talk more noisily than native-born Japanese do, and greet each other with laughter and embraces. They have trouble with the language. And they complain about their problems.  The Samba in Tokyo    ""The people of Japan do not respect us,"" said Roberto Ishizuka, a 26-year-old former automobile worker in Sao Paulo who works six long days a week making car seats at a factory here in the region west of Tokyo. ""The Japanese treat us like some kind of an inferior race.""    In Japan these days, Portuguese-language radio programs and newspapers have multiplied, offering news and music from Brazil and advice on problems in Japan. There was even a recent Brazilian street festival flavored with samba and salsa in Tokyo.    At the Tia Maria restaurant here, a couple of dozen Brazilians of Japanese descent were enjoying steaming bowls of feijoada, drinking Brazilian beer and reading newspapers in Portuguese. A sign on the wall warned people to disperse in the late evenings, as requested by the police.    Despite sometimes back-breaking work in foundries, factories and construction sites, life on the whole has been good for the newcomers, who can make $2,000 a month and send half of it home. Often they live in company-owned dormitories and are bused to their 14-hour-a-day jobs.    But the immigrants say they suffer discrimination in stores and restaurants, citing a story of one department store near here that once had a loudspeaker announcement that a group of them had entered and the clerks should be on guard.    Another major problem, workers and Government officials say, is that employers usually pay no health or welfare benefits, leaving workers helpless when injured by molten metal or a sharp blade on the job.   Unscrupulous recruiting agents siphon off their wages, they say, and make sweeping promises about jobs that prove false.    ""The people over here think Brazilians are living in Brazil like wild Indians,"" said Miyako Clemente, who works at an auto-parts company. ""Sometimes I can feel my roots here, and I want to learn and write Japanese. But sometimes it makes me desperate, and I feel like I want to get out.""  Immigrants Total 150,000    In a turbulent world where millions flee oppression and starvation and migrate to other countries, the 150,000 people of Japanese descent looking for work in their ancestral land may seem like a trickle. But it marks a break with decades of Japanese refusal to let in unskilled foreigners.    Not that the need has not been great. Employers universally complain that younger Japanese in a newly affluent society no longer want to do dirty, difficult or dangerous work, and factories, restaurants and shops often seem desperate to fill jobs.    In recent years, many of those jobs have gone to Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Thais and other Asians who come to Japan on tourist visas and remain illegally while the immigration authorities look the other way. Estimates are that more than 100,000 illegal Asian immigrants work in Japan.    But Parliament, worried that the country might become like France or Germany, flooded by foreigners with customs looked on as strange by the native-born majority, enacted tough new curbs on immigration of unskilled people two years ago, and the police began expelling the Asians.  Law Changed for Descendants    Then Japan seemed to discover another pool of workers, descendants of its own people. Last year laws were changed to allow in any foreigner with parents or grandparents in Japan, and the number of workers fleeing the troubled economies of Brazil and Peru rose sharply.    Critics say those policies reflect the latent racism of Japan, which they accuse of turning its back on millions of people desperate for work on their own continent.    ""Japan feels it has to do something about its labor shortage,"" said Kyoko Yotsuya, a volunteer with the Seirei Social Welfare Community, a Christian group here. ""But they're afraid that if they open the doors to anyone, there'll be chaos. So they only want certain kinds of people.""    The reactions of native-born Japanese to the Brazilians seem to involve class considerations as much as racial ones. Americans of Japanese descent, for instance, say they are not looked down on, perhaps because most of them are not here to do factory work.  Dress and Act Differently    The Brazilians, when they arrive and often long afterward, usually speak no Japanese. And they say the native Japanese can often tell they are Brazilians just from the way they dress or act, even before they open their mouths.    Indeed, anyone living in Japan is so aware of the polite and aloof way that Japanese deal with each other in public that it was often startling to see people in Hamamatsu embracing each other noisily in public, until one realized that they were Brazilian and not Japanese.    The first Japanese emigrated to Latin America in the first decade of this century, finding work at coffee and cotton plantations. Later waves worked in factories and raised children who achieved success and prominence, like President Alberto Fujimori of Peru.    But the last couple of years have been troubled ones for the economies of Latin America, and now a large percentage of Japanese descendants, the overwhelming majority from Brazil, have come here for work. When they get into trouble, it is the Brazilian Embassy, not the Japanese authorities, that they turn to.  'Expected to Be Japanese'    ""Somehow, Japan expected them to be Japanese,"" a Brazilian Embassy official in Tokyo said. ""It's been a kind of shock, not only for Japan but for our people. It's harder on them than it is on the rest of us foreigners because there are different expectations for them.""    Japanese officials maintain that the immigrants were not brought in to fill jobs, per se, but only to visit their families.   ""There is a demand for foreign workers, but we did not change the law for that,"" said Kei Ogiso, an official at the immigration bureau of the Justice Ministry.    The Government, meanwhile, has tried to accommodate the new immigrants, establishing a dozen centers in central Japan to assist foreign laborers and tell them of their rights. Brazil plans to open two consulates in areas populated by the immigrants.    ""We are developing necessary protections for them,"" said Kouhei Nagashima, assistant director of the consular and migration policy division at the Foreign Ministry. ""Of course, it is not yet sufficient. But the problem has grown so quickly, we cannot be expected to solve it right away."""

The United States, France and Japan currently require that all blood supplies be screened for the virus, but the company said current tests could not detect the virus until it had incubated for three to six months after the blood had been infected. In addition, they said, current tests produce a high number of results that incorrectly signal the presence of the virus."
