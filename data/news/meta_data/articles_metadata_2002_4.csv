Chief  The White House seemed close to naming as the new Securities and Exchange Commission chairman a lawyer who has been the Justice Department's leading prosecutor on corporate fraud and terrorism cases. But both the lawyer, Michael Chertoff, and White House officials backed away from the idea.    It was not clear whether Mr. Chertoff pulled himself out of the running or whether the White House had second thoughts. But the sudden turn of events added to the disarray as the administration tries to work quickly to find a successor to Harvey L. Pitt. [Page A1.]    Ford Executive Gets More Duties  Ford expanded the duties of David Thursfield, left, one of its top executives, reinforcing speculation that Mr. Thursfield is being groomed to eventually take the No. 2 spot at the company. Ford consolidated its foreign units under Mr. Thursfield. Ford also named James Padilla an executive vice president as well as president of North American operations. [C3.]    Decision Is Near on WorldCom Chief  WorldCom hopes to introduce Michael D. Capellas, the former president of Hewlett-Packard and former chief of Compaq, as its chairman and chief executive as soon as today. [C3]    Ex-Official at Adelphia Pleads Guilty  A former official of Adelphia Communications, James R. Brown, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges and implicated the company's founder and two of his sons in a scheme to mislead investors and regulators. [C7.]    House Passes Terror Insurance Plan  The House adopted legislation providing up to $100 billion in support to the insurance industry for terrorist attacks. [A19.]    An industry-sponsored bill to make it harder for people to erase their debts in bankruptcy appeared to die in the House. [A28]    Argentina Defaults on Bailout Loan  Argentina defaulted on an $805 million loan installment to the World Bank and said it would resume payment when the International Monetary Fund agreed to restore a credit line that had been cut off. [World Business, Section W.]    Quarterly Income Rises 31% at Dell  Dell reported strong gains in quarterly profits and sales, matching expectations. Net income rose 31 percent, to $561 million, or 21 cents, compared with the year-earlier quarter. Sales increased 22 percent, to $9.1 billion. Dell predicted that its strong performance would continue but mainly because of its ability to take business from rivals. [C2.]    Interpublic Seeks a Financial Officer  The Interpublic Group of Companies is beginning a search for a chief operating officer, a job that is virtually certain to be filled from the outside. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C5.]    Kmart's commercial about the holiday products in its Martha Stewart Everyday line does not feature Ms. Stewart. [C5.]    Discount Plan Adding Generic Drugs  The Eckerd drugstore chain is taking part in a discount prescription program started by drugmakers and will begin offering discounts on more than 1,000 generic drugs. [C5.]    Stock Markets Rally Broadly  The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 143.64 points, or 1.7 percent, at 8,542.13. The Nasdaq climbed 50.18 points, or 3.7 percent, to 1,411.52.

Sony hopes to change all that with the PictureStation, which can make getting finished prints as easy as going to an automated teller machine for cash.     The Sony PictureStation even resembles an A.T.M., but instead of an opening for deposit envelopes, the unit has slots that accept popular digital-camera memory cards like Compact Flash, SmartMedia and Memory Stick, plus slots for photos stored on a CD-ROM or diskette. The PictureStation will recognize and display the images on the card or disk and display a preview of each photo on its screen. A touch screen lets you select the pictures you want, the size (3 by 5 inches, 4 by 6, or 5 by 7) and the number of prints. A high-speed digital printer in the unit then creates high-quality prints on the spot, in either matte or glossy finish.  "

Deutsche Asset Management, which owns about 28 percent of Harvey Nichols, said it planned to vote against Mr. Poon's offer of &#163;2.50 ($3.91) a share, because it was too low. Dickson Concepts owns 50 percent of Harvey Nichols, and Mr. Poon needs the approval of shareholders holding two-thirds of the stock. One option open to Mr. Poon is to restructure the transaction. He could first offer to buy the remaining 50 percent of the shares he does not already own. Once they are in his possession, he could then take the company private. Such a structure would require a lower threshold of shareholder approval. After buying Harvey Nichols in 1991, Mr. Poon engineered a turnaround before selling shares to the public in 1996 for &#163;2.70 ($4.22). More recently, sales and profits have been disappointing. Harvey Nichols said on Friday that profit for the six months ended Sept. 28 fell 35 percent, to &#163;3 million ($4.7 million).   Suzanne Kapner (NYT)    "
