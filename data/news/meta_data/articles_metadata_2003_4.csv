The study will probably intensify debate about the companies, which have come under heavy fire for their accounting practices and for the special treatment they receive as government-sponsored corporations. [Page C8.]    Ford Revamps Visteon Arrangement  Ford Motor announced a sweeping restructuring of its relationship with Visteon, its main parts supplier. Ford will take a pretax charge of $1.65 billion against fourth-quarter earnings to assume the retirement health care liabilities of Visteon employees. Ford also raised its 2003 earnings estimates. For the year, the company said earnings should be $1.05 to $1.10 a share, up from its previous estimate of 95 cents to $1.05 a share. The estimates exclude the Visteon charge and other items.

The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 4.28 points to 1,092.94, also a 19-month high, and the Nasdaq composite rose 4.78 points to 1,955.80. [C8.]    Fund Company Puts Three on Leave  Franklin Resources, the asset management company known for its Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, said in a regulatory filing that it had placed a trader and two officers on leave after finding that they had rapidly traded fund shares. [C12.]    Novell Registers Unix Copyrights  Novell has quietly registered for the copyrights on many versions of Unix code that the SCO Group says it owns, further muddying the water surrounding the dispute that has embroiled the Unix world for almost a year. [C5.]    Linus Torvalds, creator of the popular Linux operating system, defended his work as not always lovely but original -- and certainly not copied, as SCO Group has asserted.

The toy business has long been as cutthroat as a fully engaged Captain Jack Sparrow, and for the last several years Wal-Mart, Target and other discounters have captured ground from toy retailers during the prime toy-buying period around the holidays.      This fall, Wal-Mart's toy prices were the cheapest across the board, according to the Prudential Equity Group, which compares prices for 50 top-selling toys during the holidays. While Wal-Mart's share has been growing each year, Toys ''R'' Us, the country's biggest toy chain, had long held an advantage on prices in the Prudential survey.     Another survey, by Goldman Sachs, also found Wal-Mart increasingly undercutting the prices of Toys ''R'' Us as the holidays drew closer. The Goldman survey examined prices on a different assortment, ranging from an 87-cent Hot Wheels car (87 cents) to an Xbox console ($179.99), through last Tuesday.      The toys-only retailers are feeling the pain. Last month, Toys ''R'' Us said that its losses per share, already expected to be about 9 cents, would be twice that, at 18 cents. The company also said it would close 182 free-standing Kids ''R'' Us stores as well as its Imaginarium chain, leaving it with 1,451 stores.     KB Toys, a privately held toy retailer, has also indicated it is struggling; it missed a payment to manufacturers on Dec. 12. And FAO, the owner of the F.A.O. Schwarz, Zany Brainy and Right Start chains, filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 9.      Wal-Mart had the lowest prices on 92 percent of the toys surveyed, compared with a 77 percent reading in the survey last year, a Prudential analyst, Mark Rowen, said in the report. The prices at Toys ''R'' Us were the cheapest on 4 percent of the toys, tied with Target, which also increased its assortment of toys in time for this holiday season. Buying every single toy in the survey cost $1,692.62 at Wal-Mart, compared with $1,781.48 at Toys ''R'' Us and $1,877.17 at Target.      The Goldman Sachs survey found that the prices at Toys ''R'' Us and Target were neck-and-neck in early November, with Target leading by Nov. 24. However, by the time the Goldman Sachs analyst, Matthew J. Fassler, made a third trip to the stores on Dec. 16, Wal-Mart had surged ahead, with prices that were 2 percent lower than the average of the three chains.      ''Wal-Mart appears to be far more aggressive on price this year than last, when our holiday 2002 survey revealed that Toys ''R'' Us offered the cheapest basket of toys over all,'' Mr. Rowen wrote in his report. He urged investors to de-emphasize Toys ''R'' Us stock, forecasting that its share price, then nearly $13, would fall to $10.     Perhaps as significant as the prices, the discounters are selling more of the big-ticket toys than they traditionally have, putting a tighter squeeze on Toys ''R'' Us and FAO. The most expensive toy in the Prudential survey, the Barbie Cook With Me Smart Kitchen priced at $129.99 at Toys ''R'' Us, is available at Wal-Mart for $118.64 and at Target for $129.99. On the Web site, Walmart.com, a Big Bratz Yasmin doll is $79.88 with an offer to ship the toy for 97 cents, and a Tyco Monster Jam remote-control truck, nicknamed Grave Digger, is $99.62, with shipping available for 97 cents. An air hockey table, the Sportcraft Hat Trick III, is $234.68, although there was no guarantee it could be delivered before Dec. 24.      In some cases, the Prudential survey found, expensive toys are only pennies apart in the three stores. The Leap Frog Leapster, an electronic learning game released this year and considered a top seller, is $79.99 at Toys ''R'' Us, $79.84 at Wal-Mart and $79.99 at Target.      ''We have always carried toys that our customers have wanted,'' said Karen Burk, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart. ''It's all based on our store-of-the-community concept. There is going to be a slight difference from store to store, based on the concept.''      For Wal-Mart, which has increasingly opened stores in more affluent suburban areas in recent years, serving a more demanding clientele means stocking an escalating array of toys. Even Wal-Mart's private-label toys, the ones it orders itself instead of relying on a manufacturer like Mattel or Hasbro, suggest a better-off Wal-Mart shopper than in past years. On the company's Web site, a toy Hummer vehicle, available in yellow or black, has been a top seller, Ms. Burk added, priced at just under $100.     The Prudential survey took into account prices on display during store visits as well as those shown in store circulars and online. It found that not all prices were consistent across the various outlets or across the country. All three stores had prices that ranged from highest in the survey to lowest, showing that none of them can claim to have the lowest price on every toy. Perhaps they suspect that few are likely to navigate all three chains in search of the best price on everything.      Susan McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Toys ''R'' Us, said the company would release holiday sales data on Jan. 8. ''We've been really competitive in pricing this year,'' she said. ''It's easy to have a price that's very low on something you do not have. One thing we've promised is that we're going to be in stock the longest.''      The Goldman Sachs survey found that Wal-Mart had items out of stock more often than Toys ''R'' Us or Target. There were exceptions, of course, like the Lego area, where the offer from Toys ''R'' Us to ''buy one, get the second for 50 percent off'' left shelves almost empty, Mr. Fassler wrote in his report.      It was more of the same at other stores, he added. ''We found Target fairly picked over'' during the December visit, he wrote. ''Most prices were not visible or difficult to find, and we found certain items stacked high on storage racks while their shelf spots remained empty.'' Wal-Mart had experienced a stampede, it appeared: ''Wal-Mart's toy area was the most visibly in disarray and shopped through; even Wal-Mart's board game display at the very front of the store was almost entirely empty.''      Wal-Mart rang up about 20 percent of total toy sales in the United States by dollar this year, the same proportion held by Toys ''R'' Us a decade ago, said Tom Goetzinger, a senior analyst for Morningstar. Toys ''R'' Us's share has slipped to 17 percent, he added, calling it ''a pretty big shift.'' Ms. McLaughlin said that share had risen over the last five years, and that in the still-fragmented toy business, ''there is still plenty of share to be gained.''     Mr. Rowen would not comment beyond the report, citing Prudential policy, and Mr. Fassler was not available. But other analysts said Wal-Mart began cutting prices in October, and that Target widened its array of toys for the holiday season while cutting prices sharply as well.      ''Relative to a year ago, Target has really expanded their toy offering and lowered the prices for toys,'' said Bill Sims, a retail analyst for Citigroup. Target appeared to have gone out on a discounting limb in some cases, selling the Barbie as Swan Lake doll for $15.88, compared with $16.43 at Wal-Mart and $16.99 at Toys ''R'' Us; and the Lego NBA Ultimate Arena for $77.99, compared with $88.88 at Wal-Mart and $79.99 at Toys ''R'' Us, the Prudential report found.      Lena Klofstad, a spokeswoman for Target, called its prices competitive and said they were ''changing as the season progresses.'' She confirmed that more toys were being featured because of the holiday shopping season. ''There was a concerted effort to make sure we had the toys in our stores that our guests were going to want,'' she said. Bratz dolls ($29.99 in the Prudential survey for one called Winter Wonderland), board games like Cranium ($14.99, compared with $14.73 at Wal-Mart and $16.99 at Toys ''R'' Us), and the Tonka Jr. Mighty Dump Truck ($7.99 at Target, $7.97 at Toys ''R'' Us and $7.96 at Wal-Mart) are among the selections.     Both Target and Wal-Mart have lowered prices to the point where they may be losing money on individual toys, some analysts said, but do so because they expect toy shoppers to buy less heavily discounted products in other departments as well.      ''From Toys ''R'' Us's perspective, how do you compete when your nearest two competitors don't have to be profitable?'' Mr. Sims said.      He thinks Toys ''R'' Us will find a way to survive, possibly with the help of toy makers who are anxious to have alternatives to Wal-Mart and Target.
