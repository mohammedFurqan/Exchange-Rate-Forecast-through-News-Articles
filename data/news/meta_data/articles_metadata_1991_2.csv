Meeting in Luxembourg, community foreign ministers said the move would result in ending a five-year-old ban on imports of gold coins, iron and steel from South Africa. Last December, the ministers revoked a prohibition against new investments in South Africa."

Altogether, however, the week's events showed that the decline in rates is occurring very slowly and that inflation is still a worrisome problem. These factors could lead to disappointments in some stock markets.   In Germany, Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the central bank, said he would leave the Bundesbank by the end of October, ending a reign of more than 11 years as the most powerful central banker in Europe."

Friends praised its husky tone as soothing. Some even called it sexy.

He found that she was breathing too fast, which caused her vocal cords to form nodules, small bumps that prevent vocal cords from closing properly. After three months of voice therapy, Ms. Whitney says, clients no longer offer her lozenges and tissues. ""My voice sounds much healthier,"" she says. ""I'm not hoarse anymore."""

But such hopes have given way to the more humble belief that the best they can do is to state what they think are the odds on various possible developments (""scenarios"" in the current economic jargon). The problem of macroeconomic forecasting has been made even more difficult by the complex interactions between national economies and the world economy.   Prof. Rudiger Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says the world economy is now in the midst of a ""significant slowdown,"" with outright recession in the Anglo-Saxon countries and minimal growth in Europe, except Germany. Only Asia is keeping up the momentum of world growth, but even there Japan's growth rate is slipping below 4 percent."

As a result, many companies are truncating the classroom parts of management training and are instead opting for ""action learning,"" a hybrid technique in which classroom training is immediately followed by sessions in which the trainees use what they learn to tackle actual projects and problems that their companies have identified as requiring attention."

PC-compatible computers, recently introduced a chip called the i486SX, a scaled-down version of its i486 chip. To create the i486SX, Intel engineers disabled the powerful, built-in math processing component of the i486, which is used for intensive computational chores like extremely complex financial analysis and three-dimensional graphics. They also made the i486SX operate more slowly than its i486 sibling. In return, computer makers can buy the i486SX chip for half the cost of the i486.   For now, computers built around the i486SX chip fill a gap between the fastest 386-based computers and the powerful i486-based machines. But whether the gap is strategically important to businesses is unclear."

But the Chrysler Corporation took that risk by recently allowing dealers, journalists and others onto its test track to give them a glimpse of the 1993 mid-size models on which Chrysler is pinning its hopes for a recovery.    The slump in car sales and the national recession, which coincide with yet another big push by the Japanese for American market share, is squeezing Detroit and causing a torrent of cash to flow out the door. All of the auto makers are cutting costs and conserving resources. What they are struggling to avoid, though, are any deep cuts that would delay or eliminate new products. A Matter of Perceptions     Chrysler, like the others in the Big Three, does not want investors, suppliers or lenders to get the idea that it is paring spending for new models, a perception that would only worsen its problems on the showroom floor.   The pressure to spend, even when money is scarce, is a matter of market share for the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and a matter of survival for Chrysler. All three are striving to avoid having their need to save money force them into canceling or delaying important vehicle projects. G.M. on Monday announced plans to float an issue of preference stock to raise $600 million, partly to pay for future vehicle models, among them eight new-car and thee new-truck models in the next year.    ""Spending for new products must go on in good times and bad,"" said James B. Fitzpatrick, a G.M. vice president for communications and marketing. ""It is our lifeblood."" Cash generated internally at G.M. has shrunk from $10.08 billion in 1987 to an estimated $5.27 billion this year, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.    Japanese auto makers can develop a new vehicle in far less time than Detroit can, and they are invading market niches in the United States where they have never been before. Today, for example, Nissan showed journalists its first mini-van, named the Quest. It was designed in California and will be built at a Ford plant near Cleveland starting next April. Last year, Nissan withdrew from the market its Axxess station wagon that was meant to attract mini-van buyers but was a flop.    American auto makers know they cannot compete unless they compress their normal five-year product-gestation period to three years, like the Japanese, and bring out more new cars more frequently. Indeed, the most scathing criticism that could be leveled at the American auto industry would be to say that it was mortgaging the future by scrimping on new-product development.   But new products take money. Depending on the extent of the redesign, the cost of bringing a new car to dealer lots ranges from $500 million to $1 billion.    While G.M. has been able to keep most models on schedule, it has acknowledged a few delays. Rumors among parts suppliers say G.M. has delayed its redesigned S-10 Blazer utility vehicle to 1995, from 1994.  Taking on More Debt     As for Ford, it borrowed $800 million in the first quarter of the year, raising its debt to $8.2 billion; a year ago, debt stood at $4.4 billion. Ford's debt-to-equity ratio on March 31 was 38 percent, compared with 16 percent a year ago. Ford is trying to keep most future models on schedule, but analysts and suppliers say it has delayed the redesign of the Taurus and the Sable models for one year, to 1995.    After Ford announced a first-quarter loss of $884 million, David N. McCammon, vice president-finance, said projects ""are basically intact, but we always are making timing adjustments"" to cut costs and looking for ways ""to get a dollar's worth of new products for every 80 cents we spend.""    Chrysler, which has suffered critical losses and has little financial cushion, has the least borrowing power among the Big Three, the lowest relative stock price, and the least ability to put money into new products. But Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., said Chrysler more than any other American auto maker might be trying to pull spending forward.    Perhaps because of its well-publicized financial weakness, the No. 3 auto maker must go to the greatest lengths to prove that its $3 billion in cost-cutting is not hampering development of new models. The company renegotiated a $1.5 billion line of credit after the lowering of its debt ratings made borrowing from the public too expensive.    ""The fear is that Chrysler is cutting into muscle and bone,"" said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. ""But I hope not, because I love the way the L/H looks."" He was referring to the code name for Chrysler's 1993 mid-size sedan, which will be sold by the Eagle, Dodge and Chrysler divisions; it will be built, starting next year, at a factory in Bramalea, Ontario.    Other Chrysler vehicles badly need replacement, too. The full-size pickup truck -- referred to by some Chrysler engineers as ""Festus,"" the grizzled codger in the ""Gunsmoke"" television western -- has not been redesigned for more than 15 years. Chrysler is planning to replace it in 1993.  No Profits, No Cash     In economically healthy times auto makers pay part of their new-product costs with cash from current sales. But with no profits, auto makers must increase borrowings or sell equity. In the last six months, the Big Three have been forced to trim dividends and drastically cut costs to strengthen balance sheets enough to finance new-product spending.    One-time expenses have also been a drain on cash. G.M., for example, was obligated on March 1 to buy $600 million worth of its class H stock from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as part of the renegotiated terms of the sale of Hughes Aircraft to G.M. in 1985.    The three-year labor contract negotiated in the fall with the United Automobile Workers union has become a huge financial burden as well. Under its terms, the Big Three must pay most workers even if they are laid off, a situation that makes labor costs akin to a fixed expense. In previous recessions, labor expenses went down as sales and production dropped, allowing auto makers to keep losses in check.    In 1982, under an earlier labor agreement, the industry was operating at only 62 percent of capacity, yet auto makers were breaking even. But last year, utilization was at 78 percent and still the industry lost about $5 billion in North America, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.  The Cost of Competition     Of course, foreign imports and transplants -- Japanese cars made in America -- were not as much of a factor during the last recession. Vicious competition is hurting the Big Three's ability to maintain prices. Even with much lower production, the auto makers have been forced to continue offering large rebates on most car and truck models -- another drain on cash.    Shorter development cycles for cars like Chrysler's L/H model should help to cut costs, analysts say. Chrysler will have brought the L/H out in 42 months, a 30 percent reduction in the typical development time, helping produce a 25 percent cut in development costs, according to an estimate by Sanford C. Bernstein.    Chrysler believes the length of the cycle will be about 39 months, said Glen Gardner, who heads the project; that compares with the Japanese average of about 36 months. ""The trick is going to be to get the rest of our projects on this schedule,"" he said."

But the latest version of an annual survey of client-agency relationships suggests that the appeal of the concept, known as performance-based compensation, may be waning.   A preview of the 1991 Salz Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations showed a surprising shift in attitudes toward such compensation practices, said Nancy L. Salz, an industry consultant and author. She is head of Nancy L. Salz Consulting, a New York-based firm that specializes in counseling companies on ways to improve relations with their agencies."

Randsworth Trust P.L.C., which JMB bought in 1989 with the pension funds' help, stumbled last year because of Britain's high interest rates and falling property values. Last June, JMB told about 15 of the funds that Randsworth was paying out too much on its floating-rate debt and that the partnership would need some fresh capital. JMB got some of the money, but it has not proved enough. Another Infusion Needed     JMB is once again asking some of the funds to help recapitalize the investment because although British rates have fallen, appraised property values have been falling faster. The Randsworth portfolio was bought at a high point in the London market, and the idea was to sell a few big properties to pay down the debt used for the purchase and provide working capital. But property values started to slide, and the partners decided not to sell into a falling market, which meant that the tens of millions of dollars needed would have to come from somewhere else."

Undeveloped land is often difficult to finance, particularly on such short notice. But Ms. Blayney has a solution: using a private banker. The client's financial background is strong enough to meet the banker's guidelines, Ms. Blayney said, and a check should be available in a matter of days.   Getting loans quickly and with a minimum of red tape is perhaps the most useful service provided by private banking departments, which exist at most commercial banks and some savings banks. At their most elaborate, the departments are designed to pull all the disparate resources of a bank together in one place to help clients with all of their financial needs. In return for being assigned to a specific banker and given access to a range of financial experts, the client is expected to generate a certain amount of business or pay a minimum annual fee."

Consider a hypothetical case, raised recently in parliamentary debate: A Jewish shopkeeper lost his store in 1939, when Hungary's quasi-fascist Government began to curtail Jewish property rights. The store was then owned by a Swabian German, who in turn lost it shortly after World War II, when many ethnic Germans, held collectively accountable for the Nazi occupation in 1944, were driven from Hungary."

Whittaker, the Carnegie-Mellon University professor considered one the nation's foremost robot designers. First came the demonstration for Government officials of the Ambler, Dr. Whittaker's 19-foot tall, six-legged robot designed to explore Mars someday. In a rock garden on the Carnegie-Mellon campus here, Ambler stepped over high boulders and avoided holes, a formidable achievement for a robot. ""It was one of those holy moments,"" said Dr. Whittaker, 42, a former Marine whose friends call him Red. ""It was mystical to see the Ambler get up and go. My heart was in my throat.""   Then one afternoon a few weeks later, in a less formal demonstration, Dr. Whittaker and his colleagues took a van crammed with electronics out onto Pittsburgh's streets. While a human driver controlled the vehicle, a computer and a laser vision system in the back ""watched"" the van follow the white lines up and down streets. Then the driver let go of the steering wheel and the computer took over, flawlessly steering the van down the street, staying in its own lane. This, too, was a significant accomplishment for a robot, since tasks seemingly as simple as guiding a vehicle down a straight line have long confounded machines built to mimic the most elementary actions of humans. ""At that point, there was nothing to do but break out the beer and celebrate,"" Dr. Whittaker said."

Increasing class conflict, the emergence of a revolutionary socialist movement and appeals from groups of Catholic workers and thinkers moved Pope Leo XIII to write this document. The encyclical defended private property, attacked socialism and reflected a medieval ideal of a static society where rich and poor carried out mutual duties. But Pope Leo also condemned the ""inhumanity of employers and unbridled greed of competitors"" and ""the yoke almost of slavery"" laid on ""unnumbered masses"" of propertyless workers. He called for government regulation of working hours and conditions, and his endorsement of the right of workers to form their own associations was a charter for Catholics to support the labor movement.    1931: ""Quadragesimo Anno"" (""In the Fortieth Year,"" usually given the English title ""On Reconstructing the Social Order""). Pope Pius IX marked the anniversary of ""Rerum Novarum"" with an equally impassioned condemnation of the concentrated power of capitalist owners and an equally complete rejection of socialism. The encyclical recommended the establishment of associations or councils bringing management and labor together. Although similar proposals were made under liberal auspices, fascist leaders in Italy, Austria, Portugal and elsewhere claimed papal approval for the structures they used to bring the economy under state coordination."

Millionaires many times over, the Kriebles are the Rockefellers of the glue business, but they are having trouble getting a premium for their shares of the family business, the Loctite Corporation. And no one except their advisers seems to care.    Loctite, the company that Vernon K. Krieble founded in 1953, has prospered under the managers that his descendants installed six years ago. Today, the company rakes in tens of millions of dollars a year in profits from selling high-performance adhesives and other products to consumers and more important, to industrial users like car companies. Last year, for instance, Loctite earned $67.4 million on sales of $555 million.    And yet, almost inexplicably for the founding family of a superbly run company, six of Mr. Krieble's descendants notified the Securities and Exchange Commission in March that they wanted out. They want their 9.8 percent stake in Loctite sold at a premium over its $115 million market value and will be exploring their options, they warn.   Equally strange, the company's stock has since dropped from around $35 before their filings to $32, a contrary move for a company seemingly in play.    One answer is that the market correctly sees the family's virtual powerlessness to force the company to put itself up for sale. It is not that the company has lots of takeover defenses; it does not. The predicament is entirely of the family's own doing. Six years ago, just after handing the company to Kenneth W. Butterworth, the current chairman and chief executive, the Kriebles sold $87.5 million worth of stock to Henkel, a German chemical company, helping it to accumulate a 26.3 percent stake in Loctite. Family members also gave Henkel the right of first refusal over their remaining holdings, a right that Henkel has made clear it would exercise.    ""Potential buyers look at Henkel's sizable position and the probability that Henkel could block an unfriendly bid and say 'We'll pass,' "" said Robert Bartels, a chemicals analyst at William Blair & Company, who thinks the Kriebles are ""grasping at straws.""    Another explanation for the stock's mysterious drop is that the market is wondering what it is the Kriebles and specifically Frederick B. Krieble, the only Krieble still on Loctite's board, know about Loctite's prospects that it has not already figured out.    Certainly, without more information about why the Kriebles are selling, the market can hardly be blamed for its bearish reaction. Especially since some of the Kriebles are getting on in years and there are usually good estate-planning reasons for keeping valuable stock in the family: children are generally not taxed on any capital gains that predate their inheritance.    The family did not return phone calls left last week at their business office in Hartford. Their advisers at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore and at the investment firm First Boston profess to know little about their motives, other than the proceeds from a sale would obviously help the older members enjoy their old age.   Robert H. Krieble, the son of the founder and Loctite's chairman until 1986, is understood to be bent on using his riches to help spread glasnost in the Soviet Union, although it is not clear how.   What the other relatives plan to do with the money is more of a mystery. Frederick B. Krieble, Robert's son, is a resident of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a tax haven. Helen K. Fusscas, Robert's daughter, is an art dealer in Hartford and the wife of a state representative, James Peter Fusscas.    Sentimentality is apparently not an issue. ""It's clearly not a family company anymore,"" said Joseph Mitchell a lawyer at Reid & Priest. He represents Gladys Krieble Delmas, the civic-minded daughter of Loctite's founder and the only Krieble who is not part of the dissident group -- the dissident dissident, so to speak. And while she would consider selling her 2.4 percent stake for the right price, she apparently sees no reason to pay Cravath or First Boston to hustle the shares.    Another possibility the advisers do not entirely dismiss is that the family may be worried about the recent softening in Loctite's unit sales even while dollar sales have climbed. Mr. Butterworth says he is confident about the company's future, but when pressed said: ""Yes, we are in the middle of a recession that's affected 75 percent of the business we do. And so in the recent five or six months, there has been a slowing down of unit sales.""    So far, the Kriebles' strategy seems designed to scare the board into thinking that they might get angry and sell their holdings to the first available suitor knowing full well that Henkel would snap up the shares and increase its holdings to 40 percent. Henkel would then be within a whisker of gaining control without having paid a premium for it.    The other option is to seek a buyer who would pay such a fancy price for the company that even Henkel would part with an investment it has described as ""a core holding."" That might be tough. The past six years' performance suggests that this management knows how to extract value from Loctite's assets as well as anybody.   Certainly, both Henkel and Loctite's management feel confident that Loctite's independent directors can safely ignore the family's threats. ""We do not feel forced in any way to take any action,"" Mr. Butterworth said on Thursday after a board meeting in which the directors discussed the latest threat. ""We believe the company is well managed, and nothing they've suggested will offer the shareholders a better deal than what we can offer by just continuing to manage it.""    The family cannot count on Wall Street for support either. ""This management is doing everything right,"" said Stuart Pulvirent, a chemicals analyst for Lehman Brothers. ""I'm not sure somebody lends all that much to it who comes in from the outside."""

Most analysts had come to expect in recent weeks that the decline would exceed the fourth quarter's 1.6 percent annual pace, and today's report, which showed a 2.8 percent rate of decline in the January-March period, was not seen as significantly worsening prospects for pulling out of recession.

And interest-rate risk increases over time. So investors who tie up their money in long-term bond funds should get returns that are markedly better than the returns of shorter-term funds.   That, however, has not happened in high-quality corporate bond funds. For the last five years, there has been virtually no difference in the returns of the long-term A-rated corporate bond funds and intermediate bond funds, the bulk of whose holdings are comparable in quality to the A-rated funds'. After 7 and 10 years, the spread widens somewhat, but it is still less than one percentage point."

Most approaches to dealing with the disposal of solid waste have been administrative and legislative. Some states now ban yard waste from landfills; others bar home appliances to conserve scarce space. Maine even banned the brick-shaped drink boxes popular with children on the ground that the boxes' paper-plastic-metal foil composition made them difficult to recycle."

This caused the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans, to drop to 5 3/4 percent from 6 percent. The funds rate is considered the basic cost of credit because most other interest rates are scaled upward from it.

The killing of the American, Michael DeVine, who was found June 9 along a jungle road with his hands tied and his head partly severed, has become the defining point in relations between Washington and Guatemala City.    The Administration cut off its $3.3 million annual military aid program in December to protest the army's refusal to interrogate two ranking officers implicated in the case.   Senior State Department officials said the new President, Jorge Serrano Elias, had made important strides in bringing the case to trial in the last few weeks. They cautiously expressed the hope that prosecutions of officers in the killing would open the way for the United States to enlist the Guatemalan Army in a coordinated effort to interdict cocaine flown from Colombia.   Melvyn Levitsky, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, said Mexico had become so successful in interdicting cocaine flights over the last six months that many traffickers now land in Guatemala. From there, they either refuel or unload to ship their drugs by land through Mexico into the United States.    A senior State Department official said American military Awacs surveillance aircraft that fly over the Caribbean and the Pacific could share information on drug flights with the Guatemalan Army, which could then carry troops in helicopters to the landing sites. In turn, he said United States officials could benefit from information collected by the army's spy network to identify clandestine landing strips and opium poppy fields.   The United States has reported in recent years that Guatemala had became a major producer of opium poppies. An aerial eradication campaign in which the law enforcement officials of the two nations cooperated destroyed most of the crop in 1990, the State Department says.    ""Until we have a military relationship again, we are hindered in our ability to help them in their drug effort,"" Mr. Levitsky said. ""The DeVine case is one of the major impediments to full cooperation.""   Officials in the State and Defense Departments are divided over whether the United States should cooperate with the Guatemalan Army, given the persistent allegations that it has directed death-squad activities.   Mr. DeVine, who was 49 years old and from Belleville, Ill., and his wife, Carol, had lived in Guatemala for almost 20 years.   After her husband was killed, Mrs. DeVine hired an American private investigator who found witnesses who said they had seen five soldiers and one peasant driving in the white pickup truck reportedly used as the getaway vehicle. The investigator said he had found that the truck belonged to the army base at the nearby town of Flores. The vehicle was found back at the barracks, repainted red, he said.   No motive has been established in the killing, although a United States Senate aide monitoring the case has speculated that Mr. DeVine might have come across a poppy field protected by the army on one of his hiking trips.    The case appeared to be stalled until last month, when the five soldiers -- who were identified and have been held since October -- volunteered to give depositions in which they declared their innocence but implicated two officers and seven other soldiers.    United States officials said the depositions say the soldiers either overheard the nine new suspects preparing for the crime, or saw them leaving the base to commit the killing.    A military judge has ordered that the two officers named in the depositions be compelled to testify.    A State Department official credited President Serrano with following up on the depositions by transfering judicial proceedings from remote Peten Province to the capital, ""presumably to permit enhanced scrutiny.""    A Guatemalan official who is monitoring the case said, ""We are committed to getting to the bottom of this."""

In 1980 it had only two million square feet of office space, in contrast to 33 million square feet in Boston.  But to the surprise of some and the chagrin of others, Cambridge came on strong in the last decade, and it is now bearing up under the recession more successfully than its larger neighbor across the river. With total office space of 9.5 million square feet, its rent levels are off only about 15 percent, brokers say, with a vacancy rate of 13 percent."

The company employs 62,000 people in Britain, where it operates 291 stores. It also employs 13,000 people at 389 stores abroad."

The congress still avoids personal attacks on Inkatha's president, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who in turn expresses sympathy for Nelson Mandela, with whom he worked out the peace agreement in Durban on Jan. 29. But the congress accuses Inkatha members of plotting with the security forces to cause the latest violence, while Inkatha plays up the congress's alliance with the South African Communist Party as proof of a conspiracy to seize and monopolize power."

If those companies were permanently closed, industry experts say, many of the state safety nets, called insurance guarantee funds, could not meet the big financial demands suddenly made on them. Weaknesses Are Cited    In addition to arguing that the programs lack resources, critics point out that the programs are not run or guaranteed by state governments, that they are not true ""funds"" because they do not keep money in reserve, and that they are limited in how much they can ask each year from surviving insurers."

The system, developed by Computer Design Inc. of Grand Rapids, is designed to run on commercially available computer work stations. ""Normally, designers have to produce fabric one year ahead of time,"" said Emory Shyong, senior software engineer and the machine's inventor. ""With this, they can do it one month before the line of clothing is released. They can catch the fashion trend."""

Saturn will not report how many of the replacement vehicles will be among the new-car sales reported by its parent company, the General Motors Corporation, during the next month or so, according to a Saturn spokesman, Mark Tanner. ""We're not going to know that breakout,"" Mr. Tanner said. If supplied over a month's time, 1,100 vehicles would raise Saturn sales for that month by about one-fifth."

As a result, the region, the home district of President Roh Tae Woo, could now be mistaken for anywhere in the Silicon Valley of California. But a recent chemical spill that some critics link to South Korea's ""industrialize at all cost"" policies is causing the area and the nation much anguish."

So why is the entire telecommunications world so enamored of John D. Goeken?

Now, he is overseeing construction of a fully modern bottling plant for one of capitalism's flagships: the Coca-Cola Company.   Mr. Schulze's swift conversion from Communist bureaucrat to technical director of the Weimar plant is no accident. It is a result of Coca-Cola's agility and resourcefulness in making a big move into the eastern German market. While most Western companies remain reluctant to dip into the economically troubled region, the soft-drink giant plunged in even before German unification. Now, Coke plans to spend $450 million over the next two years, one of its largest foreign investments anywhere to date."

An even number of cylinders allows the up-and-down motion of each piston to be offset by another piston. An engine with an odd number of cylinders tends to vibrate more. Nevertheless, a few companies have used engines with three or five cylinders. Honda's new four-door Vigor comes with a five-cylinder engine (right) so as to pack more horsepower in a small engine compartment. Honda engineers dampened the vibration by careful timing of each piston's stroke. Their design also incorporates hydraulic devices at points where the engine is attached to the car's frame.

The crowds will be sparse, the language arcane and most of the action will take place inside a big, boxy computer. The goal is to design a computer that is more than 1,000 times faster than the most potent current models -- a supercomputer capable of running more than a trillion mathematical calculations each second.    The Intel Corporation will rev up its preliminary entry, known as the Touchstone Delta, in a demonstration today at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The Touchstone does not achieve the teraflop speeds that Intel seeks, but it is four times faster than Intel's present supercomputer, a parallel system composed of an array of microprocessors that break apart large problems and perform hundreds of simultaneous calculations."

Alan Whitney, a spokesman for the agency, said officials reduced the value of BankAmerica's bid because it was ""nonconforming to the ground rules of the overall transaction."" He would not elaborate on the ways in which the bid did not meet the Government's guidelines, but he did say that when it was analyzed it turned out to be worth less than the $125 million in stock and cash offered by Fleet.   Mr. Whitney said the F.D.I.C. might soon release details about its analysis of the bids. The agency's deliberations are not public.   BankAmerica declined to comment."

Augusto Pinochet.    Calling for a return to power by the military and shouting insults at the democratically elected Government of President Patricio Aylwin, hundreds of supporters of Chile's far-right political party, the Independent Democratic Union, flocked to a memorial service in downtown Santiago for the adviser, Jaime Guzman, who was killed on Monday evening.    ""Pinochet, Pinochet!"" the crowd called. ""Aylwin killed him! Aylwin killed him!""    Mr. Guzman was gunned down as he left the Catholic University Law School in Santiago, where he was a professor. Though doctors at the Military Hospital tried to save him, he died three hours later.  A Crisis for Government     Mr. Guzman, 44 years old, was legal adviser to the Pinochet military junta and played a central role in writing the new Constitution that the general established in 1980.    Though acts of political violence have been on the rise for a number of weeks, the shooting of Mr. Guzman is by far the most serious and politically explosive to date, since it is the closest that terrorists have reached to General Pinochet's inner circle of current and former advisers.    It also creates a crisis for the year-old Aylwin Government, which many Chileans accuse of being soft on terrorism and unprepared to cope with the rise in terrorist attacks. Moreover, it complicates an already touchy political climate for Mr. Aylwin, who plans to leave on an 18-day tour of Europe on Saturday.    A month ago, Mr. Aylwin made public a human rights report that essentially blamed General Pinochet for the killing or disappearance of more than 2,000 Chileans during his 17-year rule, which began with a coup in 1973. But while blaming the army commander, it went no further. It could not force investigations or prosecutions of police, top army commanders or General Pinochet himself.  Nation Deeply Divided     General Pinochet and others on the right had warned before the release of the report that it would incite violence from the left.    The killing of Mr. Guzman and the demonstrations that followed showed how this country, just having returned to a democratic Government a year ago, remains deeply divided in its sentiments about General Pinochet's rule. While many Chileans acknowledge that under military rule there were abuses of human rights, they nevertheless add that the military Government restored law and order, which many now fear is being threatened.    And while only a minority seem to want a Pinochet comeback, the general's presence as army commander serves as a constant reminder of the fragility of the democratic process.    Today, two left-wing groups claimed responsibility for the killing, the Patriotic Front of Manuel Rodriguez and the Rebel and Popular Forces of Lautaro.    General Pinochet refused to talk to reporters today, saying only that he considered the killing an assassination rather than a random killing. Military officials said that their patience was wearing thin.    Mr. Aylwin, at a brief news conference, rejected charges by opposition political parties that his Government was unprepared to deal with terrorism and rejected calls that he cancel his European trip.    ""If I suspended this mission because of a terrorist act, that would be the equivalent of saying that the Government is at the mercy of the terrorists,"" Mr. Aylwin said."

Form B accounts, which preserved anonymity by allowing clients to conduct all bank transactions through a lawyer, notary or trust administrator, have become a notorious cover for money-laundering by drug-runners and corrupt dictators.     ""Existing Form B accounts will have to be replaced by a written statement on the identity of the real owner by Sept. 30, 1992, at the latest,"" the banking commission said in a statement.   Registrations of account holders will begin on July 1.   The commission said, however, that banks would still be allowed to open anonymous accounts if the deposits they held pertained to running legal proceedings such as divorces or inheritances.   At the end of 1989 Swiss banks held some 30,000 Form B accounts, according to commission statistics. Swiss banking secrecy laws, some of the tightest in the world, date back to 1934.   Until now the only deterrence for criminals has been a rule requiring a customer's legal representative to attest that the client was not attempting to conceal illegal activity.   The banking commission's vice director, Daniel Zuberbuehler, said, ""This statement that the account was not an attempt to conceal criminal activity was interpreted far too liberally.""   Two years ago Switzerland was shaken by a billion-dollar money-laundering scandal that forced the resignation of its Justice Minister.   Since then it has tried to improve its reputation as a haven for drug cartels and dictators such as the late Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, who was alleged to have stored billions of dollars of plundered state funds in Swiss banks."

It will be help toward self-help. We know that this is a worthwhile investment in peace and stability.""  Germany's Own Burden     The Germans are already committed to giving about $31 billion in grants and credits to the Soviet Union, in part because of Moscow's assent to the unification of Germany.

On another level, it is a battle for the right to succeed Mr. Gonzalez if and when he steps down."

But the overwhelming consensus is that the recovery will not amount to much. There is talk of a ""double dip"" downturn, and few expect strong growth.   The stock market, however, seems to have a different opinion, That contrary notion, of coming strength in the economy, is conveyed not just by the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average last week rose 113.59 points, to 3,027.50, setting a record and closing above 3,000 for the first time since April 17. It may also be significant that it is no longer the recession-resistant consumer stocks, like Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris, that are leading the charge.    Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, four are now at least 10 percent higher than they were when the average first closed over 3,000. All are big, grimy, cyclical stocks: Du Pont, Goodyear, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel. International Paper and Union Carbide have risen almost as much. If those moves are to make sense, then this economy needs than a weak recovery.    The bond market's refusal to rally may also be sending a signal of surprising economic strength,. The Federal Reserve has pushed short-term interest rates dopwn sharply, and American investors have taken the hint. Sales of mutural funds are booming.    And yet, as Fred Leiner, an economist at Continental Bank, points out, long-term interest rates have been stalled for six months, making minor moves but essentially going sideways. ""I'm concerned by some similarities with late 1986,"" he said. ""We see money pouring into bond funds, yet the bond market is unable to move higher. Those similarities suggest the market may move lower from these levels.""    In late 1986 and early 1987, he recalled, the bond market stalled while stocks leaped. Then bond prices crashed in the spring, and stock prices followed the fall.    This year, there are certainly plenty of reasons to doubt that the economy can rebound strongly. The debt overhang that helped to bring on this recession has not disappeared, and the Government's efforts to fight the recession have been limited by the severe fiscal problems brought on by the profligacy of the 1980's. It is hard to imagine a new boom in commercial construction.    Moreover, the evidence that the recession is ending, while persuasive to a lot of stock traders, is still limited,. The leading indicators have risen for three consecutive months, and factory orders turned up in April. Consumers tell pollsters the present is bad, but the future will be better, and they seem to translate those beliefs into cautious spending, not a panicky increase in savings. Stock market analysts note that secondary stocks, which were leaders in the winter rally, are lagging as summer begins, Their particiaption would make this rally a more impressive one.    But for all that, it is a fact that the economy usually finds a way to surprise the seers. A strong recovery this year would certianly qualify as a surprise. Perhaps, just perhaps, that is the current message of the markets.   "

In response to the states' advocacy of environmental matters, some industries are rushing to Washington, seeking uniform Federal rules.    Maine, for instance, has banned the multilayer boxes that are used for children's drinks because they are not recyclable.    California enforces stiffer standards for auto emissions than most states, and last year Massachusetts required vehicles to meet the California standards.    And in 1988, seven Northeastern states required oil companies to lessen the volatility of gasoline in summer months, seeking to reduce the amount of smog-forming chemicals in the atmosphere.   The Northeastern states, which have the most severe trash disposal problems, may soon take the lead in measures to reduce the generation of solid waste. Once again, the lack of action at the Federal level is inducing state level initiatives.    ""Over the past 10 years public opinion has become more supportive of the environment, and state officials have recognized it better than Federal officials,"" said Michael E. Kraft, a professor at the University of Wisconsin.    Students of government say the anti-regulation, free market orientation of the Reagan and Bush Administrations produced a power vacuum on some environmental issues.    ""Most state officials would argue that these things should be done at the Federal level, but they are not getting done,"" said Richard Dennison, a scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a research and litigation group based in New York. ""So you are going to have a lot of different approaches by the states, and you have to anticipate some failures along with successes.""    Fearful of a crazy-quilt pattern of state regulations, the consumer products industry recently asked the Federal Trade Commission to issue guidelines on the use of labels that claim environmental benefits.    The industry's action was prompted by different sets of regulations adopted by New York, California and Rhode Island, and by a challenge from a group of state attorneys general to the claims of some manufacturers.    The trade commission agreed last week to hold hearings on the issue, although it may act without pre-empting state laws.  National Standards Sought     ""Consumers, industry and state attorneys general want and need national environmental marketing guidelines,"" said John R. Cady, president of the National Association of Food Processors, which led the industry's appeal.    Without some Federal action, the industries' desire for uniformity could mean that a relatively few large states might set what amount to national standards. This appears to be the case with auto emissions, environmentalists and state officials say.    When Congress passed the Clean Air Act last year, it set new limits on emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. As it has in the past, Congress permitted California to issue more demanding standards and allowed other states to adopt the stiffer California standards.    Previously, other states were content with the Federal standards, but last year Massachusetts imposed the California standards, while New York officials issued a rule requiring that cars meet the California standards starting with 1993 models and have begun another proceeding to embrace the stiffer rules California will begin in 1995.    Michael Bradley, executive director of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a group of air-pollution officials, said as many as nine other states were considering adopting the California standards.    Officials and environmentalists say that if enough big states take this step, auto makers will be forced to improve the emissions performance of their cars across the board. ""If Texas joins New York and California, that is critical mass,"" said Thomas C. Jorling, the head of New York's Department of Environmental Conservation. ""And there is legislation pending now in Texas.""  Auto Makers Fight Back     The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which represents domestic auto makers, has filed suit in the state courts to block the New York action. ""We have a lot of problems"" with states regulating auto emissions, said Michael J. Stanton, the association's director of state relations.    ""What if what works in California does not work in New York because of differences in climate or type of gasoline?"" he asked rhetorically. ""How would that be handled?""    Mr. Stanton said differing state requirements also caused problems for dealers. ""If a dealer is in a Federal state, he could not sell across the state line if the next one had California rules,"" he said.    In some cases, action by states has led to tougher Federal standards. After seven of the eight Northeastern states changed the rules on gasoline volatility in 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency in 1989 adopted stiffer standards that will be fully effective in 1992.    Largely because of Reagan-era budget cuts, the E.P.A. has not addressed solid-waste problems other than to propose technical standards for landfills. And while the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which could address the problems of trash disposal, is due for revision in Congress, officials of environmental and industry groups say they expect little change soon.    So the Northeastern states may well take the lead by issuing rules to mandate recycling or to ban items like yard waste from landfills.    The states have already influenced national policy on toxic elements in packaging. The Coalition of Northeast Governors, comprising the Governors of the six New England States plus those of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, drafted model legislation in 1989 limiting the amounts of four toxic heavy metals in packaging, largely in printing inks. The legislation was adopted by six states in the region, as well as Iowa and Wisconsin.  Printing Ink Ingredients     Paul Volpe, technical director of the National Association of Printing Ink Manufacturers, said most producers were moving to comply with the rules regardless of their location. ""This has gone beyond the Northeast,"" he said.    Now the coalition is trying to unite state officials, environmentalists and industry representatives in a group called the Source Reduction Council to find ways of reducing the amount of packaging waste that goes to landfills. Packaging is coming in for special attention because it accounts for as much as one-third of all trash by weight and half by volume.    The group came up with a list of principles for preferred packaging, like small size and materials that can be recycled. But the negotiations bogged down on details of how to accomplish these goals, and late last year the environmental groups walked out.  11 States Weigh Action     Environmentalists and consumer advocates are backing legislation to ban packaging made of materials that cannot be recycled and re-used to reduce the amount of trash generated. According to the Environmental Action Foundation, a Washington-based environmental group, legislation to encourage recycling and reduce packaging waste is scheduled to be introduced in 11 states this year, including New York and New Jersey.    ""In the absence of Federal leadership, these 11 states are putting the packaging industry on notice that it is time to change,"" said Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste specialist with the organization.    The legislation is based on a proposal that was forced off the ballot in Massachusetts last year as a result of a challenge by a group of business interests. A similar proposal in Oregon was defeated.    In general, the bills would ban packaging by the mid-1990's that could not be re-used at least five times or that did not contain a certain level of recycled material.  Effort Called Simplistic     Jeffrey Nedelman, a vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, said industry would oppose the bills as an overly simplistic attempt to solve the trash disposal problem. ""Single-shot actions like bans and taxes do not accomplish the goal,"" he said. ""There are no silver bullets to kill the werewolf of solid waste.""    Robert Ruddock, a vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, said his group, which stopped the ballot initiative last year, would fight the measure in the Legislature. ""Recycling is a three-legged stool: collection, processing and marketing,"" he said. ""They would leap all the way to marketing and force a ban on packaging that does not meet their politically correct standards.""   Nevertheless, some state officials expect packaging and other environmental legislation to succeed. ""I think we will see action on packaging reduction, fugitive emissions and incinerator standards,"" Mr. Jorling said. ""National policy will evolve, but not in the most efficient way."""

Such drugs use monoclonal antibodies, highly specific replicas of the immune system's main defense agents, as targeting agents for drugs that treat the disease.

The French announcement was coupled with a package of ambitious proposals for arms control worldwide, including calls for the destruction of chemical weapons, a ban on production of biological weapons, reduction of nuclear arsenals and negotiations to limit the multi-billion-dollar trade in conventional armaments.   The plan was announced by President Francois Mitterrand just days after President Bush proposed a ban on weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. French officials said the two plans were complementary, although the French initiative favors a global approach to arms control.   Both proposals are to be taken up in Paris this month at a meeting of arms control experts from the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.   Officials said the French plan was conveyed to both President Bush and the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, over the weekend. French officials said Mr. Bush telephoned President Mitterrand to congratulate him on France's decision to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    The treaty, the subject of intensive negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in the mid-1960's, bans the export of nuclear weapons and nuclear arms technology. It emerged after the two superpowers and Britain in 1963 signed the first important arms control treaty, banning nuclear tests in outer space, the atmosphere and underwater. The treaty went into effect in 1968.  Protecting a Monopoly    The treaty was controversial because it sought to make permanent the nuclear weapons monopoly of those nations then possessing such weapons -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- and sought pledges from other countries not to acquire any. The treaty also committed the nuclear powers to work toward total nuclear disarmament and to help nonnuclear nations signing the accord in developing peaceful uses of nuclear energy.    From the start, France and China refused to sign the treaty, although France has always insisted that it has adhered to its provisions. In refusing to sign, President Charles de Gaulle maintained that France was not adequately consulted by Washington and Moscow when the treaty was being negotiated. But France's refusal was more broadly based, being part of de Gaulle's wish to signal that France had its own foreign and defense policy. The same reasoning led de Gaulle to pull France out of NATO's integrated military command in 1966.    Today, French political experts said that non-adherence to the treaty had not only lost its usefulness as a symbol of France's political independence, but could also weaken international support for the French disarmament proposal.    In Bonn, a Government spokesman said today that Germany supported France's initiative. Chancellor Helmut Kohl was personally briefed on it by Mr. Mitterrand last week. A British spokesman also welcomed France's decision.    The signing of the treaty by France will leave China as the only permament member of the Security Council not to have done so. The French disarmament plan was also sent to the Chinese Government over the weekend, but French officials who visited Beijing last month said China had given no indication that it might join the nonproliferation pact.   India, which has exploded a nuclear device, and Pakistan, Israel, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil, countries thought to possess advanced nuclear technology, have also refused to sign. But most countries have accepted it, including nations like Iraq and North Korea that are believed to have ambitions of developing nuclear weapons.    Western diplomats said that while the decision by France to sign the treaty was aimed at bolstering its arms control initiative, they considered it the major feature of the plan. ""It's all part of France's effort to position itself on the world stage after the gulf war,"" a diplomat said.    As with the American plan announced last week by President Bush, Mr. Mitterrand's move has been prompted by the Persian Gulf war and fears of a new postwar arms race, but it also reflects France's embarrassment at having been the principal Western supplier of weapons to Iraq from 1975 to 1990.   While France has called for global controls on weapons production and transfers, however, the American plan focuses only on the Middle East, contemplating a freeze and eventual ban on ballistic missiles, a ban on biological weapons, an end to production of materiel that could be used for nuclear weapons and guidelines on transfers of conventional weapons.   ""Our objectives are clear,"" the French statement said. ""Chemical arms should be eliminated. Bacteriological arms should not be produced. Nuclear arsenals should be brought down to the lowest possible levels compatible with dissuasion. Nonproliferation of nuclear arms remains imperative.""   On conventional weapons, France adopted a British proposal for establishment of a registry of arms sales at the United Nations and it proposed negotiations to achieve ""a balance of forces"" in all regions of the world.   Borrowing from the 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, it suggested that different regions should adopt such confidence-building measures as the exchange of military information and set up agencies to monitor weapons.   French officials emphasized that France was not trying to establish a weapons monopoly for the world's principal military powers because it recognized that many third world nations had legitimate security concerns. ""This is not a Cocom of weapons,"" one French official said, referring to the committee of 17 Western nations that has long controlled the export of sophisticated technology to Soviet-bloc and third world nations.   But the French initiative nonetheless underlined the special responsibility of the permanent members of the Security Council, who account for over 80 percent of all foreign weapons sales. France is believed to be the world's third largest arms exporter after the United States and the Soviet Union.   In its statement today, France also made it clear that it was still not willing to consider dismantling any of its three-pronged nuclear capability: missiles, submarines and aircraft. It said it supported efforts by the Soviet Union and the United States to reduce their nuclear arsenals and would be ready to join nuclear disarmament talks once conditions spelled out by Mr. Mitterrand in 1983 were met.   These include the reduction of Soviet and American nuclear weapons stockpiles to the same levels as those of France. And as one Western diplomat put it, ""That's still a long way from happening."""

It has been going on since well before the United States Sentencing Commission presented its recommendations on penalties for corporate crime to Congress last week, and it may even accelerate while Congress studies the report.   But the recommendations have less bite than they should, mainly because the commission bent to heavy corporate lobbying. They direct judges to impose tougher fines than are now in effect for such Federal crimes as theft, fraud and antitrust violations. The hitch: They allow judges to greatly reduce penalties if companies add internal compliance programs to insure observation of the law."

But for the mediator, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, as well as for the Lisbon Government, the brief ceremony was not only the climax of 12 months of arduous negotiations, but also a turning point in Portugal's troubled relations with its former African colonies.    Many historians have blamed Portugal for the internal warfare that broke out in Angola as soon as Portugal hurriedly granted the territory independence in 1975. But Government officials here believe that Portugal, by playing a central role in the peace process, has now made amends for its past."
