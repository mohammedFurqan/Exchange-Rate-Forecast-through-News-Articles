It was also clear that some leaders have fresh ideas for such challenges as mastering the emerging new media and increasing employment of minorities.   Too bad, then, that turnout was so sparse at the closing general session. Speakers including Gerald M. Levin, the chairman, president and chief executive of Time Warner Inc.; Allen Rosenshine, the chairman and chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, and Roy Bostock, the chairman and chief executive of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and the 1993-94 chairman of the Four A's, as the association is known, all had intriguing things to say.   Attendance at the meeting, which began Wednesday, was already low, at around 400 -- of whom only an estimated 150 were agency executives. But it sagged noticeably on the last day, and Mr. Bostock, the final speaker, addressed perhaps 100 people.   ""After three years of tumult and change, questioning our very value,"" he said, ""I'm happy to say the industry is coming back.""   One indication, he said, is the ""resurgence"" in market share that name-brand products are achieving against cheaper private-label rivals when ""product quality and strong brand advertising are coupled with value pricing"" -- in other words, when marketers, including two of his clients, Procter & Gamble and Burger King, lower prices on brands shoppers prefer.   More ""dramatic evidence"" of improvement, Mr. Bostock said, is that so-called spot television time is sold out from April through June ""for the first time in six or seven years"" in local markets like Atlanta, Washington and Las Vegas, Nev.   Mr. Bostock's optimism manifested itself tangibly after the meeting ended. He spent $1,400 to charter a private airplane at the Greenbrier Valley Airport after mechanical difficulties forced a three-hour delay in the return flight to New York City of a Delta Air Lines jet the Four A's had chartered for those attending.   Mr. Rosenshine, whose agency handles the Delta account, gave no indication he heard the jokes about his client's previous slogan, ""Delta is ready when you are."" In his speech, he compared the new media technologies -- a recurring subject at the meeting -- to ""a party we'd all better start dressing for"" or it ""will go on without us.""   ""The party as we know it is indeed over,"" Mr. Rosenshine said, because ""our clients basically and fundamentally no longer accept on faith the value of conventional advertising placed in conventional media."" Still, he added, ""there are other parties around town we can get in on.""   Mr. Levin said that while ""lots of advertisers share this enthusiasm"" that Time Warner has for parties -- er, new technologies like interactive television -- ""their agencies don't always.""   ""At best, there's often a lack of urgency,"" he added. ""At worst, there's the suspicion this will only take another slice out of an already shrinking advertising pie.""   ""Those of you who jump in sooner will have the chance to participate in the creation of this medium and with the ability to shape and determine its content,"" Mr. Levin said. ""If you stand by and wait, it may be very difficult to play a substantial role.""   Jay Chiat, the chairman and chief executive of Chiat/Day, posed a provocative question about advertising and emerging technologies: ""Will it be allowed?""   Consumers might need to be paid to watch ads, he added, or ""might put up with advertising"" only if it was ""of enough interest.""   ""This is so critical to our collective and individual futures,"" he said at a luncheon on Friday. He proposed that ""each agency select the best and brightest media person"" to work to ""create a kind of knowledge fund"" about new technologies to be shared by all Four A's members.   Mr. Chiat also issued a challenge on another issue: ""the lack of color at this gathering and in the agency industry in general."" He said Chiat/ Day would start a fund by contributing $100,000 over the next four years for programs to encourage members of minorities to enter the industry.   Mr. Chiat recommended that the top 20 agencies make similar donations, raising $2 million; that the next 50 largest each contribute $50,000, for another $2.5 million, and that the remaining Four A's members donate $10,000 each, for another $3 million.   Bruce Lev, a partner and creative services director with Levlane Advertising in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., immediately pledged that he would be ""the first small agency to participate."" Mr. Chiat also received support from O. Burtch Drake, the president and chief executive of the Four A's, who said he would seek to expand participation in the association's minority advertising internship program.   Indeed, there were no black, Hispanic or Asian-American agency executives at the meeting."

Zero-coupon bonds do not pay interest periodically, but instead pay at maturity the principal plus interest compounded at a stated yield.

I.B.M.: Long, Bitter Clash","  In 1953, a young Federal judge named David N. Edelstein had his first brush with I.B.M. and its lawyers in his Manhattan courtroom. A year earlier, the Justice Department had charged the company with antitrust violations. By 1956, after overseeing a series of pretrial motions, Judge Edelstein approved and signed a settlement reached by the Government and the company.    Under the settlement agreement, known as a consent decree, I.B.M. agreed to segregate services operations from hardware and other businesses. By all accounts, the signing was uneventful. But it marked the beginning of what has become one of the most rancorous -- and one of the longest-running -- relationships between a judge and a corporate defendant in the history of Manhattan's Federal court. Personalizing the Issues?    While I.B.M. has accused Judge Edelstein of waging a personal crusade against it, some legal experts say that the company and its lawyers have attacked the judge as way of winning their case."

Survivors of their commando unit gathered today in the little port they liberated on June 6, 1944, to be honored by President Francois Mitterrand for their heroism.   But while there was wreath-laying, distribution of medals and a rendering of the ""Marseillaise"" near the end of a day packed with ceremony, France's commemoration of its own role in D-Day could not help evoking the mixed feelings that the event still stirs among many French."

Hanson, who is stepping down as head of the $80 billion California Public Employees Retirement System, said today that he would become chief executive of a newly formed venture that would seek to invest in single-family housing in California, using money from smaller public pension funds throughout the state.    At a news conference in Sacramento, where he formally announced his resignation as chief executive of Calpers, widely used shorthand for the pension fund, Mr. Hanson said he would join American Partners Capital Group, founded recently by a close friend, Tom C. Stickel of San Diego, a Republican fund-raiser."

But long before Freddie Laker or People Express, Icelandair (then called Icelandic) was breaking all the economic rules of airlines, making money by opening Europe to the backpack set -- among them a graduate student, Bill Clinton, on his way to Oxford.   Now, three decades later, the little airline that could is at it again, repositioning itself as the international carrier whose flights all stop in a country that is hardly anyone's final destination.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, denounced the Clinton Administration today and said its policy toward Haitian refugees was racist and was contributing to a holocaust there.   In an apparent effort to placate Father Aristide, senior Administration officials told him later in the day that the White House planned to step up pressure on the military leaders who ousted him. But the revised policy failed to satisfy six Congressional critics, who were arrested after they staged a sit-in in front of the White House."

It was, as it happens, another case of Wall Street crystal balls showing only what the seers were wishing for. Mr. Nixon, whose funeral is today, wound up being the first President since Herbert Hoover, and only the third President of the 20th century, to have the Dow Jones industrial average decline over his term of office."

My wife and I are both employees of my professional medical corporation. Is it true that we cannot both contribute to the pension and profit-sharing plans provided by the corporation? DR. DAVID E. KNOOP,  Mendham, N.J.  A. Both you and your wife can participate in the corporation's qualified plan. But an Internal Revenue Service rule could limit the amount of your contributions and the corporation's deductions, so that the full benefits would not be available to you both.    When a husband, a wife or both control a company, they are treated as one individual to determine limits under a plan. And the total compensation that may be taken into account by an individual this year in a qualified plan is $150,000.   ""Individuals might try to alleviate the effect of the I.R.S. rule by setting aside company profits for a cash bonus, for an unfunded deferred compensation arrangement or for nondeductible employee contributions to the plan or to an I.R.A.,"" said Howard J. Golden, partner of Kwasha Lipton, an employee benefits firm.   Spouses' I.R.A. Choices  Q. When a beneficiary spouse takes over an I.R.A. where distributions have already begun, must the distribution continue as before or can the spouse commence a new distribution arrangement using the nonspousal joint tables? SOL WIESEL, Delray Beach, Fla.  A. A beneficiary spouse can continue to take distributions at least as rapidly as under the method in effect before the owner's death.   ""Alternatively, the spouse could elect to distribute the entire I.R.A. and roll the proceeds over into his or her own new I.R.A. account,"" said Robert J. Garner of Ernst & Young. ""The spouse, even if over 70 1/2, could then select a new beneficiary. The balance of the rollover I.R.A. could be distributed over the joint-and-survivor life expectancy of the spouse and the nonspousal beneficiary.""   Brokerage Liquidation  Q. My brokerage account, in addition to stock, consists of Treasury notes, Fannie Maes, Freddie Macs and municipal bonds. If my broker should become insolvent, how would it affect my holdings with their maturity dates in the distant future? ANTHONY TARICONE, Brooklyn  A. When a brokerage firm is placed in liquidation, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation tries to replace the securities in the account. It will first try to reconstitute your portfolio as of the date the firm failed, including those holdings with maturities in the distant future.   ""If the defunct brokerage does not have the securities for delivery to the customer, SIPC. will advance funds to the trustee to purchase the missing securities on the open market,"" said Stephen P. Harbeck, senior associate general counsel of the corporation. ""The maximum SIPC may advance to satisfy a customer claim of cash and securities is $500,000,"" including $100,000 in cash."

And at the same time they are forcing suppliers to pick up more of the work and expense of designing and engineering components."

But shortly after the Secretary spoke currency traders appeared to test that resolve as they pushed the dollar down sharply against the yen and the German mark.   Traders said that the fall in the dollar, which has been eroding slightly over the last week, was not set off by Mr. Bentsen's remarks; they should have strengthened the American currency, if anything. Rather, Mr. Bentsen's remarks seemed to have been overshadowed by changing perceptions among some investors about the relative strengths of the American, Japanese and Germany economies. Changes in Economies    The mood that is taking hold, some traders said, is that the American economy is slowing down, and therefore no more interest rate increases are likely now by the Federal Reserve, while both the German and Japanese economies are clearly picking up, meaning no more interest rate declines in those countries are likely for now. Since, among other things, currency traders chase the best interest rates and the growing economy, some have clearly concluded that the best opportunities will be in Japan and Europe."

And central banks, it seems, can do little. By Friday, the White House decided to intervene and got 16 central banks to join it in a $5-billion shopping trip for dollars, but traders didn't even blink, as the dollar hit a '94 low of 1.58 marks. The next step, of course, could well be for the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws again in early July, and this prospect didn't make the stock market happy at all, as the Dow industrials plunged 62 points on Friday, ending a dismal week in which it lost 140 points, or close to 4 percent. President Clinton couldn't figure out why all this was happening, saying the dollar's fall was ""puzzling a lot of economists."" He insisted, probably correctly, that the American economy ""is performing so well."" But for today's hair-trigger markets, nothing is ever remotely that simple."

In fact, the opposite happened. After two days of steep plunges, the market began bouncing back once Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez made clear that he had no intention of resigning. Although analysts do not rule out further volatility, most feel that Madrid's Bolsa index will continue to rise as the economy improves. For all the ups and downs, there are still good buys for those in for the long run.   The market in Madrid, which enjoyed gains of over 50 percent in 1993 and a big surge this January, has behaved much like other European markets of late. It plunged over concern about rising interest rates in the United States, and recovered with cuts in Spain's own domestic rates."

I want to sell some of the stock I bought through dividend reinvestment plans, but the paperwork has been destroyed. How can I find out how much these stocks have cost me? MITCHELL ROTHMAN, Atlantic Beach, L.I.  A. The best source for this information is the transfer agent that handles each company's dividend reinvestment plan. You can usually obtain the name of the transfer agent from the corporation's investor relations office.   ""The agent normally keeps dividend reinvestment transactions from day one,"" said Joseph Tigue, editor of Standard & Poor's annual Directory of Dividend Reinvestment Plans. ""There is no charge for the information."" With duplicate statements from the transfer agent, you can determine how much you have paid for your stock.   The Standard & Poor's Corporation also has a section that provides historical dividend data. The first dividend statistic is free, but additional ones cost $5 each, with a minimum charge of $35. The charges are billed to a major credit card. Inquiries should be directed to (212) 208-1199. Complaints About Advisers  Q. Where does a client with a problem with an investment adviser go for redress? RUTH A. UNTERBERG, New York  A. Anyone who charges to provide advice on the purchase or sale of securities must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser. If you have a complaint about an adviser, call the agency's consumer affairs section at (202) 942-7040.   Some states require investment advisers to be licensed as well. To find the appropriate agency in your state, call the North American Securities Administrators Association at (202) 737-0900.   ""The Better Business Bureau also will mediate your dispute with an investment adviser,"" said Barbara Berger Opotowsky, president of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York.  Section 457 Plans  Q. What are the benefits and drawbacks of a Section 457 plan? SYLVIA ANTONIER SCHER, Great Neck, L.I.  A. A Section 457 plan is offered by state and local governments as a way for employees to save pretax dollars for retirement. Workers can defer as much as $7,500 or 331/3 percent of their taxable income, whichever is lower. Tax is due, however, when the funds are withdrawn.    ""Unless there are unforeseen emergencies, these dollars cannot be withdrawn from the plan until retirement,"" said William Dannecker, president of Retirement System Group Inc. ""In addition, the employee may have no say in how the funds are invested, because investment options are determined by the plan sponsor.""   As a participant, you cannot roll over your money into a more common 401(k) plan, which is used by private companies, or an individual retirement account. If you change jobs, rollovers are permitted only to other 457 plans."

In the real world that Ms. Kilbourne would like to see reflected, sex is practiced by the very young and the very old, by the fat and the handicapped as well as by gays, lesbians and interracial couples.

Not Necessarily,"  Inflation fears fanned by the dollar's fall this week are overblown, many economists say. Despite all the talk about the global economy, they say, the United States is more insulated than most countries against such shocks.   A popular rule of thumb among specialists is that a 10 percent drop in the dollar against the rest of the world's currencies would add no more than one percentage point to the inflation rate over the next year or two. The rule is based partly on the fact that imports account for only a tenth of all goods and services sold in the United States, so changes in their prices are heavily diluted."

But its orderly plan to contain inflation might be disrupted by turbulence in the bond and currency markets, which is putting great pressure on the central bank to act more quickly and raise rates more sharply this time, economists said this weekend.   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has signaled for a year, in appearances before Congress, an intention to raise interest rates before inflation begins to creep up again. But a spectacular rise in long-term interest rates on Friday and the sagging value of the dollar in international trading have shown a broad lack of confidence by many investors in the Fed's ability to control inflation, economists said."

In an interview on Wednesday, the official, Hans Blix, said that the negotiations that the United States was now attempting to revive ""is the easy part of the inspection problem."" He repeatedly said that his agency, an arm of the United Nations, would only begin to know the true scope of the north's nuclear program after it got access to two suspected nuclear waste dumps that might provide evidence of past nuclear work."

The trend toward rising prices fits neatly into the traditional models of what economists expect at this stage of an economic recovery and, if the past is a guide, the prices consumers pay for many goods and services could rise, too.   What is the main force driving up prices, the fear of shortages or an actual tightening of supplies? And can consumers and manufacturers count on economic models to predict how commodity prices will affect the economy? Such questions, which have no definitive answers, are clinging like the summer humidity to the debate about how strong inflationary pressures are becoming and whether the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates again to prevent the economy from overheating. A Sense of Complacency    Inflation hawks say investors and business executives have been lulled into a sense of complacency recently by the failure of inflation rates to rise along with intermittent run-ups in commodity prices. They say inflation is bound to gather speed because all the broad measures of commodity prices are rising, not just the most volatile ones like the Commodity Research Bureau's 21-commodity index, which is dominated by agricultural products."

Shares of the San Antonio T-shirt and medical-supply company closed at $8, down $5.75. Littlefield, Adams shares had not traded since March 31, when the American Stock Exchange had halted trading in the stock so the company could file its year-end financial statements for 1993. The filing was delayed repeatedly, partly because the exchange asked Littlefield to restate its previous three quarterly statements. The restated financials were released yesterday. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company's accounting practices and several recent acquisitions, Littlefield has said."

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, threatened to block the mission if it included an appeal to Haitians not to flee the country, Administration officials said today.   The transmissions will now be devoted entirely to messages aimed at stirring opposition to the country's military leaders and preparing the way for Father Aristide's return, the officials said. They said the United States now intends to resort to paid radio advertisements to send its parallel message that Haitians should not join in an exodus by boat."

Backs Troops for Rwanda But Terms Bar Any Action Soon,"  The United States forced the United Nations Monday to scale down its plans and put off sending 5,500 African troops to Rwanda in an effort to end the violence there.   In a setback for Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, United Nations officials acknowledged that his original rescue plan was overly ambitious. The Security Council agreed instead to a two-phased plan that sharply reduces the immediate troop request, an action that was greeted with anger and frustration by some nations and human rights groups."

Chaos within the country has made the task of counting the dead all but impossible, and as a result news reports, including those in The New York Times, have included death-toll estimates ranging from the tens of thousands to half a million.

The lights were designed last fall by teams of graduate students from Stanford University's schools of business and engineering in an innovative joint project. Afterward the students -- two engineers and two business students on each team -- built them in a machine shop on campus. The main goal of the project: to break down the barriers between engineers and business people, barriers that lead engineers to call their opposites ""bean counters"" and business types to call engineers ""propellerheads."""

Industry leaders had come to Capitol Hill to answer charges of manipulating nicotine levels to fine-tune smokers' addiction. Yes, they said, nicotine levels change, but that's to enhance flavor. Is smoking addictive? A chorus of ""no""s. Does it cause lung cancer? ""It may,"" said James Johnston of R.J. Reynolds. But Andrew Tisch of Lorillard said, ""I do not believe that."" At one point Mr. Johnston lashed out, ""If cigarettes are too dangerous to be sold, then ban them.""

He argued that the option plan and his employment contract stipulated that Paramount had to accelerate those options in the event of his dismissal, any reduction in his duties or any change of control at Paramount.

These sums -- which pay for everything from pollution control equipment to hazardous-waste cleanup -- are so much larger than past outlays that they represent a difference in kind, not just in degree. When such costs were small and scattered, companies appropriately made spending decisions ad hoc, with an eye only toward rule compliance. But now that expenses are continuous and high -- sometimes 10 percent of a company's total costs -- businesses should handle environmental matters the same way they handle other crucial activities: with systematic decision making."

Can I claim a tax loss on bonds called by the issuer? If I make a profit on called bonds, will I be taxed on it? CONSTANTINE MELINTE, Manhattan  A. Many bonds are issued with a call provision that lets an issuer retire all of the debt or a portion of it at a set price before the stated maturity date. The call date usually is 10 years from the date of issue and provides for a premium to be paid. This call provision gives the issuer flexibility and the ability to reduce debt costs.    ""Any premium paid cannot be deducted, nor can it produce a loss, because the Government views any premium paid as an offset to the tax-free interest on the bond,"" said Heather L. Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association. ""However, profit produced on a call will be taxed.""    If you acquire a bond when it is issued at its par value and the bond is called at a premium, you must report this premium as a capital gain. The maximum tax rate on a long-term capital gain, or an investment held more than one year, is 28 percent.    If you acquire the bond when it is issued at a discount to its face value and the bond is later called, any excess over your adjusted basis price will be the capital gain. Trusts for Children  Q. How can I establish a trust for my children by making an initial contribution and subsequent annual contributions? R.M. GIULIANELLI, Maplecrest, N.Y.  A. The most popular -- and least expensive -- way to set aside money for a young child is to open a bank or brokerage account under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act. A possible drawback is that the money in this account must be paid to the minor at the age of 18 or 21, depending on state law.    An alternative is a Section 2403(c) trust, which allows you and your spouse to make contributions of up to $20,000 a year without having to pay a gift tax.    ""The trustee holds the property until the minor reaches 21,"" said Robert W. Benjamin, a partner in the New York law firm of Esanu Katsky Korins & Siger. ""There is then a window of opportunity for the child to withdraw trust assets or the property may remain in trust until a specified later age.""   Inheriting an I.R.A.  Q. What rules govern an individual retirement account that has been inherited by someone other than a spouse? SEYMOUR YUSEM, Manhattan    A. A nonspouse beneficiary is not permitted to treat an inherited I.R.A. as his or her own. This means the beneficiary cannot make additional contributions or roll over the account. Taxes are owed when distributions are made to the beneficiary.    ""If the I.R.A. owner dies before the April 1 following the year he would have reached age 70 1/2, the entire I.R.A. balance would have to be distributed to the beneficiary by the end of the fifth year following the owner's date of death,"" said James DeJesus, a partner in the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm. But if the I.R.A. owner had already begun withdrawals, distributions must continue at least as rapidly as under the previous schedule."

Despite a rebound just before trading closed for the week on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average finished the week 8.6 percent below its all-time high of 3,978.36, which was reached on Jan. 31, after a rise of 68 percent that began in October 1990. The recent decline, which has become more intractable day by day, is seen, at best, as being part of a ""correction"" -- a retreat of roughly 10 to 15 percent from a market high. If this is just a correction, sunny days may not be far away. But some investors are worrying about a full-blown bear market -- a prolonged decline. Excluding the crash of 1929-32, when the market fell 89 percent, the average drop in a bear market has been 36 percent. And that kind of a decline would take us almost back to where the bull market started."

But no one expects a repeat of 1979, when a much broader 10-day teamster strike against 500 companies provided a severe if short-lived economic jolt that forced the Chrysler Corporation, for one, to shut down 9 of its 10 North American auto assembly lines."

But in the intervening four years, children's advocates say, broadcasters have failed to make even a minimal good-faith effort to achieve it."

This fear has made some top officials tolerant of otherwise disliked but secular leaders like President Saddam Hussein of Iraq."

That was clear yesterday, when the dollar slipped, even after the Federal Reserve and 15 other central banks bought billions of dollars on the world's foreign exchange markets to prop up the American currency.   The process of intervention itself is not complex. Unlike interest rates, which are set independently by the Federal Reserve, currency intervention policy is set by the Treasury, in consultation with the Fed. Once the Treasury approves an action, traders at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York call up the major banks that deal in currencies and place orders to buy or sell dollars in return for foreign currencies. Process Akin to Judo    But while the actions are straightforward, the impact is anything but. The process is more akin to judo than boxing, because the central banker uses intervention to divert the force of the market against itself. And if a country is not firm in its footing and confident in its strategy, intervention can well backfire."

That done, it settled for small rises the next two days, before slipping back on Friday to end the week 38 ahead -- all the while, of course, acting as a faithful mirror to interest rates.

What has attracted the American companies is not just the chance to build cable systems, but to offer both television and telephone service over the same fiber optic lines, with the promise of developing additional entertainment and information services."

The stock market had held its breath all week -- up a point, down a point -- waiting for this job signal, but then didn't know what to make of it. At first the Dow fell 16, as the market looked more at the jobless rate (a low rate could signal inflation).

Go Figure.  At last we see what the financial markets wanted! It clearly wasn't the water-drip torture of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates a quarter point at a clip, as it did earlier this year, always hinting of more to come. But last week it moved decisively, not only raising the Federal funds rate by half a point, but also lifting the discount rate the same amount after leaving it unchanged for nearly two years, and banks quickly lifted prime rates, too. The markets loved this decisiveness, with the Dow industrials soaring 95 points in four days and long-bond yields falling. Perverse? Not really. If short-term rates reach a level the markets can live with, the thinking goes, then investors won't worry about long-term inflation. ""We have gotten the dark cloud of uncertainty from over our heads,"" said one economist. (If the winds change, of course, economists will be glad to come up with some seemingly opposite rationale.)"

As Labor Secretary Robert Reich observed at the Detroit jobs conference in March, just a few years ago the conventional wisdom was that Europe and Japan could do no wrong and had nothing to learn from and everything to teach the United States. Now, the United States is doing everything right; Japan, and Europe, everything wrong. Under this theory, the contrast between Europe and the United States is especially vivid: while the former struggles with high unemployment and an expensive system of social insurance, the latter is creating jobs, lowering labor costs and slimming and toning its corporate infrastructure.   The current conventional wisdom came in for criticism last month at the International Seminar on Growth and Employment at Oxford University, a gathering of academics, activists, journalists and directors of progressive think tanks from the United States, Britain, Europe and Australia who came together to mull over politics and the impact of the globalization of markets. The notion that what appears to be working for the United States as it crawls back to economic health -- driving down wages for existing work and creating low-paid jobs -- should be the prescription for Europe does not sit well with progressives. They tend to be less inclined than those who have more faith in the wisdom of the markets to view the economic consequences to individuals of such a course as mere collateral damage."

They want their kids to be in a safe place with a warm, attentive care giver who can communicate with them about their children. And whatever other differences there are among Americans, their hopes for their children converge.

""It cuts across all ethnic and income lines.""   Ms. Galinksy and her colleagues, Carollee Howes, Susan Kontos and Marybeth Shinn, studied in-home child care arrangements in communities in Southern California, Texas and North Carolina.

A mixture of rumor and exit-poll data led investors to conclude -- correctly, it turned out -- that the right-wing coalition led by the businessman Silvio Berlusconi would win a solid victory in the national elections. The market, believing that a clear-cut victory for the right would provide sorely needed political stability and give direction to economic policy, rose sharply.   The Milan market bounced around for the rest of the week as analysts debated whether Mr. Berlusconi would be able to hold together his disparate coalition partners and form a government. The trend, however, was clearly upward. By the end of the week, the Milan BCI index of leading stocks reached 722.99, up 53.26, or nearly 8 percent, since Monday, a performance that had to be considered especially strong in a week in which most other world markets fell precipitously."
