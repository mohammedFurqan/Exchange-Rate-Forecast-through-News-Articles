The action ensured that virtually all of President Bush's tax cuts will be locked in place until after the next presidential election. [Page A1.]    STOCKS FALL -- Stock prices fell sharply as investors worried that rising oil prices would quicken the pace of inflation and force policy makers to raise interest rates further. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.3 percent, to 1,305.92. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 1.2 percent, to 11,500.73, and the Nasdaq fell 2 percent, to 2,272.70.

If the drug is patented, it will become too expensive for patients in developing countries, the groups argue.

Later yesterday, however, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. of Maryland was more optimistic about a possible settlement of the dispute, a spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman, Shareese DeLeaver, said the governor met with the Senate president and the speaker of the House of Delegates and made progress toward a resolution.

Some event gets rained out, one of us has a hard day, or whatever; sometimes, it's nice to just dash over to the video store spontaneously (ours is only five minutes away) to pick up a DVD instead of ordering it via mail.

The gains in pay came as the bank's profit rose 90 percent, to $8.48 billion, largely reflecting its July 2004 acquisition of the Bank One Corporation, which Mr. Dimon ran. Mr. Dimon served last year as chief operating officer, and succeeded Mr. Harrison as chief executive at year-end. Mr. Harrison, 62, and Mr. Dimon, 50, were each given $1 million in salary, an $8.4 million bonus, $12.6 million of restricted stock and other items. J. P.

(BLOOMBERG NEWS)    Citigroup Sued by Market Regulator in Australia  Citigroup is being sued for insider trading in Australia, the first time a company has ever faced such charges in the country. The deputy chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Jeremy Cooper, said in a statement yesterday that Citigroup had used confidential information about the Patrick Corporation, the nation's largest cargo handler, ''against the interest of its client,'' Toll Holdings. Toll, which is based in Melbourne, had made a bid of 4.6 billion Australian dollars ($3.3 billion) for Patrick. Citigroup denied the accusation. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)    Investors Drop Bid for British TV Concern After Rejection  A private equity consortium dropped a bid for ITV, the British TV broadcaster, after the company rejected the consortium's second approach. ITV said it turned down the £5.37 billion ($9.3 billion) bid from the consortium, which consisted of Apax Partners & Company, the Blackstone Group and the Goldman Sachs Group because it carried too much risk. In response, the consortium said it had decided to abandon the approach, but reserved the right to make another offer in the next six months if ITV agreed on terms or if a rival bidder emerged.

''If some words personally injured you, I regret them and I take them back,'' Mr. de Villepin told lawmakers during a question-and-answer session in the Assembly, as François Hollande, the Socialist leader, looked on. Mr. de Villepin added, ''You will understand, Mr. Hollande, that I have not been spared from personal attacks, from calumny and from lies.'' During Tuesday's session, Mr. Hollande accused the government of irresponsibility in its handling of the crisis involving the delay in deliveries of the newest super-jumbo plane by Airbus and possible insider trading by the French co-chief executive officer of its parent company, EADS, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company. The accusation prompted Mr. de Villepin's angry outburst.    ELAINE SCIOLINO (NYT)  "

On Wednesday, Katie Couric announced she was leaving ''Today'' to become the anchor of the ''CBS Evening News.''     NBC's announcement had been expected for more than a week. The timing underscored NBC's intentions: Ms. Vieira's appointment to succeed Ms. Couric is meant to provide ''Today,'' the dominant morning show for the past decade, with the smoothest possible transition from one of the best-known and most experienced program hosts in television to another.

Apparently, hospitals were starting to send their radiology work to India, where doctors who make far less than American radiologists do were reading X-rays, M.R.I.'s and CT scans.      It quickly became a signature example of how globalization was moving up the food chain, threatening not just factory and call center workers but the so-called knowledge workers who were supposed to be immune. If radiologists and their $350,000 average salaries weren't safe from the jobs exodus, who was?  "

Yushchenko. Deputies from the Party of Regions occupied the chamber's rostrum, physically preventing a vote on a new prime minister and parliamentary speaker that has now twice been scheduled and postponed. They vowed to hold out for 30 days, forcing Mr. Yushchenko to call new elections, as required by law if a government cannot be formed. The party, led by Viktor F.
