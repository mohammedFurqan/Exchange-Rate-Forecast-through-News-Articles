In another dismal economic report, the Government said that industrial output fell two-tenths of 1 percent in September.  [ Page 41. ]   President Bush was to unveil a plan to cut car insurance premiums nationwide in a New Jersey campaign speech, his aides said, but he became so rattled by jeering Clinton supporters that he railed against the Democrat, accusing him of evading the draft.

Britain, the host country, lowered interest rates a full percentage point to 8 percent, sending the pound down.

One estimate, from S. G. Warburg, is that the dollar will be at 1.85 marks by the end of 1993, up 19 percent from 1.56 marks today.

The implication is that women's economic progress stalled.   Widely accepted though it may be, that last assumption is mostly wrong. A fresh body of research -- mostly by a new generation of female economists who've mined a mountain of unexplored data -- shows compellingly that women were big economic winners in the 1980's expansion and that their gains are likely to keep coming in the 1990's regardless of who is in the White House."

Not everyone will benefit, though, from the new approach, known as ""seamless travel,"" which melds most of the operations of the foreign and domestic carriers into one. The alliances could also result in a loss of service in some domestic markets as the biggest carriers carve up territories and freeze out competition.

Typifying Western reticence, the United States in October renewed its denial of most-favored-nation trading status to Romania. The refusal is particularly resented by the Government of President Ion Iliescu because ""the clause,"" as it is called here, was granted to the Ceausescu dictatorship and is enjoyed today by most other former Communist countries, as well as China."

Third is the demobilization and merger of the warring factions into a new integrated national army."

On one side are Vice President-elect Al Gore's senior advisers, spiritually committed environmentalists eager to move global warming and rain forest preservation to the top of the national agenda. On the other are economists and their fellow travelers, policy wonks never at a loss for a clever solution. And while there is no inherent conflict, the chemistry between the two groups is wretched. In fact, the infighting could leave President Clinton with a least-common-denominator environmental policy of good intentions and little effective action."

Analysts estimated that the directional drilling systems and services unit at Smith has barely turned a profit this year, as equipment rates plunged by as much as 25 percent in some areas.   But the Smith unit, with annual sales estimated at $160 million, should enable Halliburton to gain ground on two other giants in the oilfield services industry -- Schlumberger Ltd. and Baker Hughes Inc. -- by allowing it to offer a more complete line of drilling services to major oil companies. 'A Pre-emptory Move'    ""This was a pre-emptory move that Halliburton had to make to keep up with the competition,"" said Bill Mankivsky, portfolio manager for a Fidelity mutual fund that invests in oilfield service companies."

So, when nothing is said, investors usually believe nothing has happened.   But what if management decides that when a fundamental piece of the company's investment story changes, it is not important enough to tell investors?"

In the last few weeks the conflict has lured several hundred militants, many of them veterans of the war in Afghanistan, to volunteer for the Bosnian forces. Although the number of volunteers is small, their commitment reflects a much larger public outpouring of support for the Bosnian Muslims that is placing increased pressure on Arab rulers to respond to the crisis."

Mr. Korus largely focused on the negative implications of Dell's currency trading over the last two years, and particularly during the second quarter ended in July.

Now, as campaign oratory shifts to policy-making, many executives of manufacturing companies say they have doubts about how much of the money will actually materialize and how much such a program will increase employment.   The President-elect's plan is straightforward: Stepped-up spending on refurbishing the nation's highways and bridges will swell companies' workloads, quickly creating tens of thousands of jobs and giving a jolt to the economy. But many executives of manufacturing companies -- even those whose core business centers on products essential to any program to rebuild the infrastructure -- say that the money will come slowly, at best, and that the impact on their companies will probably be modest."

The serious security questions raised by doling out the weapons that won the Persian Gulf war to regions of potential conflict barely got a hearing in the Administration's deliberations. The President's decision was based on pure pork-barrel politics.

The fast-growing company's stock, once a source of glee in the town, plummeted on Nov. 25 to a fraction of its former value after its chairman, William J. Hebding, and two other top executives were suspended for falsifying the books.   The news stunned Wall Street, which had been attracted to the little company's robust growth and clean-cut image. But if the people here share Wall Street's pain, they do not share its astonishment. The men who founded and built the company to annual sales of $101 million, and who have now disgraced it, were figures in a society where the distance between the lofty and the humble is often no wider than the local luncheonette counter."

The seized assets would be used to compensate victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and to pay United Nations expenses in Iraq.   The move means that Iraq will now begin using the proceeds of its huge oil reserves, believed to be the second largest in the world, to meet claims against it and to buy more foreign food and medicine for its people instead of relying on aid."

HomeFed, which was the parent company of HomeFed Bank until the bank was seized by Federal regulators in July, said it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code because it was faced with a deadline to answer a petition seeking to put it into bankruptcy. The petition was filed by bondholders that included the Stonehill Investment Corporation and the Leucadia National Corporation. HomeFed said the Chapter 11 filing will give it ""the opportunity to work cooperatively with key constituencies"" to prepare a reorganization plan."

And one reason appears to be that the more popular shows can easily replace any skittish advertiser with another willing to take the risk.   Two recent and prominent examples are cited. NBC's comedy ""Seinfeld"" had 9 of its 10 scheduled advertisers drop out of an episode last month that dealt obliquely with the subject of masturbation. And television's most popular weekly show, ABC's ""Roseanne,"" saw one advertiser withdraw a commercial from an episode in which a regular character announced she was a lesbian."

Yeltsin's Government to hold a secret ballot on one of the most disputed issues before the Russian Congress fueled a scuffle at the podium today, forcing the Speaker to cut short the third day of the session.   The clash disrupted a day that was relatively quiet in the Congress of Peoples' Deputies, at a session only about two-thirds of the legislators attended. Much of the day was spent debating the Government's economic program, and though speeches were often savage in tone, the deputies seemed to be moving toward a resolution that would criticize the economic program without undermining the Cabinet."

The fourth-quarter charge means the auto maker is likely to have a 1992 net loss of between $6 billion and $7 billion, an American corporate record.   Ford's accounting decision was included in a package of bookkeeping adjustments, including the one-time cost of eliminating 10,000 jobs next year from its European operations, which are struggling in the face of a worsening sales slump.  Had Warned of a Loss    In all, the nation's No. 2 auto maker said the special charges would reduce its 1992 income by $7.7 billion, which will be spread over the four quarters of 1992. Ford said results for the first three quarters would be restated to reflect the charges."

Economists saw little heartening news in the figures, saying that the rate of growth in the manufacturing sector was too slight to be considered significant.   The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its index of economic activity rose to 50.6 percent, from 49 percent in September. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the nation's manufacturing economy is expanding while a reading below 50 percent indicates economic contraction."

This is the first significant failure of a life insurance company in more than 16 months, experts say, and comes as the industry has been trying to restore public trust after the failure of several large companies. Realty Investments Blamed    Many life insurance companies still suffer from large and languishing investments in commercial real estate. But few companies, regulators say, have nearly as high exposure to real estate as Fidelity Mutual.   The Pennsylvania Insurance Department took over management of the company late Friday and ordered an indefinite moratorium on policy cancellations and loans to customers after a sudden run on the company's assets, said Ronald Chronister, a Pennsylvania deputy commissioner. The takeover was not well publicized until yesterday.   The company will continue to pay annuities and death benefits. But it is unclear what will happen to customers' savings until the state develops a plan to merge, restructure or liquidate the company. ""We certainly can't guarantee that they will see all of their money again,"" Mr. Chronister said.   The action Friday froze about $30 million that 1,290 policyholders had requested from the company since mid-October, the insurance department said. The company had been receiving requests to withdraw cash totaling about $3 million a week since March, with the run on assets rising to $14.8 million in the last week of October. Public 'Beginning to Forget'    Joseph M. Belth, a professor of insurance at the University of Indiana, said Fidelity Mutual's failure constituted a setback for companies that had been hoping public concerns about their solvency -- and the effect on withdrawals -- had receded.   ""I think this is a big trauma to the industry,"" Mr. Belth said. ""People were beginning to forget.""   Last year, the failures of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company in New Jersey and the Executive Life and First Capital Life insurance companiesin California first raised fears about the industry. Mutual Benefit Life, the largest life insurance company ever to fail, had more than 700,000 customers.   Mr. Belth said that his review of Fidelity Mutual last spring showed that at the end of 1991 nearly 43 percent of the company's portfolio was in mortgages and real estate investments. By the end of 1991, Fidelity Mutual's problem mortgages had risen to $78 million, or 146.5 percent of its surplus capital, he estimated."

Kennedy's tax cut of 1962 was widely celebrated as the dawn of the millennium of can-do economics. But by the early 1980's, the use of fiscal stimulus to revive a flagging economy was seen as an act of hubris, a temptation to the slumbering gods of inflation. And by 1990, the notion of adding to the budget deficit for any reason seemed folly.   Now the pendulum is swinging back. How could anyone believe that policies so long discredited would do more good than harm?"

Brooks Brothers has instead undergone an appropriately subdued metamorphosis, evident in Hermes-esque neckwear, stylishly faded sports shirts and stirrup pants hanging unobtrusively alongside the rep ties, button-downs and kilts that are the chain's signature merchandise."

President-elect Bill Clinton surely understands that in making economic policy he must take the view that women matter. He supports many policies of special importance to women, such as the proposed Family and Medical Leave Act, which will require businesses to provide job security for workers who must leave work temporarily to meet family-care and medical needs. Much more must be done, however, to transform the economy from one that assumes ""women's work"" -- the care of the family and the home -- will somehow get done, to one that makes meeting human needs a central source of strength and growth. Only when that happens will women's -- and men's -- full productive potential be released."

The section reprints Benetton advertisements dating to 1984, including some that generated criticism and publicity in about equal measures. Perhaps the most notorious is a two-page ad from 1989 showing a white infant nursing at a black woman's breast. Though that ad appeared in Europe, it did not run in American publications because of concerns over how it might be interpreted. (Those concerns are still prevalent; the ad will run only in issues of Rolling Stone sent to subscribers, while copies sold on newsstands will carry another ad in its place.)"
