The dispute is over prepaid services that let consumers pay for calls upfront, rather than sign up for a monthly plan, and then use the calling minutes without having to enter a pass code. A Cingular spokesman, Mark Siegel, said the company intended to appeal."

Mr. de Klerk, who won the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela for his role in ending apartheid, said that the name Pretoria had ''a central and honorable place in our history,'' reflecting South Africans' triumph against British colonialism. Pretoria was named for Andries Pretorius, a prominent Afrikaner figure. But he is best known for the 1838 Battle of Blood River, so named because a river ran red with Zulu blood. The city council voted in March to rename the city Tshwane, after a chief who ruled in the area in the 1800's.   Michael Wines (NYT)    "

''The ticket can still be used for a year, it's just that the actual change has to be made within 90 days,'' said Kurt Ebenhoch, a Northwest spokesman. The new policy, which he said was adopted for better inventory control, applies to all tickets issued on or after April 15. Terry Trippler, the chief executive of Farefacts.com, a travel adviser based in Minneapolis, said, ''It's a big change.'' As of yesterday, he said, no other airline had followed Northwest's lead. Typically, major airlines allow passengers who cancel an original flight on a nonrefundable ticket to rebook the ticket anytime within a year for a $100 change fee. Over the last five years, business travelers have been rebelling against high walk-up fares by switching to the nonrefundable tickets favored by tourists. Because business travelers change their plans so often, many corporate travel managers use procedures, like American Express's TicketTrax service, to keep track of unused tickets and flag them for rebooking.    EUROPE'S LURE -- Despite a weak dollar, trans-Atlantic air traffic grew in March for the 21st consecutive month, according to Donald N. Martin & Company, a travel marketing specialist based in New York. For all of 2004, travel to Europe (including the Russian Federation) originating in the United States rose to 12.1 million trips, an increase of 12.4 percent over 2003, the company said, citing data from the United States Commerce Department. In 2005, industry analysts say, the volume of travel by Americans to Europe is expected to match or surpass the record of 12.8 million trips in 2000. Economy-class trans-Atlantic fares are expected to remain at last summer's levels, even though domestic carriers have been adding trans-Atlantic capacity, said Hugo Burge, the president of Cheapflights.com, an online fare broker. Premium cabin seats, however, are being discounted, Mr. Burge said. Airlines are sharply cutting fares in business class on trans-Atlantic routes, too, he said.    HANGING UP -- The revenue that hotels derive from guest room telephones fell last year to an average of $2 a day per occupied room, compared with $4.10 in 2000, according to the Hospitality Research Group of PKF Consulting, which is based in San Francisco. The reasons are fairly obvious, said Robert Mandelbaum, the director of research information services: increased use of cellphones and calling cards as well as a reaction against surcharges on telephone calls. While hotel managers struggle to adapt to and even profit from new portable communications technologies, room phones and fax machines could go the way of the in-room fly swatter, Mr. Mandelbaum said.    CHEAPER BY THE MILE -- As competition over fares remained fierce, the revenue airlines squeezed out of travelers for each mile flown fell 6.7 percent on domestic routes in the first quarter for eight major airlines, the Air Transport Association said. Most international routes fared better. Yields rose 2.7 percent on Atlantic routes and 3.7 percent on Pacific routes, while falling 4.4 percent on Latin American routes for the eight airlines surveyed: Alaska; American, America West, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United and US Airways.

But she denied trying to influence the vote count and insisted she would not resign, as some of her opponents have been demanding in a three-week-long political crisis over a secretly recorded telephone conversation between a woman who sounds like Mrs. Arroyo and a man said to be an election commissioner. In the recording, the woman asks if her lead could fall below a million votes and expresses concern about areas in the south. The man tells her, ''We will do our best.'' The final tally gave her more than a million votes over her chief rival. In her address, Mrs. Arroyo said she had spoken to the election commissioner not because she wanted to influence the outcome of the election but because she was anxious to protect her votes. Members of her government said they hoped the apology would put the issue behind her.   Carlos H. Conde (NYT)  "

After more than a month of silence, a dissident group of retired Morgan Stanley executives described in greater detail their proposal to split the firm in two, in a further assault on the leadership of Philip J.

Purcell, a Wall Street outsider whose leadership of Morgan Stanley has been marked by a series of legal clashes and bitter internal dissent, said that he would retire as soon as his successor was named. The announcement yesterday ended a public power struggle between Mr. Purcell and dissident former executives.

The closely held Freedom Wireless sued Boston Communications and cellular carriers in 2000, claiming Boston Communications' prepaid wireless services infringed two patents.

[Page A1.]    Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a congressional panel that the economy is on a ''reasonably firm footing'' but expressed concern about the ''negligible'' rate of personal savings, the huge trade deficit and growing evidence of risky speculation in the housing market. [C1.]    A Medicine's Withdrawal Shows Drug Agency's Problems  The saga of Propulsid, a heartburn medicine pulled from the market in 2000, illustrates the difficulty that the Food and Drug Administration has in regulating drugs after they have been approved. [A1.]    Three senators plan to block a vote on the nomination of a candidate to head the Food and Drug Administration because of issues related to the morning-after birth control pill and condoms. [A13.]    Eli Lilly agreed to pay $690 million to settle 8,000 lawsuits filed by people who claimed they developed diabetes and other diseases after taking Zyprexa, a medication for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. [C1.]    Shares in Biogen surged after reports emerged that its Tysabri drug for multiple sclerosis might be brought back to the market. [C3.]    Two senators sent letters to 18 major drug makers asking for information about grants they have given in recent years to state officials and other organizations that may have influenced drug purchases by federal Medicaid and Medicare programs. [C6.]    Boston Scientific said a Dutch court ruled in a patent suit that a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary can be forced to end production of its Cypher stents in the Netherlands and to halt sales of the drug-coated devices there. [C4.]    China Considers a New Standard for Its Currency  China's political leadership is considering breaking the 11-year link between the dollar and China's currency, the yuan, and tying its value instead to a group of currencies. [C4.]    Banker Acquitted in Mutual Funds Trading Case  A former broker with Bank of America, Theodore C. Sihpol III, was acquitted of most of the charges of improper trading in mutual funds in the first major legal defeat for Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. [C1.]    An executive of the General Re Corporation plans to plead guilty today to criminal fraud charges, according to a court document and individuals briefed on an inquiry into insurance abuses. [C1.]    Morgan Stanley has agreed to pay $2.7 million for violating rules in connection with initial public offerings. [C14.]    A former chief executive of AremisSoft Corporation, a defunct software company, has agreed to settle fraud charges for $200 million. [C3]    Corporate Troubles in China Parallel Those in the U.S.  Big corporations are having trouble making money, they have big debts, and they have obligations to provide pensions, adding up to trouble for corporate America and, in a remarkable parallel, corporate China. [C1.]    Union Would Accept Only Minor Benefit Cuts at G.M.  A United Auto Workers leader said the union would accept only modest cuts in health benefits in response to General Motors' plea for bigger cuts. [C3.]    Investor Wins Board Seat at French Ad Concern  The investor Vincent Bolloré, left, won a showdown with the management of Havas, the French advertising company. Mr. Bolloré, who owns 20.7 percent of Havas, was elected to the board, along with three other executives representing his investment firm. The Havas board, led by chief executive Alain de Pouzilhac, had urged shareholders to reject Mr. Bolloré's bid for the board. Advertising. [C8.]    Australian Phone Company Hires a Chief Executive  Telstra, the dominant telecommunications provider in Australia, hired Solomon D.

[C4.]    AOL Plans Ad Campaign With Its Competitors  In its attempt to attract users to its free Web sites, AOL will spend millions of dollars to advertise on popular search engines like Google and Yahoo, the very competitors it is trying to lure users away from. [C3.]    Intel Raises Revenue Forecast as Chip Sales Surge  The Intel Corporation raised its second quarter revenue forecast because of strong sales of notebook computers that use its Centrino chip. [C3.]    Pathmark Shareholders Accept a Takeover Bid  Shareholders of Pathmark Stores approved a $150 million offer from the Yucaipa Companies, a private equity firm, to buy a 40 percent stake and warrants to purchase more shares. [C2.]    Stocks Rise After Remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman  Stocks gained in response to a bullish statement on the economy by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.16, to 10,503.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 6.26, at 1,200.93. The Nasdaq composite index added 16.73, to 2,076.91. [C8.]  "

The Andersen indictment effectively put the firm out of business (even though the Supreme Court later overturned its conviction), costing thousands of jobs and shrinking the number of major accounting firms to four from five. Without question, the same fate would await KPMG were it to be prosecuted; accounting firms simply cannot withstand an indictment. Can anyone say ''The Big Three?''     If you've been following the KPMG story, you know two things. First, its actions were truly reprehensible. A 2003 investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations leaves no ambiguity: the firm absolutely knew the shelters it was devising would probably not pass muster with the Internal Revenue Service, but sold them anyway. Everything about these products and the way they were marketed was sleazy. The smallest of the Big Four, KPMG used them to bolster revenue -- they are said to have generated $124 million in fees for the firm -- and the executives involved were rising stars. In the Enron debacle, Andersen's fundamental sin was spinelessness; its auditors weren't willing to stand up to a high-paying client determined to bend (and break) accounting rules to post fictitious profits. Though it affected fewer people, KPMG's behavior was more mendacious.  "

I've been hearing a lot about video-on-demand technology with cable television but I'm clueless as to how it actually works. Is this the same thing as the old pay-per-view, except with a different name?    A. Both video-on-demand and pay-per-view are services for delivering specialized or premium content like commercial-free movies, and many cable television companies offer them. But the two services use different technology to bring movies to the small screen.    Movies featured on pay-per-view cable channels typically start at preordained times as scheduled by your cable television provider. When you order and pay for a film showing on a pay-per-view channel through your provider, the cable company unscrambles the channel at the time your selected movie is playing so you can watch it.

In an interview before his flight, Mr. Jackson said that President Fox's statements had ''touched a raw nerve'' because of the animosity -- and even violent clashes -- between blacks and Hispanics, who often compete for America's lowest-paying jobs and limited educational opportunities.

The company said it was no longer certain enough of its outlook to provide earnings guidance for the year, backing away even from the bleak revisions it made last month. [C8.]    In Asia, General Motors' profits plummeted in the first quarter, but the first hints of a rebound are starting to become visible in China, its most important Asian market. [C8.]    Court Limits Basis for Stock Suits  The Supreme Court ruled in a closely watched fraud case that an accusation that a company's misrepresentations caused an inflated share price was insufficient as a basis for a lawsuit. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, left, writing for the court, said that the purpose of permitting private suits for securities fraud was ''not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause.'' [C3.]    New Food Pyramid Has 12 Forms  The Agriculture Department introduced a food pyramid that comes in 12 versions, depending on activity level and caloric need. [A23.]    Stocks Gain on Earnings News  Stocks rose as companies' earnings beat analysts' estimates. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 56.16 points, to 10,127.41. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 6.80 points, to 1,152.78. The Nasdaq composite index rose 19.44 points, or 1 percent, to 1,932.36. [C9.]    Core Inflation Rate Is Modest  The government reported a smaller-than-expected increase in prices excluding energy and food. Another report that said that home construction plunged last month. [C20.]    Longtime Producer to Join Disney  Scott Rudin, a longtime producer whose films last year included ''The Stepford Wives'' and ''Closer,'' said he would end his long-standing deal with Paramount Pictures and begin making movies for Walt Disney Studios when his contract expires in 2006. [C4.]    Time Out New York Editor to Leave  Cyndi Stivers, the founding editor in chief of Time Out New York, said that she was stepping down as president and editorial director to join Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia as an executive vice president. [C4.]    Coca-Cola Earnings Fall 6 Percent  In its first-quarter earnings announcement, Coke reported sales growth in Asia, Africa and Latin America that far outweighed growth in the United States and Europe. These positive results allowed Coke's chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, to project a note of optimism amid otherwise lackluster results. Coke's overall earnings fell 6 percent, to $1.5 billion, slightly exceeding forecasts. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $5.3 billion. [C20.]    Pfizer reported sharply lower first-quarter earnings, while Johnson & Johnson, reported a doubt-digit earnings increase. [C2.]    Merrill Lynch said that its first-quarter earnings fell 3 percent from a year earlier, exceeding analysts' estimates. It also announced a $4 billion stock buyback program. [C20.]  "

The ambassador was summoned to the Finnish Foreign Ministry after Mr. Berlusconi revealed his techniques for persuading the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, to give up her country's bid, in favor of Italy, as home of the European Union's food safety office. ''I had to use all my playboy tactics, even if they have not been used for some time,'' Mr. Berlusconi said at the opening of the new office in Parma on Tuesday. In 2001, in the midst of the duel over which country would be assigned the office, Mr. Berlusconi staked a claim to Italian culinary supremacy, saying, ''Finns don't even know what prosciutto is.'' On Tuesday, he disparaged Finnish food again. ''I've been to Finland and I had to endure the Finnish diet, so I am in a position to make a comparison,'' he said. News accounts differed on whether he was most offended by smoked reindeer or smoked herring.   Ian Fisher (NYT)"

Showa Day, as it will be called, will be held on Hirohito's birthday, April 29, which is now a holiday called Green Day. Hirohito, whose rule lasted from 1926 until his death in 1989, is regarded by most Asians and some Japanese as a symbol of Japanese militarism and aggression in Asia, and he is still a revered figure for Japanese nationalists. But most Japanese now associate him with the postwar years of the Showa era, during which Japan rebuilt itself and became the world's No.2 economy. Two previous attempts to rename the holiday, in 2000 and 2002, were shelved in consideration of Asian sensitivities, but growing nationalism allowed the law's enactment this time. The holiday had been known as Emperor's Day before Hirohito's death, but was changed to Green Day to avoid an Asian reaction and to honor the emperor's interest in nature.

In other cases, A.I.G. units booked premiums from policies that were never sold, the executives said.     The practice does not appear to have artificially inflated A.I.G.'s profit and loss statements, in which earned premium, not written premium, is a major component, according to a fourth former executive.

One of six attendees at a meeting last week was executive at Paramount Television and King World Productions who developed the ''Dr. Phil'' talk show and ''The Insider,'' a celebrity news program. [C10.]    Newsweek Puts Restrictions on Unnamed Sources  Newsweek said that it would tightly limit the use of unnamed sources in the wake of a retracted report about a Koran being flushed down a toilet at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Newsweek's two top editors, or other senior editors they designate, must approve stories with unidentified sources.

Finkelstein of DePaul University has prompted a change in the publisher of Mr. Finkelstein's book. At issue is Mr. Finkelstein's book, ''Beyond Chutzpah,'' which charges Mr. Dershowitz with distorting facts in his 2003 book ''The Case for Israel.'' Mr. Dershowitz, left, objected in letters to the publisher, charging Mr. Finkelstein, right, with making up facts and prompting the publisher to delay publication. Mr. Finkelstein went to a different publisher to avoid the delay.

But with some rates already rising, economists worry that the bet could turn bad. [Page C1.]    Union Leader Says He Opposes G.M. Plan on Cuts  Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers, said he would not agree to reopen negotiations on General Motors' labor contract before it expires in 2007 or to roll back health benefits for G.M.'s hourly workers to match the lesser benefits of the company's salaried workers. [C1.]    The likelihood of a schism in organized labor increased when five major unions formed a growth-oriented coalition and the presidents of four of the unions hinted strongly that they might quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O. [A23.]    Report Shows Consumer Prices Declined in May  Consumer prices edged down in May for the first time in nearly a year, pushed by lower energy prices. [C1.]    Former Bristol-Myers Executives Are Indicted  Two former executives of Bristol-Myers Squibb were indicted on conspiracy and securities fraud charges related to a wholesale inventory manipulation that artificially inflated company revenues. [C1.]    Officials Overrode Objections on Tobacco Penalties  Justice Department officials overrode the objections of lawyers running the government's tobacco racketeering trial and ordered them to reduce the penalties by $120 million, despite concerns that the move would be seen as politically motivated, internal documents and interviews show. [A1.]    OPEC Raises Its Quotas on Oil Production  OPEC said that it had agreed to lift its oil production quotas by 500,000 barrels a day, a sign of its unease with soaring worldwide energy demand. The decision, which was largely expected, failed to prevent another increase in oil prices. Crude oil futures for July delivery rose 57 cents yesterday, to $55.57 a barrel, in New York. The price reached a record last April, exceeding $58. [C3.]    Senate Democrats agreed with Republicans on the need to reduce the nation's dependence on imported oil. But they differed on how to do it. [A24.]    Payments by Public Broadcasting Are Examined  Investigators at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are examining $15,000 in payments to two Republican lobbyists last year that were not disclosed to the corporation's board, people involved in the inquiry said. [A1.]    S.E.C. Recommends Accounting Changes  In an effort to make it easier to determine the accurate state of companies' balance sheets, the Securities and Exchange Commission recommended steps to change accounting for leases, pensions and derivatives. [C4.]    The Securities and Exchange Commission is assembling an advisory committee for small public committees with the aim of lightening their regulatory load because of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Small Business. [C6.]    Senate Panel Approves Crawford for F.D.A.  A Senate panel cleared Dr. Lester Crawford to head the Food and Drug Administration, but his nomination still faces uncertainty. [A20.]    Chiron to Offer Fewer Doses of Flu Vaccine  The Chiron Corporation said it would provide fewer doses of its flu vaccine this year than it had anticipated, tightening the supply somewhat. [A22.]    Stock Indicators Post Modest Gains  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.80 points, to 10,566.37. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 2.67 points, to 1,206.58. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 5.88 points, to 2,074.92. [C7.]    Boeing and a Rival Vie for Air Force Tanker Contract  As the Air Force studies how to replace its aging fleet of 540 fleet aerial tankers, Boeing has been proclaiming the wonders of its new tanker plane. EADS North America, the American military subsidiary of the parent company to Airbus, meanwhile, has been conducting a highly publicized campaign to line up American political support for its offering. [C3.]    France and Japan are hoping to develop a commercial jet that could cut the flight time between Tokyo and New York by more than half. [C4.]    Group Plans Internet Service for Villages in India  An international consortium is planning to establish thousands of rural Internet centers in India to bring services to isolated villages.
