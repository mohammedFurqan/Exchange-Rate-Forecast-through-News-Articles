The Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence rose to 138.3 in February, from a revised 128.3 in January. The February figure was the highest since October 1968, when it reached 142.3. Consumer sentiment is viewed as important because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity. In testimony before Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan said, ''Events in the months ahead are not likely to unfold smoothly.'' On Friday, the Commerce Department gave Mr. Greenspan a bit of support, reporting that the American economy ended 1997 by growing at a 3.9 percent annual rate, a downward revision from January's 4.3 percent estimate."

Thanks for the integral part you played in our success. For 38 years you were always there to guide us. Without you, who knows where we would have been. Gould Investors LP    MENDELSON-Herbert L. On March 23, 1998 of streptococcus A infection. Treasured husband of Joan, cherished father of Susan and Barry Stein, Billy and Carole and Clifford and Tammy, proud grandfather of Benjamin and Noa, Sophie and Michael and Amanda and Annie, devoted son of Ralph (and Edna), adored brother of Myra Waldman and brother-inlaw of Arthur and Susan Resnick, caring uncle of Steven and Bobby (and Amy) Scher and Ben Resnick, and beloved cousin of Marilyn Marber. Herb was a senior partner of Herrick, Feinstein LLP where he practiced law for fortythree years. Herb assisted many organizations with his time, abilities and resources. He served as a member of the board of directors of ALYN Hospital for Handicapped Children in Israel, as Chairman of the Greater New York Campaign Cabinet of UJA/Federation, as Chairman of the North Shore Long Island UJA/Federation Campaign Cabinet, and as Head of the UJA Long Island Country Club Mission Program. Herb was also a board member of The Daniel Heumann Fund for Spinal Cord Research, was Chairman of the Glen Oaks Country Club Charity Committee and a board member of the Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity. At Syracuse University, Herb was selected as the MVP of its lacrosse team and as All American goalie in soccer. The funeral service will be on Wednesday, March 25, 1998, 10:00 AM at Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Contributions in Herb's memory may be made to ALYN Hospital for Handicapped Children in Israel, 19 West 44th Street, New York, NY 10036.    MENDELSON-Herbert L. The Herrick, Feinstein Family is suffering and grieving deeply over the most untimely loss of our ''golden boy,'' our ''go to guy,'' our senior partner. Herb's boyish good looks and athletic prowess, his brilliant and incisive intellect, his lifelong practice of menschlichkeit and devotion to charitable activities on behalf of so many worthy causes will be sorely missed by us, his law firm, by each of the members of the ''one for all, all for one'' Mendelson/Scher Family of which he was the kindly patriarch and by the hundreds of people who consider Herb and his love partner for life, darling Joan, as good friends. Herb taught others about living by the golden rule, about ethics and honesty, about the importance of family and friendship and other values all good people cherish, not by talking, but by his actions and the manner in which he conducted his personal and professional affairs day in and day out. The minions of lawyers and clients he worked with over the last 43 years, not only those in our law firm but also the men and women who sat on the other side of the table, could see in Herb a lawyer who immediately could digest and understand the highly complex issues and quickly devise creative and practical solutions. Herb's talents were prodigious-a resourceful and fertile brain, deep expertise in his specialty, a masterful negotiator, scrupulously honest and fair, all blended in with such a winning personality. After graduating as an All American goalie on the Syracuse University soccer team, Herb became an editor of the Syracuse Law Review.

At the auto show last week, Volkswagen rolled out its new Beetle, which returns to the Lilliputian end of the United States market after a 21-year absence, while just a few booths away Ford unveiled its Brobdingnagian new F-250, a pickup whose hood ornament is further off the ground than Dr. Ruth Westheimer's chin. Car makers and critics braced for a struggle over the Yahooish way light trucks have of mangling most any car they hit broadside; manufacturers are quietly pushing to have new side-impact standards set no higher than in Europe, where, unlike here, big light trucks are scarce. But the news on the environmental front might please the Houyhnhnms, Swift's race of selfless, sagacious horses: the Big Three and several Japanese companies are talking seriously about making new high-technology, high-mileage cars in the next few model years, and Ford says it will voluntarily upgrade its light trucks to meet the much tougher emissions standards imposed on cars.    PRICES  Won't Be Undersold  Wholesale prices fell two-tenths of a percent in December and 1.2 percent for all of 1997, the Labor Department announced, and the ''core'' rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy numbers, fell for the first time in memory last year. Analysts are calling the inflation outlook the best in a generation, with even the labor markets -- tight, by historical standards -- on good behavior. Among economists, fretting about inflation is beginning to give way to fretting about possible deflation and the economic harm that would come.    JOBS  Won't Be Idle  The latest evidence from the astrophysics lab says the universe will keep expanding forever, a characteristic that the American economy and labor force seem to share these days. An unexpectedly plentiful 370,000 new jobs were created in December, but unemployment actually ticked up slightly because an even greater number of new workers entered the labor force, the Labor Department reported. A record 64.1 percent of American adults are now in the labor force, but it wasn't a salary bidding war that drew them in: Real hourly wages rose just 0.1 percent last month.    BUDGETS  You Mean There's Extra?  President Clinton said he planned to submit a balanced budget to Congress for fiscal 1999, three years ahead of schedule, and predicted a comparatively trivial Federal deficit of about $22 billion for 1998. Wall Street yawned, having long since predicted that the strong economy would erase the deficit, but political leaders dived gleefully into an unaccustomed task: arguing over what to do with spare money. The President is expected to discuss new initiatives on child care and the environment in his State of the Union message later in the month; House Speaker Newt Gingrich is talking about tax cuts. Consumers are way ahead of Washington this time: They unexpectedly reversed a three-year borrowing binge in November, reducing their total indebtedness by $4.2 billion, according to Treasury Department figures released last week.    ASIAN TURMOIL, PART I  Rescues Needing Rescues  It turns out not to be quite as simple as tossing out a multibillion-dollar life preserver and hauling in the rope. Financial rescue plans sponsored by the International Monetary Fund for several Asian countries showed signs of unraveling last week, largely because of the reluctance of the recipients to swim along quietly in the specified direction. Indonesia announced a new budget that blithely ignored the I.M.F.'s fiscal advice, and when the rescuers' displeasure became known, the country's currency and its stock market sank like stones. Dire rumors, panic buying and fears of political instability swept the country. And in Thailand, which was the first Asian domino to fall, I.M.F.-required austerity measures are already pinching too hard for the Prime Minister, who asked for an easing of the terms.    ASIAN TURMOIL, PART II  Devil in the Details  Compared with Southeast Asia, South Korea seems calm. Its streets are quiet, and the stock market has stanched its bleeding. But the particulars of the debt restructuring the country badly needs are proving thorny. After a week of squabbling, creditor banks were near agreement on a plan to give the country a breather of 30 to 90 days on loan payments. Still to be sorted out is what happens next: who will buy a proposed bond issue and what kinds of government guarantees they will get.    COMPUTERS  New Year, New Prospects  January is the time of year Steven Jobs likes to spring surprises: He introduced the Macintosh computer with a stunning ''1984''-themed commercial that ran just once, during that year's Super Bowl; since then new products from Apple Computer have often been announced at the January MacWorld trade show. Mr. Jobs's show stopper this year was his announcement that Apple had managed a small profit in the first quarter of its 1998 fiscal year. The crisis is far from over for the company Mr. Jobs founded -- and is now trying to turn around after a three-year slide in other hands -- but Wall Street was delighted by the progress so far, pushing Apple's stock up 20 percent.    TELECOMMUNICATIONS  Buying Local  Why invent what you can buy instead? SBC Communications, which bought Pacific Telesis in 1996 in the first merger among the Baby Bells, has announced a deal to acquire Connecticut's phone company, Southern New England Telephone, one of the few remaining sizable independents, for $4.4 billion. One lure: S.N.E.T. has regulatory permission to sell long-distance service to its local customers, a privilege so far denied to SBC and its former Bell siblings.

Claim anything to which you are entitled on your return, tax professionals say, but if your action raises an audit flag, be sure you have the records to defend it. Ten such flags are:      * Discrepancies in the income you report and what payers have reported to the I.R.S. on forms W-2 and 1099. If the issuers have made a mistake, taxpayers should ask them to issue corrected forms.    * Married taxpayers filing separately. The I.R.S. has found that many such people do not report items consistently between the two returns.    * Regular returns with sizable items that often make taxpayers liable for the alternative minimum tax. Among them: deductions for state and local property and income taxes, the exercise of incentive stock options and big capital gains.    * Working in a business in which substantial cash payments are often made. The I.R.S. tends to look at doctors, lawyers, store owners and waiters in this regard, and it is particularly interested in self-employed taxpayers who report gross receipts of $100,000 or more on Schedule C.    * Being in a business that the I.R.S. sees as needing special attention. Among roughly 100 businesses that the I.R.S. is examining more closely are air charters, art dealers, bed and breakfasts, entertainment concerns, gas stations, liquor stores, mortuaries, pawn shops, restaurants and bars, taxi services and used-car dealers.    * Deductions or business expenses that seem large in proportion to reported income. The I.R.S. does not disclose its exact criteria.    * A return signed by an accountant or tax preparer who is on an I.R.S. list of ''problem preparers'' who have repeatedly violated the law.    * Complex business or investment transactions without clear explanations. Attach a separate statement if needed to explain an item on the return.    * Schedule F (farm) losses, particularly when the taxpayer has sizable salary income.    * Claiming the earned-income credit. The I.R.S. has found abuse in this area and tends to scrutinize claims.  "
