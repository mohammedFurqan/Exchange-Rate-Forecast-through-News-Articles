But with Serbia's political opposition in disarray, the army appears to have become the single strongest source of dissent to President Milosevic's policies."

He revealed that the Government may privatize such state-owned companies as Eskom, which generates half the electricity produced in sub-Saharan Africa, Transnet, a transportation conglomerate that owns South African Airways, and Telkom, the telecommunications company."

And the bad feelings persist nearly two months later.   MCA's 81-year-old chairman and chief executive, Lew R. Wasserman, and 59-year-old president and chief operating officer, Sidney J. Sheinberg, had made the 14-hour flight to Osaka on Sept. 17 for the meeting. They were appalled by the welcome they received the next morning. Matsushita's president, Yoichi Morishita, appeared two hours late -- and only after lower-level Matsushita executives had made clear that they would not consider the proposal."

Mr. Spring had attacked Mr. Reynolds over his handling of a much-publicized case involving extradition of a Roman Catholic priest accused, and later convicted in Northern Ireland, of child molesting. Together, the two parties, with 99 seats, had controlled the 166-member Parliament with the largest majority, 37 votes, in the 74-year history of the state."

In its fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, Sara Lee took a restructuring charge of $495 million, or $1.03 a share. Sara Lee's stock gained 12.5 cents, to $22.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. Sara Lee is reducing capacity in its United States hosiery operations  and European personal products unit.   "

D. Spangler Jr., offered yesterday to buy the company for $940 million, or $43.50 a share. But analysts ridiculed the price as far too low, and investors bid up the shares $12.0625, to $44.8125, in Nasdaq trading.   That price, however, represented a sharp increase from the $12.50 a share at which National Gypsum was valued 16 months ago, when the company emerged from bankruptcy protection. At that time, the senior creditors and the company's management, since replaced, told other creditors, including asbestos claimants, that the company was not worth a penny more."

That's where productivity is supposed to be rising and costs falling. On the news, the stock plunged $3.75, and $1.875 more on Friday, to a yearly low of $41.25. Both days, volume was huge, making G.M. far and away the Big Board's most active stock. Don't look now, but shares in G.M. -- the giant of an again-mighty industry -- have been falling steadily all year. What's the problem? It isn't market share -- it inched up to 31.5 percent. The trouble is that while Chrysler, say, makes $1,000 a car, G.M. loses nearly $300. That doesn't compute."

White, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, said yesterday that the pipeline leak was months old, but that a dam that was jury-rigged by a Russian oil company to contain the leaking oil apparently burst in the last several days. He said that American industry officials in the remote Komi region of the Arctic reported that the spill had reached a tributary of the Pechora River, near the city of Usinsk, which in warmer months pours into the Arctic Ocean. The spill is continuing to advance, he said."

But out of the Pride at Work conference, as it was called, a national organization has emerged. A leadership group of labor activists gathered in New York again late last month to formally ordain the National Gay/Lesbian/Bi/Transgender Labor Organization, the group's politically inclusive full title. Alas, no acronym dare speak its name, and so the group will be known as Pride at Work. It has a national mailing list of about 600 names.   It may not seem like the most propitious moment for an alliance between the two groups most likely to be marginalized by those who must now be obeyed in Washington. The Democratic debacle is attributed in part to Bill Clinton's support for gay rights and his attempt to change the military's discriminatory sexual orientation policies early in his term. There are undoubtedly those in the union movement, with strong ties to the Democratic Party, who would regard gay rights as a lavender albatross. Supporting those issues, the argument would go, is to risk further alienating the gay-shy electorate."

""It was a very, very traumatic day,"" she said, her blond hair bobbing above the din. ""They said that if they didn't find a buyer or some other arrangement, they would close it on Sept. 6. It hit us pretty hard. I guess we were in denial that this would happen."" And it didn't, thanks to a local bank and a group of entrepreneurs.    For Ms. Barnette, who rose from a sewing machine operator earning $1 an hour 24 years ago to plant manager today, and for the 200 seamstresses here who start at $4.25 an hour, the impending shutdown bordered on the apocalyptic. ""Everybody in this town has some connection with this place,"" she said. ""Really, you had a certain group of people here, this is what they do. This is what they know.""    But the incessant drumbeat of international competition and the imperatives of the plant's owner, the Sara Lee Corporation in Chicago, signaled that the old mill in this north Georgia town of 12,000 was no longer needed, and that another small factory had to go.    Last June, Sara Lee, considered one of the best-managed consumer products companies, announced that to improve profits it would cut the number of plants making knitwear, fleecewear and men's and women's underwear. ""We were getting out of private label apparel manufacture, things like sweatshirts for the Gap, active wear."" said Nancy Young, a spokeswoman. ""We decided to get out and announced this closing in August.""    For the 230, mostly women, employees at the Cartersville factory of Spring City Knitting, a Winston-Salem, N.C., subsidiary of Sara Lee, and the 110 workers at a sister factory in Milledgeville about 120 miles away, unemployment seemed as inevitable as a rushing thunderstorm.    Jerry Kemp, a lean 45-year-old Kentuckian who moved to Cartersville years ago as a Sara Lee vice president, had other ideas. The year before Mr. Kemp and three partners formed Springtown Inc., which bought a former Sara Lee plant in Wrightsville, Ga., where 350 workers made men's underwear.    When news of the closing hit here and at a more modern plant in Midgeville, he agreed to buy them and to try to make a go of all three former Sara Lee plants.    ""I like this area and wanted to raise my family here,"" said Mr. Kemp, the father of two teen-agers. ""I wanted to get into business by myself.""    He approached some friends, who had also spent their careers in the apparel business, and they poured their savings into the company. Mr. Kemp became its president.    ""We all had a good understanding of what it would take to make this work,"" he said, ""but probably the hardest part was putting together the financial package and making this competitive internationally."" He sees tough times ahead for the apparel industry in the United States, particularly as global trade is liberalized.    Indeed, apparel industry employment has fallen 18 percent in the last decade, from 1.185 million workers in 1984 to 970,000 today, according to the American Apparel Manufacturers Association. And over the same period, the association says, apparel imports climbed 159 percent, to $28.2 billion, not including foreign fur, rubber, leather and plastic apparel.    Under an unusual agreement, not yet final, Sara Lee donated the three factories to the state, which plans to enter into a lease-purchase agreement with Mr. Kemp's company, Springtown Inc. Eventually Springtown will own the factories and keep the local workers on the job.    Mr. Kemp and his partners had some misgivings. The Milledgeville plant could quickly make small batches of a wide range of knitwear and active wear and could be profitable. But in Cartersville, ""we decided to take a gamble,"" Mr. Kemp said. ""This is a high-cost operation to run,"" he added. ""It's old. It's not automated. But because of the management, the people, and because we ourselves were here, we decided it was worth taking a chance.""    David Dautel, Springtown's chief financial officer, said that the company had applied for two loans from the state for $250,000 each for the Milledgeville and Cartersville plants. The state grants the money to the localities, which, in turn, lend to the company at below-market rates. The loans are repaid over five to seven years to the localities, which can then relend the money to others.    Putting the deal together involved persuading a nearby bank, the Trust Company Bank of Northwest Georgia, in Rome, that he and his partners could make a go of Sara Lee's old plants.    David Johnson, the bank's senior loan officer, said: ""I'd say the first question we asked was 'If they couldn't do it, why can you?' "" After all, Sara Lee had a reputation for knowing how to run plants efficiently.    But the bank, Mr. Johnson said, was encouraged because Mr. Kemp and his partners had spent their working lives in the business, Sara Lee's existing contracts were inherited by Springtown, the market and cost projections looked good, and interviews with Springtown customers were positive.    ""We asked them who is their primary market,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""If they are making for Russell, that's a pretty strong company. If they're making for Jockey, that's a pretty strong company. We will call the company and ask how comfortable they are with the company -- can they produce a quality product at a competitive price?""    He said that the fact the bank was lending to Springtown in Cartersville, which is on the fringe of its usual business territory, was an expression of confidence. ""Our interest is in Cartersville,"" he said. ""It is a viable employer. It has great potential and is important to the community there.""    While Mr. Kemp wants plants that can produce garments that were not being made by others, he said he was also determined to save jobs, even if it appeared risky. ""They're good people here, and a lot of these jobs are in towns where there's not a lot of opportunity,"" he said. ""Just writing this off is just not right.""    In starting an apparel company, Mr. Kemp and his partners, like mice scampering between the legs of elephants, are trying to find niches in the market and to compete aggressively. It is not easy, he admitted.    ""First,"" he continued, ""our niche is in active wear and underwear, mostly contract manufacture,"" for other labels. ""We want people like the Gap or Jockey or Calvin Klein. When they want a lounge or a fashion kind of underwear, we're the people who come to mind.""    Mr. Dautel, the financial officer, said that the company's expectations for the Cartersville plant hinged on transforming it into an efficient headquarters with a computerized inventory system and into the central distribution point for the company's other two factories.    And while the Georgia plants are the core of his company, Mr. Kemp acknowledged that it needed lower-cost foreign operations to survive. For that, Springtown recently bought a small plant in Honduras. ""Our thinking is long term, we wanted to be both domestic and offshore,"" he said.     Although it is yet early, the company is off to a good start, Mr. Kemp said. ""Business is strong,"" he said. ""We hit it on an upswing. We have a good reputation, and we try to service the business we have well. We've been fortunate. We have people who believe we'll be successful.""    And, he said, the company is depending as well on the strength of its work force. ""The folks in all these plants have been very supportive,"" he said. ""They've hung in there. I wouldn't have even considered it without having them. They're really what makes it happen.""    Ms. Barnette finished her whirl through the factory, from sewing room to inspection tables, to bundling and packaging. ""All in all, it's not a bad place to work, or I wouldn't have stuck around for 24 years,"" she said. ""If this had closed, it would never have opened again."""

The office is, in short, a work in progress, even if ""progress"" is a discredited 19th-century notion. As ""Good Offices and Beyond: The Evolution of the Workplace"" intriguingly demonstrates, there is less distance than one might think between the paper clip and the virtual office.   Anyone who keeps track of events at the Cooper-Hewitt will not be surprised that the museum has mounted a witty, down-to-earth exploration of the connections between design, technology and everyday life. It is in the tradition of last year's ""Mechanical Bride"" exhibit, which examined the historical relationship between emerging household technology and women's work. In addition to its other virtues, ""Good Offices"" encourages participation: Visitors have filled dozens of notebook pages responding to questions on technology, what constitutes a good office -- natural light, many visitors say -- and what work means to them. One room of the exhibit is dedicated to the Laboratory of Seating, where visitors may help test 15 ergonomic office chairs."

Will the pact, as Mr. Clinton said, keep America ""moving forward"" to ""create more high-wage jobs""?

W. Griffith had a Hollywood-shaking idea -- get together some people who know movies and let them run the show. United Artists was born. Since those glory days, though, corporations and committees and accountants have taken over -- and their movies, alas, often look the part. But last week a grand cycle came round again as three men who indisputably know movies now -- Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen -- joined forces to create a studio. The rest of Hollywood may soon look as if a ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaur had tromped through. Mr. Spielberg will stop making films for Universal, Mr. Katzenberg will probably raid the animation talent at Disney, his former home, Mr. Geffen will bring his production unit. And all that talent will flow to the new studio. A Novel Cash-Flow Problem  Every company should have such problems. Chrysler -- yes, the one that almost went under -- has been making so much money it's running out of mattresses to stuff it in. With buyers clamoring for its cars and Cherokees, its earnings reports are getting boring -- another quarter, another record. And again last week: $11.66 billion in revenues, $651 million in profits, both records. So, what to do with it? The company even has all it needs in its pension funds -- the first time since 1957. It could raise the dividend, it could buy back some stock. But it also hasn't forgotten how wet the rainy days can be.  The Car-Buying Minuet  What is it about new cars? When you buy anything else, you shop around, you find the best price, you pay it. Simple. (Or you don't shop around, you pay too much, you kick yourself.) With cars, though, a bizarre world has evolved -- meaningless price tags, complex formulas for figuring what the price should be and the dealer's profit. (But do you know the deli's profit on that bagel and coffee?) And then ""no haggle"" pricing, to make it all nice and simple. But nothing, of course, is simple -- last week it turned out that the Justice Department is investigating the whole idea of no-haggle pricing. What are they looking for? Price-fixing possibly. Or maybe, like the rest of us, they're just trying to figure out what's going on.  Lutece Super-Value Meals?  The bistros come and go, the temples of Tuesday's cuisine vanish by Wednesday. And then there's Lutece, as indestructible as the Brooklyn Bridge. But the bridge shook a bit last week: Andre Soltner sold Lutece. So is it any cause for alarm that the buyer, Ark Restaurants, owns less-illustrious establishments like Albuquerque Eats and B. Smith's? No, insists Ark's president; this pillar of French cuisine will remain intact. But -- a ""but"" always seems to sneak in about now -- ""there may be room for enhancement,"" he said, like a ""Lutece Brasserie somewhere."" Stay off the Brooklyn Bridge. Toys Don't Kill? Think Again  Kids love toy guns; parents hate them. So guess who usually wins out: Toy guns were a $246 million business in this country last year. But parents' vague unease has turned to tangible fear lately, as one New York boy, then another, was shot by a police officer who mistook a toy gun for the real thing. Toys 'R' Us heard those shots loud and clear, and last week it said it would stop selling ""realistic"" toy guns; others, like Kay-Bee Toys, quickly followed suit. Toys 'R' Us had banished toy guns before, but later started selling guns in bright colors -- to mark them as fake. But kids started painting them to look real, so the issue exploded again.  Microsoft, On Top Again  Microsoft clearly intends to be master of everything it touches, and if it can't build what it needs, it won't hesitate to buy it. Its own personal-finance software has managed only 4 percent of the market. But Bill Gates probably can't even see numbers that small, so last week, he had Microsoft issue $1.5 billion in stock -- in the largest software acquisition ever -- to buy Intuit, whose Quicken software owns the market. So if more people take to writing checks and paying bills electronically, Microsoft could just tiptoe in with a tiny transaction fee, then gather those golden crumbs into quite a rich cake indeed. ECONOMY Making Economics a Game  There's a concept in economics called ""perfect competition"" -- the idea that businesses and nations exist in a vast state of nature, and the fittest will prevail by brute, faceless mathematical force. Some economists, though, think it's a bit murkier -- that something called ""game theory"" must be factored in. That theory takes into account the bluff and swagger, the backing and filling, of real-life competition -- a world, in short, in which rivals play a lot of ""games,"" possibly devious ones. Last week this economic school got a powerful blessing when the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to three game-theory pioneers.  Lilco as Politics? Don't Be Silly  There's been talk of a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company for years, especially during the Shoreham mess. But it's naturally just a coincidence that Governor Cuomo proposed a takeover just last week -- a few weeks before his charmed political life could skid to a halt. Certainly it's not politics -- though the takeover would, by the by, lower rates for Lilco customers, among the nation's highest, by about 10 percent. George Pataki -- possibly munching some sour grapes as he witnessed, in living color, the joys of incumbency -- called it ""the height of political opportunism."" But Mr. Cuomo insisted it was ""for the public."" Follow the Bouncing Subsidy  One way to get cheap magazine subscriptions is to accept a cut-rate offer, not renew, then take another introductory offer. Companies could probably play that game, too, hopping from New York to Connecticut and back, following the tax break du jour. Last week, angry that Swiss Bank had been lured to Stamford, Mayor Giuliani started talking tough, saying that a 1991 tristate peace treaty had been broken and he'd start trying to entice companies away from Connecticut. New York, in fact, has just offered Viacom $15 million in tax breaks to stick around. Of course, as a Connecticut official pointed out, the whole region gets hurt by this tax-draining game.  No Inflation for Retirees  Don't mention inflation to people getting Social Security; there's none of it in their paychecks. When the consumer price numbers came in on Friday, the yearly increase added up to just 2.8 percent -- and that instantly became the magic number for 1995 Social Security increases. But for all that talk about lurking inflation, that's the third-smallest increase since the payments were pegged to price rises two decades ago. And the consumer-price data came on top of a surprising decline in producer prices reported the day before -- so, yet again, that feared price pressure isn't showing up on any radar. INTERNATIONAL A Weak Link: The Ruble  Russia's on a tightrope. It has to get its economy moving, but if it tries to do so by overdoing subsidies to business, the resulting inflation will be as destructive as anything else. Last week it took quite a jolt on that tightrope, as currency markets suddenly had big doubts and sent the ruble plummeting by 25 percent against the dollar -- its biggest single drop ever. Russia had made big strides in taming inflation, but this could well send it back to the drawing board. Boris Yeltsin started talking about conspiracies, and heads rolled -- Mr. Yeltsin fired the acting Finance Minister. But it was really just the market, and speculators, at work. The central bank managed to get the ruble to bounce back the next day, but that by no means meant the crisis was over. That was clear on Friday when the head of the central bank resigned. What Now for Mexican Labor?  So now that Nafta has been around a while, what's in store for workers at American-owned plants in Mexico? An answer may be taking shape. With Mexican factory workers lucky to get $16 a day -- about what Americans get an hour -- American unions have been trying to address that disparity. But there have been charges that companies like Honeywell and General Electric have fired union sympathizers, so the unions turned to Labor Secretary Robert Reich to ride to the rescue. But last week Mr. Reich refused to pursue the complaints. And union organizers and companies alike were watching it all very closely."

Well, yes, you do -- to a certain extent. For one thing, even if there's no logical impact on financial markets, investors thought there was -- and those jitters became real losses. But there's concrete damage on one front: the $1 trillion municipal bond market had a safe, squeaky-clean image, but that's gotten quite a blow. So even if your county stayed clear of derivatives, it might now find it costlier to borrow -- and that cost may somehow get passed right along to you.

But the report did not alarm financial markets because the job growth was not strong enough to force the Federal Reserve to move immediately on interest rates.  [ Page 39. ]  While job growth was seen in all regions of the country, the unemployment rate in New Jersey rose to 6.7 percent, from 6 percent. In New York State, the rate fell to 6.2 percent, from 6.9 percent.  [ 47. ] An overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws was approved by the Senate. The measure would set new rules making it easier for individuals to repay their debts on installment plans and harder for big corporate debtors to avoid their creditors.  [ 39. ] Recycling is becoming a big business as economic recovery and greater mill capacity increase demand for raw material. Old corrugated boxes, waste paper, plastics and steel cans have been finding new and lucrative markets.

The licenses for interactive video services will be re-auctioned.  [ 41. ] Markets Stocks rallied. Buyers were encouraged by the employment report, which lessened expectations of an immediate increase in interest rates. The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.77 points.  [ 40. ] Treasury prices rose after the Government reported a rise in payrolls that was below market expectations.  [ 47. ] The dollar strengthened, rising above 100 Japanese yen. The dollar was bolstered by gains in stocks and bonds and by a report showing a reduction in Japan's trade surplus.  [ 48. ] Crude oil prices jumped before falling back. Traders bet a move by Iraqi forces toward Kuwait would not lead to an invasion.  [ 48. ] Your Money Peter Lynch has kept his investment approach startingly simple. Mr. Lynch, who produced huge gains as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund before going into semiretirement four years ago, has made some changes in his own investment portfolio. Now, the renowned stock picker even buys bonds.  [ 37. ] Olde Discount is offering trades without commissions. But there is a catch: the transactions must be in stocks recommended by analysts at the deep discount brokerage firm.  [ 37. ] Citibank customers can buy and sell stocks on cash machines. Citibank, which began offering the service this week, is the first bank in the country to let customers make such trades.

That option, unavailable to the Democrats, was seized on election night by the Union Pacific Corporation, which appeared to be all but certain to lose the pending election for control of the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation.   Union Pacific's latest bid in the contest with Burlington Northern Inc. for railroad supremacy in the West offered to assume all risk that Federal regulators would turn the merger down. It is willing, it said on Tuesday night, to pay for Santa Fe shares now and, if forced to do so, dispose of them later. Santa Fe shareholders would face no risk.   But -- and this is where this election battle gets complex -- Union Pacific is also willing to pay a higher price if it doesn't have to bear that risk. And while it initiated its tender offer last night, it imposed conditions that mean it could withdraw the offer. It is at least possible that Santa Fe shareholders who will vote next week on the Burlington Northern offer could turn it down and then not be able to get anything from Union Pacific for years, if at all.   That risk obviously was not on the minds of traders yesterday who bid up Santa Fe shares, which rose $1.25, to $16, on the New York Stock Exchange. Union Pacific fell $2 a share, to $47.50, while Burlington Northern, after rising early, ended unchanged at $49.375. The market clearly thinks that Union Pacific will likely prevail with its new offer. And it suspects it is overpaying.   Burlington Northern denounced the new Union Pacific offer, but said nothing to rule in or out the possibility of improving its own bid. ""In an effort to avoid an effective competitor, U.P. has now put its shareholders in a risky and vulnerable position,"" Gerald Grinstein, Burlington's chairman and chief executive, said.    The unusually complex takeover fight for Santa Fe reflects the fact that approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission is needed before the railroads can merge. But there is nothing to stop one company from buying the other before the commission acts. The mechanism for doing that is the voting trust, in which the railroads are kept separate even while under common ownership.   That is what Union Pacific proposed on Tuesday. If the merger eventually is viewed as anticompetitive, Union Pacific would then have to dispose of Santa Fe, perhaps taking a sizable loss.   Santa Fe shareholders will vote Nov. 18 on the Burlington Northern offer of Burlington stock now valued at $16.79 a share. That offer cannot be completed without the commission's approval, but Santa Fe officials believe that approval would be forthcoming. They say a Union Pacific takeover would present a much more difficult hurdle because of the higher number of parallel routes that would be combined.   Prior to Tuesday night, Union Pacific had offered $20 a share in Union Pacific stock, contingent on shareholders rejecting the Burlington deal. Union Pacific had rejected a voting trust proposal, instead citing its own experts who argued that the commission would approve a deal. Effectively, Santa Fe's institutional holders said they did not want to take the chance, and suggested that Union Pacific put its money where its mouth was.   At first glance, that appears to be exactly what Union Pacific has done. It is now offering $17.50 in cash and stock for each Santa Fe share, but with a voting trust that will enable it to act without commission approval. It is taking that plan to Santa Fe shareholders through a tender offer.   But Union Pacific has left itself some escape clauses. Though the tender offer goes directly to the shareholders, it is contingent on approval of the Santa Fe board, as well as on shareholder rejection of the Burlington Northern offer.   Why make a hostile offer contingent on board approval? ""We need their cooperation with the I.C.C.,"" said Gary Schuster, a spokesman for Union Pacific. ""We can waive that if we want to, but we probably won't.""   Moreover, even in saying it would go to the shareholders, Union Pacific said it remained ready to make a deal on its previous terms, which offer more money but shift the risk of the commission's disapproval to Santa Fe shareholders, who would have to wait, perhaps for years, to see any cash.   The move by Union Pacific clearly shows it is determined to break up the marriage of two rivals. But it has left itself enough wiggle room that shareholders who vote against the Burlington deal cannot be sure that a better deal will be quickly available."

Yeltsin moved quickly today to try to calm Russians and restore confidence in his Government after Tuesday's extraordinary and embarrassing run on the ruble, which lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar.   While the financial elements to stop the plunge were put into place Tuesday night -- helping the ruble to recover today to 3,736 against the dollar from Tuesday's close of 3,926 -- Mr. Yeltsin also moved politically. He dismissed the acting Finance Minister, Sergei Dubinin, who had little responsiblity for the run on the ruble; called the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, home from vacation, and asked Parliament to dismiss the head of the central bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, a long-time target of market-oriented reformers.   Parliament postponed any vote on the fate of Mr. Gerashchenko, who was silent on the ruble's collapse today, but lawmakers called for a vote of confidence in the Government for Oct. 21.   In time-honored Moscow fashion, Mr. Yeltsin also ascribed what is being called ""Black Tuesday"" to sabotage by unidentified enemies and speculators, and he ordered his National Security Council to work with the secret police to investigate. One Government official even called for an ""unmasking trial,"" the phrase used for the show trials that defined the purges of the Stalin era.   But rather than the work of some secret conspiracy, Tuesday's events seemed to result from a confluence of factors, and traders who saw an opportunity took it. Western diplomats, brokers and business executives said today that a correction in the value of the ruble had been inevitable, if badly controlled. They said the Russian inflation rate remained tolerable and that the panic would not have a lasting effect on investor confidence.   ""I hope there won't be any re-evaluations on the part of investors,"" said Maksim Boyko, director of the Russian Privatization Center. ""But this whole episode underscores the fragility of the stabilization achieved in 1994. The Central Bank should share at least part of the blame.""   Reasons cited to help explain Tuesday's panic included currency speculation, inflationary expectations and a failure of the Government and central bank to act quickly enough to control the market.   After this summer's injection of credits into agriculture and industry, the Government and the central bank have made a coordinated effort to allow the ruble to adjust to higher inflation by slipping gradually from the 2,000 or so to the dollar of early this summer to about 3,000 or even 3,500 to the dollar, the rate at which the 1995 budget is figured.    Although Russians have enjoyed a relatively low inflation rate since August 1993, when inflation stood at 26 percent a month, the monthly rate has increased from about 4 percent in June to about 8 percent in September. (The monthly rate in the United States in August was three-tenths of a percent, about average for recent months.)    Since there is normally a three-month lag here between the release of new credits and an increase in the inflation rate, the estimated 7 trillion rubles of credits issued in July and August, and perhaps 3 trillion more issued in September, will continue to keep inflation running higher. In response to this expectation of continuing price increases, traders have been buying dollars, which has pushed the ruble down for three weeks now.   During the last three months, the Russian Central Bank has spent $2 billion of its reserves of Western currency to support and stabilize the ruble. Wary of spending too much, the bank announced last month that it would lessen its support of the ruble in the foreign exchange markets. On Monday and Tuesday, the bank bought few rubles, doing so only late on Tuesday to prevent the ruble from crashing past the 4,000 to the dollar.    With Mr. Chernomyrdin on vacation, the Government seemed paralyzed and said nothing. Only after trading ended on Tuesday -- followed by a reportedly stormy Government meeting -- did Mr. Gerashchenko of the central bank announce a sharp rise in short-term interest rates to make ruble holdings more attractive and declare that the bank would support the ruble at the start of trading today.   But with outstanding credits, unpaid salaries and a significant budget deficit to finance, economists and diplomats say, the Government had wanted a weaker ruble so that it would take fewer dollars to pay for it all. A weaker ruble also helps protect Russia's domestic industry by making imports more expensive, a demand that is frequently made by farm and industrial lobbies.   During a parliamentary debate today, Mr. Dubinin said that the panic was directly linked to recent subsidies to agriculture and defense industries. ""Now we have to decide what we want -- either stabilization of finances with lower inflation or further subsidies to bankrupt enterprises,"" he said. If the latter, ""the ruble will continue to fall.""   Adding to the panic on Tuesday, bankers said, was a successful effort by a group of commercial banks, hurting from bad loans made when inflation was much higher, to manipulate the rules of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, or Micex, where the ruble is traded.   As one board member explained it, banks have been allowed to buy dollars and put up the rubles to cover their purchase two days later, a common international practice. But numerous banks, he said, bought dollars and then delayed payment up to four days, waiting until Tuesday night, when the ruble was at its lowest, to cover their purchases.   Now the exchange will return to the old method of requiring money to be deposited before any trade is approved, he said, to discourage currency speculation.    Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank, said today that the last few days would not change the fundamental attractiveness of Russia as a place for foreign investment.   ""Interest in investing here is definitely a new trend, and it's not a blip on the radar screen,"" Mr. Lindbaek said. ""In this kind of environment, one should expect the currency market to be volatile. If we should go to hyperinflation, that would be different. But the stabilization policy of the Government is correct and necessary, and it is in fact taking hold.""   Average Russians, who saw prices for imported goods and even some domestic items zoom up during the course of a day, offered opinions ranging from imminent ruin to bemused shrugs.   Olga, a world-weary 24-year-old who works at the Voyazh kiosk in central Moscow, where a pack of Marlboros went from 1,900 rubles to 2,500 rubles and a Snickers bar from 1,000 rubles to 1,500 in hours, said: ""Of course we've hiked our prices. But no one's complaining except the grannies.""    Leonid Abalkin, a well-known reform economist of the Gorbachev period, said people trusted the dollar more than their leaders. ""In contrast to the Russian Government,"" he said, ""the U.S. dollar will not let you down or deceive you.""   Irina, who sells soaps and cosmetics at the Kabul department store nearby, said they had nearly doubled prices overnight, and there were fewer customers than usual. ""We understand what has happened better than anyone,"" she said. ""We understand it with our pockets."""

Over the long stretch of history, we are told, stocks produce an average return of about 10 percent a year. The academic studies prove nothing else does as well.   That belief in this is growing can be seen in the mutual fund industry's boom. The stock market may have done nothing this year, but three of the four best months ever for stock mutual funds -- in terms of net cash flow from investors -- were in 1994. Investors have put more money into stock funds than they took out for 48 consecutive months. To put that in perspective, the industry's old record was 12 months, a string that ended with the 1987 crash."

Variable life policies have grown rapidly in recent years because they allow policyholders to invest the cash portion of their premiums in mutual funds rather than in the insurer's general account, made up chiefly of bonds. The policies have one main drawback -- high expenses.  The combination of sales commissions, insurance charges, administrative costs and money management fees can cut sharply into returns. Typically, ""a projected return of 12 percent over a period of 20 years turns into 8 percent once the expenses are paid,"" said James H. Hunt, an actuary and a director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization in Alexandria, Va.   Last month, the Security Benefit Life Insurance Company of Topeka, Kan., introduced a low-load, or low commission, version of variable life insurance. American Life Insurance of New York, has quietly begun offering a similar product. And Ameritas Life, of Lincoln, Neb., plans to bring out its own version early next year.  ""Anybody who is shopping for life insurance ought to consider one of these low-load variable life policies,"" said Glenn Daily, author of ""The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Insurance Products.""  The low-load products, which are sold by phone instead of by insurance sales agents, have one distinct advantage. The sales commission on a traditional load product generally eats up most, if not all, of the first year's premium, leaving a cash balance near zero at the end of one year. But the cash value of a low-load product is about the same as the premium paid after one year.  Security Benefit's product comes with eight investment fund choices, all managed by the company. American Life has 14 investment options, including funds managed by Scudder, Twentieth Century and Calvert. Its variable policy is available now in New York but will be sold in several states by the end of the month.  Ameritas, also licensed in New York, plans to offer 11 mutual fund choices from two no-load fund groups, said Gay Yellen, vice president of Veritas, a Houston-based unit of the insurer. The performance of all the policies' underlying investments is very important, of course, since saving money on commission is futile if the policyholder fails to make money on the investment.  Security Benefit, which is seeking New York approval for its product, sells its policy through fee-only planners, some of whom are represented by the Wholesale Insurance Network of Tampa, Fla. Consumers who call the network are referred to a financial consultant, who might charge $100 an hour for advice, said Keith Maurer, president of the network. Buying a variable policy ""should cost $250, at most,"" he said.  Mr. Maurer and his staff will also sell no-load policies for no fee to people who do not need advice on coverage or investments. The network receives a monthly fee from the 30 insurance companies it represents.  Just because an insurance policy does not carry a sales commission, however, does not mean it is a good deal. Other charges include mortality expenses, or the cost to pay death benefits; administrative charges, and in the case of variable life, investment management fees.  For Security Benefit's product, these other expenses are quite high. The charge for mortality and expense risk is nine-tenths of one percent. ""That is the maximum that companies can charge,"" Mr. Daily said.  Still, a full analysis of the Security Benefit product shows it is quite competitive with policies sold on commission, said Mr. Hunt, whose organization will analyze policies for consumers for a fee.  He examined a Security Benefit policy with a death benefit of $100,000 and an annual premium of $1,200, and another policy that had a $500,000 benefit and a premium of $12,000. Security Benefit applied all charges as a percentage of assets, no matter the policy size, Mr. Hunt said. Noting that most companies charge higher expenses for small policies, he said that Security Benefit offers the most attractive variable policy for $100,000 that he has seen.  For comparison, he pointed to a $100,000 variable life policy from Prudential that his 35-year-old daughter had considered. The policy was illustrated to show 12 percent annual returns. His analysis showed the annual return after expenses to be about 8 percent over 20 years.  For the Security Benefit policy, which was illustrated by the company to show a 9 percent return, the return after expenses was 6.6 percent over 20 years, he said. The difference, known as the spread, was just 2.4 percentage points on the Security Benefit policy, compared with 4 points on the Prudential policy. ""I have not seen a policy with such a narrow spread,"" Mr. Hunt said. ""Clearly, the low load affords substantial savings for that policy.""  Security Benefit's low-load policy is simply the first, and it is too soon to tell how it will stack up against products from American Life, Ameritas and other companies. Investors who buy a low-load policy, however, can rest assured that they can change course without paying a big penalty. ""Since there is no front-end charge and no surrender charge, you can just buy it and drop it later if you decide it didn't perform well,"" Mr. Daily said. Taking Agents Out of the Game    HAVING started with universal and whole life, several low-load insurance companies are branching out.  Their latest foray, into variable life insurance, is welcomed by many planners and insurance advisers. The reason: low-load policies have a low sales charge.  ""We've all been so anxious to have some low-load options in variable life because it's so expensive,"" said James H. Hunt, a director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization in Alexandria, Va.  The remaining gaps in the low-load market will probably be filled in a couple of years, said Glenn Daily, a fee-only insurance adviser.  ""We need a low-load disability policy offered by one of the big players like Paul Revere or Unum and we need a few more variable life products,"" Mr. Daily said. ""But we're almost to the point that you don't ever need to deal with an agent again."""

Prices of the longer maturities declined as some investors sold bonds and turned to the short end of the market to wait out current jitters. The investors were concerned that a falling dollar would discourage foreign investors from buying United States debt securities. The dollar was affected by worries about the possible impact of the financial crisis in Mexico."

But despite general agreement about the desirability of lowering barriers to trade, which is to be the centerpiece of the first Western Hemisphere summit meeting since 1967, there were plenty of signs already that Latin American officials remain skeptical of United States intentions on trade."

This may be so. Certainly, inhabitants of the liberal sanctuaries accustomed to being out of step with the rest of the country are asking themselves how many times in one life they will have to ponder moving to Canada. For now they are just pulling raincoats tight around their ""Great Society counter-cultural McGovern-ik"" T-shirts and poring over David McCullough's ""Truman,"" looking for nuggets that might help the First Boomer. President Clinton may be no liberal's idea of a liberal, but in the Damien-gone-respectable context of Newt Gingrich, even to the die-hards in Berkeley, Cambridge and New York, he must now look pretty good.    Is it churlish to note that many of the people who say they feel burdened by Big Government are in a position to be so because they, or their parents and grand-parents, were its principal beneficiaries? Collective memory is an Etch-a-Sketch, easily erased. Barely 60 years have passed since the Government's response to the Great Depression reshaped the American social compact, redistributing wealth and creating opportunities for the dispossessed and disenfranchised, or as the phrase of the time put it, ""one third of the nation."" True, as liberal critics would point out, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal missed a lot of people but it did put the ""upward"" back in mobility for millions of Americans. It also set a standard for government activism -- particularly in protecting the rights of workers -- that lasted until it ran into a stone wall called Reagan."
