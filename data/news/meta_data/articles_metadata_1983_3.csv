Operating losses were cut dramatically, to a total of $55.1 million, from $269.9 million in the second quarter of 1982, and from $116 million in the first quarter of this year.   As a result, the sense of impending doom within the industry has lifted. It has become far less likely that Federal and state regulatory authorities will force mergers of failing institutions into stronger ones."

In a day of voting seen as the first significant test of opinion on the one- year-old Kohl Government, the Social Democrats also strengthened their majority in the legislature of the small northern state of Bremen, which has the highest level of unemployment in the country.   Both states are traditional Social Democratic strongholds, and politicians were reluctant to draw sweeping conclusions about national politics from the two regional elections. But the conservative Kohl Government, now confronting difficult foreign and economic policy decisions, was hardly bolstered by the results."

''Evidence that recovery is under way is now quite clear in the U.S., and detectable - though less so and with some important differences among countries - elsewhere in the O.E.C.D.,'' Sylvia Ostry, the organization's chief economist, told a news conference when she introduced the new forecasts. The projections were contained in The Economic Outlook, the group's semiannual review of Western economic policy.   But the O.E.C.D. warned that the uneven recovery now beginning in the West was still vulnerable to high American interest rates and weak demand that threaten to choke off the revival of industrial investment that is necessary if the recovery is to become selfsustaining."

More than a million Chinese have been mobilized to patrol along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze day and night to to prevent it from bursting its banks and covering the surrounding countryside, the New China News Agency quoted a spokesman from the central flood control headquarters as saying.   They include 43,000 soldiers and civilians working on the dikes, which were reinforced several years ago at a cost of about $10 million. The water level is said to be the second highest at Wuhan and downriver in 29 years."

A jouncing 50-mile ride along a dirt road from the nearest highway brings you to a community that is centered on a plaza dominated by a scrubbed white church, with its steeple rising over clusters of terra-cotta roofs.

It was the first time since the mid 1970's that General Dynamics' F-16 had won an international competition over the F-18, made jointly by the Northrop Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.   In St. Louis, General Dynamics said that while it had not yet been told officially, it understood that it had won and that negotiations between the United States and Turkey would be held over the next three months."

Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, who became the provisional President of Guatemala today, is a career army officer with a reputation for devotion to the military and to its hard-line solutions to the country's problems.  His ascension to power is expected to result in a change less in substance than in the style of the Government, which has been run for the last 17 months by Brig.Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, whose moralistic attitude had increasingly angered military officers, businessmen and politicians.   What are not expected to change under General Mejia Victores are policies that have been bitterly attacked by human rights organizations. As Defense Minister, General Mejia Victores helped preside over a campaign against leftist guerrillas that has drawn criticism for causing the deaths of thousands of civilians and for routing hundreds of thousands from their homes."

The bishops' letter, titled ''A Message to the People of God,'' condemned as immoral the President's power to have people imprisoned without the right of appeal to any court.   Msgr. Dexter H. Irisari, a spokesman for the 109-member Bishops' Conference, said the letter was withdrawn several hours after the presidential palace announced that the ''presidential commitment order'' had been abolished."

Some in the business, like Henry Siegel, chairman of Lexington Broadcast Services, and Robert L. Turner, president, think that time is close at hand.   ''And, if we are successful,'' said Mr. Turner, ''the advertisers will have to ask, 'Why do we need the networks?' Producers will have to ask, 'Are there other places I can go if I can't get a satisfactory deal?' ''   You might call Mr. Turner a recent convert expressing all of the usually strong convictions of a convert, since he joined Mr. Siegel at the Grey Advertising subsidiary only a year ago from the sinking CBS Cable, where he was vice president and general manager. And he recently also became president of the newly formed Advertiser Syndicate Television Association, with 15 members, going on 30. Its function, he explained, ''is to get advertisers to think about syndication and help educate the agencies about it.''"

According to the suit, the two men improperly changed the bylaws of the institute in 1971 to allow them to gain control after Hughes died.

The major targets of the campaign are intellectuals, writers and artists, largely supportive of the banned Solidarity union, who have steadfastly refused to give allegiance to the Government of Gen.

Polish intellectuals were taken aback by two recent articles in the Communist Party daily newspaper, Trybuna Ludu, which attacked virtually every important living Polish writer by name.

The commission's decision, which could be overridden by Congress, is designed to end the nearly 50-year-old practice of using the revenues from long-distance service to subsidize local telephone service, so that its rates could be kept low enough to be affordable by nearly everyone.   Growing competition in providing long-distance telephone service, and the coming breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, has made the subsidy an obstacle to lower rates for the competing long-distance carriers. The F.C.C. ruling yesterday orders that the subsidies be phased out after the first of the year. The new line charges, in effect, would convert the subsidies into higher local rates."

The uncertainty centers on the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market - the most closely watched interest rate in the United States financial markets.   When the funds rate falls, as it has in the last week, it could be a sign that the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy and making funds more available to the banking system.

But the investment advisers, seeking to make money, not science, focus on ''expectations,'' that is, the expectations and moods of the market, however difficult these may be to measure or incorporate in systematic models."

The losses came despite the profitability of U.S. Steel's Marathon Oil Company subsidiary, whose revenue of $2.3 billion accounted for more than half of U.S. Steel's total revenue of $4.4 billion in the quarter. Marathon had $290 million in earnings in the quarter, up from $266 million in last year's period.   This year's $112 million second-quarter loss for U.S. Steel compares with a profit in last year's second quarter of $4 million, or 5 cents a share, on revenue of $5.1 billion. In this year's first quarter, the company lost $118 million."

The paper said the Korean 747 had lowered its flaps at a critical moment of the pursuit, trying to make a Soviet fighter overshoot and allow the airliner to ''slip away.''

Mr. Shilowitz, who had berthed the boat at a shipyard here since he began sailing in the 1960's, wanted to moor it where he could work on it himself, something the fire insurance policies of most shipyards would prevent.   And he wanted to stay in the Greenport area, which he considers one of the Northeast's finest harbors because of its proximity to and protection from the sea.   He was stumped until, doodling one day in his kitchen, he hit upon a solution: combine the needs of his sloop with his family's desire for a second home. It was a way, as he put it during a tour of the area, to resolve ''the dilemma of owning a leisure home remote from my commitment to sailing.'' And, he felt, it was a solution that could be attractive to others."

Brezhnev, the downing of a Korean Air Lines 747 presented the Kremlin with a crisis for which it had no explanation or rationale worked out in advance.  Soviet leaders were forced to respond fast, and their reflexes - their claims, evasions, charges and disclosures - may have revealed more about their system than about what led to the decision to destroy a civilian airliner, resulting in the deaths of 269 people.   From all that has been said here in defense of the action, it seems as if the Kremlin dismissed from the outset the option of accepting responsibility or apologizing, thus buttressing the image presented by diplomatic and other experts on the Soviet Union both here and abroad of a state incapable of admitting error.   Throughout all their explanations, the Soviet leaders have weaved in the notion that the West would surely have done what the Soviet Union did.   Those leaders may be aware that Americans might have acted differently. But in their efforts to field a version of the incident that absolves them of blame and in their notion that the mysteries surrounding the flight would arouse universal suspicion, the leaders seemed to share in the presumption that the world outside is essentially like their world."

While that decline eased pressure on the Fed to tighten credit and possibly drive up interest rates, and while it reduced the possibility of a sharp clash between the central bank and the Reagan Administration, which has been warning the Fed against a tightening of credit, the short-term outlook for monetary policy remains highly uncertain.   That is because the money supply has grown to levels far above the Fed's target rate in a period when the economic recovery has been stronger than most economists and officials had expected. As a result, while there is less concern that a tightening of credit will abort the recovery, there is increasing concern that an excessively rapid increase in the money supply will rekindle inflation.   The markets thus are focusing their attention on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the arm of the Federal Reserve System that sets monetary policy."

Troops of all four contingents came under fire yesterday, and United States and British sources said there was little chance that the Lebanese Army would be able to find and destroy the Shiite guerrillas in the hills.   The retention of the peacekeeping force in its present defense positions under fire and without being able to do much about it, one source said, is bound to raise morale problems among the troops.   The marines, who number 1,200, do not appear to have sufficient strength to mount offensive actions on their own. Aside from their helicopter gunships and 155-millimeter artillery, which were used Monday and Tuesday against Shiite positions, they have a limited ability to hit back at mortar batteries, machine-gun nests and snipers. The other units in the multinational force do not have heavy weapons."

Mr. Reagan also promised to fight inflation and to reduce the burden of Government regulation. There, too, he has delivered.   These initiatives - on taxes, inflation and regulation - are the tenets of Reaganomics, a contradictory blend of orthodox conservative ideology and little-tested theories of supply-side economics. Cutting income tax rates across the board was meant to encourage saving and investment, a cornerstone of supply-side theory, which holds that growth begins more with industrial expansion than through buoyant spending on the demand, or consumer, side.   Today the President can argue that Reaganomics works. In apparent testimony to his success, the economy of late has been bursting with the blossoms of even greater growth than Mr. Reagan had predicted.  Indeed, with prices stable and factory production, automobile sales, consumer spending and house building all on the rebound, the President this week had to raise his estimate for 1983 economic growth for the second time."

In South Korea this fundamental bankers' art is not highly developed. The reason is that for the last two decades Korean banks have been essentially instruments of Government policy, funneling money into industries marked for rapid expansion.   ''Korean banks were public corporations without incentives to innovate and become more efficient,'' said Kim Mahn-je, president of the KorAm Bank. ''But things have changed. From now on, the banks will have to start acting more like banks.''"

With sustained growth at the pace of the second quarter, the economy would likely begin to overheat, putting upward pressure on prices and reigniting inflation sometime in 1984."

Workers at the company's Hayward headquarters were called into meetings with managers and told that ''everyone was being laid off except for a few kept on to clean up,'' said Craig Moore an assembler for the past year."

Aquino Jr., the slain opposition leader, was buried tonight after a 10-and- a-half-hour funeral procession that passed through crowds that the police said totaled a million people.    Despite the press of the mourners, there was no violence as the cortege made its way along a 19-mile route to a cemetery on the southern outskirts of Manila. But in the capital itself, several hundred youths, hurling rocks and crude bombs, rushed to within 500 yards of the presidential palace shortly after nightfall. They were repulsed by the police and Government troops, who turned water cannons on them, charged with riot sticks and fired what appeared to be warning shots.    (A 23-year-old student was fatally shot   and 18 people were wounded in the street fighting, police spokesmen reported, according to The Associated Press. At least eight of the wounded were said to be between 14 and 20 years old.)"

Nearly a year later, however, the pressure on those rates is upward and the market has turned jittery.   In recent days, long-term rates have hit their highest levels since last autumn, propelled in part by the nation's economic recovery and in part by the huge Federal budget deficit.   The dollar, meanwhile, has been pushed to new highs against many foreign currencies by investors anxious to take advantage of high interest yields in the United States.   All this activity is making interest rates and their direction one of the hottest topics in the financial community. The New York Times interviewed 10 of the nation's leading economists for their views.  Milton Friedman    Economist    Interest rates will rise as an inevitable consequence of the monetary explosion we've experienced over the past year.  So far as the economy is concerned, rising rates will in the short run have no impact, because the recovery will continue vigorously through 1983. But it will threaten the continuation of the recovery in 1984. There is nothing that can reverse that trend at the moment; it's all in the pipeline. And there's nothing good that can be done, only a choice among bad things."

For more actively traded Treasury issues, prices fell about oneeighth point for those due in four years and less, while 10-year notes were down more than a quarter point, and long-term bonds were down about three-fourths of a point.   ''Most investors decided to stay on the sidelines and wait for the financing announcement,'' analysts at Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. said in a commentary they publish daily.   While the Merrill Lynch analysts forecast a financing package of $6.75 billion of three-year notes, $5 billion of 10-year notes and $3.75 billion of 30-year bonds, other analysts said that the amount of any specific issue could vary by $250 million, up or down, from those estimates."

The counterattack has led to a lively debate on the issue between a Congressional committee, the Netherlands Antilles and top officials of the Internal Revenue Service.   The debate has a direct bearing on deadlocked negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands Antilles on proposed changes in a tax treaty between the two. Changes in the 20-year-old treaty would affect not only the Antilles, but also more than 200 large American corporations that have raised tens of billions of dollars abroad by issuing Eurobonds through finance subsidiaries located in the Antilles."

Doe of Liberia said today that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, was sending bribes, terrorists and ammunition throughout Africa in an effort to overthrow governments and take over the continent.    ''Qaddafi is a man who, I think, would like to lead the whole continent of Africa, which is impossible to do,'' President Doe said in an interview. ''But he uses his marginal resources in terms of arms and ammunition, spreading explosives all over the continent."

They said Mr. Assad's strong refusal raises questions about Syrian intentions.   ''You have to assume the worst, given the history of cease-fires in Lebanon,'' a United Nations official said, ''and I have to assume in this case that Assad is looking to cause trouble. He probably looks upon the cease-fire as a pause in trying to overthrow Gemayel.''"

That's when the first of some $200 million worth of advertising begins to appear.   And by that time the public - the TV-viewing public at least - will have been prepared for its coming by the reappearance on Sept. 9 of the mighty Lee A. Iacocca, chairman and corporate savior. He'll be back on the tube after an absence of about six months and with four new auto products as a backdrop. He'll note the repayment of Chrysler's Government-backed loans and comment on Chrysler's leadership in technology."

But White Plains, which has evolved in the last decade from a somewhat seedy county seat into a major office and retail center, figures it may need that many rooms.   Through an aggressive urban renewal program, the city's residential communities were stabilized and its downtown was largely rebuilt. The success of that program, through which $100 million of public money has been spent, has been a magnet for commercial investment. Major corporations such as General Foods, I.B.M. and New York Telephone are situated in White Plains, and a dozen others are in the vicinity."

AND THE CITY: OBLIGATION, OPPORTUNITY AND IRRITATION","  With mutual suspicion, misunderstandings and occasional hostility, the United Nations and its host, New York City, have pursued an elusive goal of peaceful coexistence for 37 years. By all accounts, the results have been a mix of love, hate, tolerance and indifference.   As perceived by many New Yorkers, diplomatic immunity has meant a kind of license for United Nations personnel to park illegally, ignore bills and legal summonses, scoff at lawsuits, walk away from criminal charges and behave with haughty insensitivity.   As perceived by many United Nations diplomats, the cosmopolitan city has been surprisingly xenophobic, a place of noise, dirt, discourtesy, crime, outrageous prices and discrimination ranging from landlords who refuse rentals to racial slurs and bumper stickers proclaiming: ''Get the U.N. out of the U.S.''   But the city and its international diplomatic community have also brought each other mutual benefits whose loss, if the United Nations were to leave New York, would have a ''devastating impact,'' in the opinion of Gillian Martin Sorensen, who heads the New York City Commission for the United Nations."

But this asset, which   can easily represent tens of thousands of dollars in stored value, has traditionally been a highly illiquid one that could be tapped only through sale or a costly second mortgage.   Some brokerage firms and banks, however, have recently developed what are generally referred to as home equity loans - a form of credit that allows individuals to use their homes quickly and simply as collateral when borrowing. While these variable-rate loans may be packaged as a revolving line of credit or in another legal format, they are secured by the borrower's home - and are thus similar to a second mortgage."

The notices stem from legislation intended to cut the Government's Medicare bill. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, in amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Social Security Act, stipulates that Medicare will no longer be the insurer of first resort for older employees. Instead, private insurance plans of employers will pick up medical bills first and then Medicare will pay whatever remaining expenses qualify for coverage. The change, which is retroactive to Jan. 1, is expected to save the Government $1.48 billion through fiscal year 1985 by transferring the primary insurance bill to the private sector. Overall benefits for older employees who continue all of their existing coverage ''generally will not be reduced,'' said Herbert M. Pollock, an official at the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers Medicare. But older workers are now faced with key decisions about what health insurance they should carry. For some, the cost of their premiums may rise. The new law requires that employers of 20 or more persons must give older workers, and their spouses age 65 through 69, the option to select several different forms of health coverage. They can choose their employer's private health plan, Medicare Part B (the voluntary part of Medicare) or both."

A Cuban journalist, analyzing the remark later, suggested it was a message to those who believed that the Soviet Union, Cuba's economic underwriter, was also responsible for the defense of Cuba and its military involvement abroad.   The crowd listening to the President applauded most enthusiastically at such references to the country's self-reliance.  Mr. Castro dwelt on what he said was an ''atmosphere of terror'' the United States was trying to create around Nicaragua, asserting it was seeking to deploy troops in Central America through military maneuvers now beginning in the region. He made no direct reference to the role of the Soviet Union in Cuba's development until he came to a series of fraternal greetings at the end of his speech."

Mr. Mitterrand made his views known in an interview with Le Monde.

The United Nations draft consumer protection guidelines are about to be considered by governments in the Economic and Social Council.  This council, a principal organ of the United Nations composed of member states representing all regions of the world and different economic systems, requested the draft guidelines on consumer protection in 1981."

The Soviet commitment to a new five-year pact with the United States, providing for purchases of 9 million to 12 million tons annually, was announced last week, and was widely viewed by these experts as a political gesture to the Reagan Administration.    But agricultural attaches at Western embassies here say that diplomatic considerations dovetailed with the needs of a Soviet economy that is only just beginning to recover from a disastrous succession of four bad harvests.   If the current Soviet harvest meets the United States Department of Agriculture estimate of 200 million tons, it will be the first reasonably good yield since the bumper year of 1978, when the Russians reported a total of 237 million tons."

Baumol Competition Vs. Research,"  William J. Baumol is a professor of economics at Princeton and New York universities and has been a consultant to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and others. Leonard Silk is on vacation.  MANY economists advocate vigorous competition as the most effective means to get to consumers the mix of products they want at the lowest sustainable prices. Deregulation of transportation by air, trucks and railroads, for instance, has been promoted in the belief that most of these markets are now reasonably competitive, and that substitution of competition for regulation serves the public interest.   However, competition, like virtually all good things, incurs some social costs that are usually overlooked. If businesses are forced to vie with each other in charging the lowest possible prices for similar products, they will have nothing left over for nonbusiness-related expenditures."

The increase indicates that recovery in the third quarter may be almost as strong as in the second quarter, when the G.N.P.  soared 8.7 percent after adjustment for inflation. Most economists would be concerned if such rapid growth continues, fearing it might reignite inflation sometime in 1984. It remains unclear, however, how much the recovery may be slowed by tighter credit, higher interest rates and projections of continuing huge budget deficits. (Page A1.) As one sign of a possible slowdown, officials reported new housing construction fell 0.6 percent in July. (D6.)    The Government may be losing millions of dollars a year because the I.R.S. is not enforcing a ban on late corporate deposits of weekly payroll taxes. In one instance, a Norton Simon unit acknowledged having made late deposits for about three years before the I.R.S. asked it, a year ago, to obey the ban. (D1.)"

''These sorts of things happen reasonably often,'' said Brian D. Young, a vice president in the mergers and acquisitions department at the First Boston Corporation.

The tactic often eliminated soldiers from the war as effectively as would a bullet.

The Atari Democrats - who have championed the cause of economic growth through extensive use of computer, robotic and semiconductor technology - are no longer alone. Their ranks have been enlarged by what could only be called Atari Republicans - led by President Reagan himself.

The first red-and-white Middle East Airlines Boeing 707 touched down at 4:45 P.M., a few hours after a security committee representing Lebanon's various warring factions agreed there should be no more shelling of the airport so it could be reopened to civilian traffic. The airport, which is protected by American marines, had been closed by fighting since Aug. 28.   The jetliner had been on its way from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to Larnaca, Cyprus. About 45 minutes before it was due to land, the Beirut control tower radioed Capt. Adnan Chatila and told him to forget about Cyprus and to ''come home,'' the captain said."

As a result, international precious and base metals dealers and brokers have been notified that, just for today, Comex's gold futures ring will open at 10 A.M.; silver, 10:05 A.M., and copper, 10:10 A.M.

But a very faulty impression is left by the uncritical acceptance of the Washington Supreme Court decision holding that public utility units in the state lacked authority to sign the ''take-or- pay'' contracts on which the security of Projects 4 and 5 bonds was based.   In our Federal system the highest state court, unfortunately in this instance, has the final power to rule on interpretation of the statutes of its state. As a result this decision is final, but that does not mean that it is ''right'' or ''correct.'' Accordingly I wish to take exception to the statement that the opinion of the New York law firm of Wood & Dawson, the supply system's legal counsel, upholding the authority of the major units to sign the ''take-or-pay'' contracts ''turned out to be wrong.''"

Indicative of the market's fast-changing mood, the industrial average on Monday moved from an early 20-point gain to a 10-point loss at the close, in the wake of rumors that the Federal Reserve had miscalculated its money supply numbers. That brought a denial from the Fed, but it failed to impart any sense of direction to what seemed essentially a market without a rudder."

Among those questioning the panel's impartiality was Mr. Aquino's widow, Corazon, who spent her first full day in the Philippines after three years of self-imposed exile in the United States that she had shared with her husband. All five commission members, she complained at a news conference, were ''Marcos men.''   Other opposition figures were especially troubled by President Ferdinand E. Marcos's selection of the Supreme Court Chief Justice, Enrique Fernando, to head the investigation. Justice Fernando is a Marcos appointee and loyalist, and critics accused him of having weakened the Supreme Court's independence during the several years he has directed it."

Now, however, there is pizza-flavored popcorn, watermelon-flavored popcorn and taco-flavored popcorn, and the stores that sell them are called gourmet shops in the industry.   During the past two years, a wave of these stores, some selling as many as 60 flavors, has spread throughout the country, becoming the latest fast- food franchising trend.   In New York City there are nine such stores; two years ago there were none. ''Multiflavor is the biggest thing to hit the popcorn industry in my recollection,'' said Dave Evans, president of Gold Medal Products, a leading manufacturer of popcorn popping machines, ''and I've been in the business 35 years.''"

From his suite atop Santiago's tallest skyscraper, which he himself built just two years ago, Mr. Vial presides over a tottering empire of more than 50 mines, farms, paper mills, factories, fishing fleets, retail chains and other enterprises. The Government has taken over management of his bank and mutual funds, yet he remains certain that he will not only be able to stay out of jail, but that one day the group he forged will re-emerge as a powerful financial force.   ''If you were to liquidate our assets today, you would find that they would not produce enough money to pay off our $650 million in debts,'' the 49-year-old Mr. Vial conceded in an interview this week. ''But in a space of 3 to 10 years from now, we will be in a position to meet all our obligations and begin showing profits again.''"

No one questions the need to embargo technology that has obvious military applications. But there is much disagreement over the advisability of selling to Communist countries technology of more general use, particularly that needed to develop energy resources.   One school of thought, strongly represented in the Departments of Commerce and State, regards embargoes on energy equipment as not only futile but also counterproductive. It is in the interest of the West, so the argument runs, to assist the Soviet Union in developing its rich oil and gas deposits, partly to bring down international energy prices and partly to dissuade Moscow from invading the Middle East in search of needed oil. In any event, the United States is unable to stem the flow of energy equipment to the U.S.S.R. because most of it is available in Western Europe and Japan."

But he says in the magazine's August-September issue: ''I do not believe that it is the press's job to discipline itself about what information it receives, or to reject information it can obtain, on the ground that it might harm a negotiation.

Large investor-owned utilities that have hydroelectric plants tend to spread the savings inherent in such generation to all their customers, thus keeping their average charges a bit lower than those set by utilities more dependent on oil- or gas-fueled plants.  Municipal utilities that may now buy more of the water-powered plants tend to have many fewer customers; any savings might thus benefit fewer customers."

But who would have thought that Chrysler's stock, written off by analysts as a dog in 1981 after trading as low as $3, would rise from the dead - it closed at $25.50 on Friday - and become one of Wall Street's biggest winners this year?   Or consider International Harvester, the troubled maker of farm machinery and construction equipment. In August 1981, the prognosis on Wall Street was that Harvester might not survive the year. Negotiations with lenders, however, enabled the company to carry on. Since then, its stock has risen from a low of $2.75 last year to $8.88 now."

''As far as I'm concerned, that agreement has been abrogated many times by the Soviet Union and Cuba in the bringing in of what can only be considered offensive weapons, not defensive, there,'' the President said to a group of reporters.   His spokesman, Larry Speakes, later said the President was referring to violations of the ''spirit of the agreement,'' an agreement that had essentially focused on nuclear weapons. Mr. Speakes did not cite specific violations, but said that the United States has no plans to abrogate its half of the agreement, which was not to invade Cuba.   Mr. Reagan gave his interpretation of the agreement in response to a question about Soviet-Cuban activity in the hemisphere. The 1962 settlement was never agreed to in writing by President Kennedy and Prime Minister Nikita S. Khrushchev or their representatives. The absence of a document and the ambiguity of the meaning of ''offensive'' has led to continuing disputes in the United States Government and with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, it has been generally agreed that the terms applied only to nuclear weapons or weapons with a nuclear capacity."

The Brazilian Government did not say from whom it would seek the new loans.

The announcement that Mr. Langoni would visit the United States came less than 24 hours after Brazil reached a tentative agreement with the International Monetary Fund on the terms of a new and tougher austerity program.

Americans sternly criticized the Canadian Government's nationalist moves to discriminate against foreign oil companies, tighten restrictions on foreign investment and adopt an overall industrial policy that seemed to further political aims at the expense of foreign economic interests.   For its part, Ottawa viewed these policies as something of a lastditch attempt to reverse American dominance of several of the nation's key economic sectors.   Foreigners, principally Americans, control 40 percent of Canadian mining; by contrast, foreigners control just 5 percent of mining in the United States. When the National Energy Plan was launched, foreigners controlled 65 percent of Canada's oil and gas industry as against 18 percent in the United States."

For just as many years traders, economists and investors have ignored the Fed's advice by treating each weekly money supply announcement as a major event.    The credit markets' focus on money supply data was especially evident in August when the Friday afternoon announcements were the catalyst for several major price changes.   Last Friday, for example, Treasury bond prices rose about 1 3/8 points after the Fed reported a $1.4 billion decline in the basic money supply instead of the increase of $500 million to $1 billion that had been widely forecast. On Aug. 26 bond prices fell almost a point following a less-than-expected $200 million decline in M-1, and on Aug. 19 bond prices rose almost 2 points after a suprising $500 million decline in M-1."

This message was conveyed to Poland's charge d'affaires, Zdzislaw Ludwiczak, by Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, last week, in the most substantive meeting between the two sides in many months. The report did not originate with the Administration, but was confirmed by Administration officials today.   Hoping to lend encouragement to Polish authorities to carry out some liberalizing steps in coming weeks, the Reagan Administration told the Poles that if substantial numbers of political prisoners were released, the United States would agree to join with other Western nations, members of the so-called Paris Club, on July 29 to consider rescheduling Poland's outstanding debt to Western nations, thereby allowing Poland to be eligible again for Western loans."

Although the networks obtain the license to air the shows twice, the production companies own them and control their use afterward.  But the F.C.C.'s so-called ''compromise'' position would give the networks the right to obtain 100 percent financial ownership and total creative control of the programs produced by independent companies. That means that once a network obtains the right to air an independently produced program, it also may obtain - without any further payment to the producer - the right to syndicate it, or sell it in the form of reruns."

A tiny machine screw for the Minuteman 2 missile can cost $36.77. A ring seal used in the engine of B-52 bombers can cost $2,020.50. And the Navy paid $435 for an ordinary hammer.    Selling spare parts to the military is a $13 billion-a-year business that Pentagon officials and defense-industry executives say is almost impossible to control. Perhaps more than in any other area of military purchasing, spare parts tend to be sold at huge markups under contracts that are signed without competitive bidding by manufacturers who are rewarded even if they deliver their products late.   But because the Defense Department buys them in small quantities and because they typically account for only a small fraction of a contractor's total sales, spare parts are rarely subject to close scrutiny. Officials say this means that rapid price increases are rarely challenged."

Surely, the press and much of the academic community speculated, he would turn to Martin S. Feldstein, the 40-year-old Harvard professor who was president of the respected National Bureau of Economic Research. Mr. Feldstein was the best known of the younger generation of conservative economists that had emerged in the wake of the Democrats' failure to stem inflation or generate steady growth.   Mr. Feldstein says he had heard the rumors, but had not been approached. ''I didn't want to come,'' he recounts now. Taking the initiative, he wrote the White House asking not to be considered. But when Murray L. Weidenbaum, the man who did take the job,decided to return home to St. Louis in the summer of 1982, the White House called and Mr. Feldstein was ready - even eager."

But in the months since he became head of the newly formed leisure- time group of Gulf and Western Industries, Paramount's parent, he has been studying the lexicons of computers, publishing and sports - and of divestiture."

The spokesman, Benjamin Welles, also told reporters that the United States had protested to the Soviet Union that Soviet warships had harassed American ships in those waters and thus hampered the search for the flight recorders.   At the same time, the State Department spokesman, John Hughes, said the Soviet Union had promised to turn over ''objects and documents'' recovered from the airliner, which was shot down by a Soviet jet fighter on Sept. 1 with the loss of 269 lives."

The name of each of these two black women is inevitably mentioned in the same breath as that of a key political leader. Each of them has had to bear an almost unbearable loss. Each has been recognized as a significant political figure in her own right, not only by blacks but also by the white authorities who reserved a singular form of restriction for them, one that has left them with surprisingly similar perspectives on black politics.   That restriction was not only to silence them with what are called banning orders but also to banish them to obscure and impoverished rural communities, where they knew no one and where they would be isolated from the political milieus in which they had been effective."

The commentary by Tass, the official press agency, said that the new tape transcript proved that as far as American efforts to lay the blame for the incident on the Soviet Union were concerned, ''All this hullabaloo, from beginning to end, is built on lies, on a crude, brazen distortion of facts.''   The commentary followed the release by the State Department on Sunday of a revised transcript that made three changes in the initial transcript of the Soviet conversations. The revised transcript included a new reference by one of the Soviet pilots to firing ''cannon bursts'' six minutes before he launched the missiles that shot the airliner down."

Shultz said today that ''any notion'' that the pullback of Israeli forces in Lebanon ''is part of an effort to stay in Lebanon is totally wrong.''   Mr. Shultz, speaking to reporters outside the White House after Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense Minister Moshe Arens met with President Reagan, described the planned redeployment of Israeli forces to more secure positions in southern Lebanon as ''a step in the direction of total withdrawal.''   Mr. Shultz's comments, and those of other senior Administration officials, indicated that the United States accepts the Israeli pullback as inevitable and is abandoning its efforts to persuade Israel to reconsider or postpone the move.   President Reagan's new envoy to the Middle East, the White House deputy national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane, is to travel to the region this weekend to begin a new round of talks with Middle East leaders. Administration officials said Mr. McFarlane would probably stop in Syria as he continues the American effort to find a formula for the total withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon."

The Agriculture Department's Crop Reporting Board attributed the large size of the crop to an unprecedented yield on the acreage that was planted.

Outside of Danish fishermen, seal hunters and priests, no one was allowed into Greenland and the indigenous people were not allowed to travel beyond their Arctic land.   Thirty years ago, when it was apparent that appalling health conditions were quickly killing off the Greenlanders, the law was changed and the vast tract of frozen land was incorporated into the kingdom of Denmark.   The opening of Greenland has brought radical changes for its people, and those who have undergone the most jolting cultural shock of all have been those who have traveled 2,500 miles to settle in the mother country."

Almost since the bankruptcy code was enacted, the consumer credit industry has been arguing that it made personal bankruptcy too attractive and encouraged abuse of the bankruptcy process by people who had the means to pay their debts.   Blaming overly liberal bankruptcy laws at least in part for the dramatic rise in personal bankruptcies over the last few years, the creditors have mounted a strong legislative push to tighten the law.   In particular, they say, too many debtors are filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 - which provides for the liquidation of assets and discharge of debt - when they are financially solid enough to manage Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which involves a stretched-out repayment plan."

They noted that the Syrian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Farouk al-Share, had said that Syria would defend its position and continue its help to Lebanese national forces, meaning units arrayed against the Government of President Amin Gemayel.   His statement, the sources said, is not to be taken lightly.

Two of these factors, they said, are positive: the sending of 2,000 marines to a position off Beirut this week, where they can support the 1,200-man force already ashore, and the visible improvement last week, at least in street fighting abilities against Moslem militiamen, of the Lebanese Army.   The negative factor, the officers said, is the withdrawal of the Israeli Army, the most experienced force in Lebanon, to new positions that they said would open the way for what one officer called ''seepage'' by Moslem militia forces into the vacated areas.   The intelligence officers noted that Israeli guns would still command the army's old positions after the Israeli forces completed their pullback from the Beirut area south to the Awali River on Sunday. But they said the possibility that the Moslem militiamen would be able to infiltrate at night into the area southeast of Beirut's international airport, which is held by the marines, was a matter of concern."

Although Russians reacted with incredulity and dismay on hearing that a civilian jetliner had been downed, the measured doses of official explanation - branding the plane a hostile intruder, attributing its fate to American anti- Soviet aggression and mentioning challenges to Soviet sovereignty and prestige - have played to some of the strongest instincts nurtured by the Soviet state. In a land where foreigners are viewed with deep distrust, where state frontiers are regarded as the front lines in an ideological death struggle and where secretiveness pervades all levels of life, the notion that any plane straying into Soviet airspace is probably hostile would be common.   The Soviet explanations steered the public away from the United States report that a Soviet pilot had shot down a civilian jumbo jetliner carrying 269 people - facts that have yet to be explicitly acknowledged by Moscow - and to the familiar patterns of Soviet- American rivalry."

Alarm has been growing here since last month, when rebels led by former President Goukouni Oueddei and backed by Libya wrested control of Largeau, a northern garrison town, from troops of President Hissen Habre and pressed southeastward toward the oasis of Oum Chalouba.   Chad's Information Minister, Mahamat Soumalia, said today that Government troops were still resisting in the Oum Chalouba area but would probably have to withdraw again, this time to what he described as a strong line of defense at Biltine, about 100 miles farther south."

''I was pushing very, very strongly for us to resign the business,'' said the 46-year-old one-time art director, who became chairman of D.D.B./U.S. a month later.   Until it terminated with Doyle Dane, Procter & Gamble in all of its years had never completely left an economically healthy agency or one that planned to continue operating. D.D.B. had been one of its agencies for a decade. Of Procter & Gamble's estimated $671.8 million in billings in 1981, Doyle Dane had $20 million."

Peterson, Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon Administration, who resigned 10 years to the day of coming to Lehman.   Not surprisingly, Mr. Glucksman's dramatic ascendancy to this top spot after a Lehman board meeting last week has been a topic of Wall Street speculation. In public statements issued by the two men, it was clear that Mr. Glucksman, who had for years been the No. 2 executive at Lehman, wanted to run the firm alone. While both he and Mr. Peterson said that the latter's departure was voluntary - Mr.  Peterson will leave to go into venture capital - the transition could not have taken place without Mr. Glucksman having been fully confident of the support of key Lehman partners as he pursued his ambitions."

In addition, he said the United States remained committed to insuring that any final settlement in Lebanon provides ''appropriate security arrangements'' along Israel's northern borders.

The intruder plane had deviated from the existing international route in the direction of the Soviet Union's territory by up to 500 kilometers and spent more than two hours over the Kamchatka Peninsula, the area of the Sea of Okhotsk and the island of Sakhalin.   In violation of international regulations the plane flew without navigation lights, did not react to radio signals of the Soviet dispatcher services and made no attempts to establish such communications contact.   It was natural that during the time the unidentified intruder plane was in the U.S.S.R. airspace Soviet antiair defense aircraft were ordered aloft, which repeatedly tried to establish contacts with the plane using generally accepted signals and to take it to the nearest airfield in the territory of the Soviet Union. The intruder plane, however, ignored all this. Over the Sakhalin island, a Soviet aircraft fired warning shots and tracer shells along the flying route of the plane."

Later in the century, after two young men hit upon a process for producing the metal in quantity, the price plummeted to 57 cents a pound - a level that made aluminum better suited to soda cans than dinner service.   While far less dramatic than a century ago, sharp price fluctuations are still the bane of aluminum manufacturers. Now, as the industry enjoys a sharp upturn after its deepest recession in more than three decades, company executives and industry analysts say that maintaining stable, relatively high prices is crucial to sustain the industry's recovery."

Noble Proxy Rules For Activists,"  THE Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to change its shareholder-voting rules this week, which may make it harder for small shareholders and social activists to advance their causes at corporate meetings.   The commission will vote on whether to tighten or - less likely - to liberalize its rules allowing shareholders to include proposals in proxy materials. In the past, such proposals have included attempts to curtail business in South Africa, have questioned the morality of producing napalm and have pressed for bans on nuclear power.   The proposed changes reflect concern among some agency officials that activists and corporate gadflies have used existing rules to turn annual meetings and proxy votes into public spectacles.

Mr. Shultz reportedly told the senators that the Soviet Union had violated an international code of conduct when it destroyed Korean Air Lines Flight 7, and that reprisals should come not merely from the United States, but also from the rest of the world.   Defying the Administration's position, a group of conservative senators, meanwhile, moved to gain Congressional support for specific diplomatic and trade sanctions, in retaliation for the Soviet destruction of the plane.   The conservatives' proposal was introduced over the objections of the Senate leadership of both parties as an amendment to a resolution condemning the Soviet action. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the measure Wednesday, and leaders have predicted it will be adopted unanimously."

The late 1970's sparked investor interest in the the exchange, too. The focus then was on the Amex's energy stocks, which helped push the exchange's index to new highs.   Today, however, the Amex has lost some of its momentum. While the index again registered strong gains in the past year's bull market, the number of listed companies has steadily slipped. The volume of stock trading has also failed to grow as rapidly as that of its two main competitors, the New York Stock Exchange, which has started a push for the growth companies traditionally attracted to the Amex, and the over-the- counter market, whose sophisticated electronic trading systems are becoming more popular."

The rebels may have acted independently when they began their revolt, but their ability to expand the area under their control and repeatedly attack Arafat loyalists in Lebanon could have been done only with Syrian approval, and, at this stage, can be stopped only by Syrian decree.   Not surprisingly, the mediation team formed by the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis today will concentrate its efforts as much on patching up the Assad-Arafat rift as on dealing with the rebels and their demands.   Not only has the P.L.O. decided to focus on the Syrian-Arafat dispute, but so too have the would-be Arab mediators. Saudi Arabia and Algeria each sent envoys to Damascus today with an offer to convene a meeting in Saudi Arabia between Syrian and Arafat representatives to talk out their differences."

In almost every state, the independents have charged the oil companies with supplying gasoline to their own company- operated stations at steep discounts. Many are now urging new laws that would create ''retail divorcement,'' or prohibit large oil companies from operating their own retail outlets."

We answered last week that they come simply from those who hire - from bosses. We also considered society's attitude toward bosses; and because bosses who succeed tend to do well financially, this includes society's attitude toward the rich.  One of the clearest signals the rich receive about society's attitude toward them comes quietly but forcefully in the tax laws. Our existing tax system is based on a progressive scale. The more money you make, the higher your percentage of tax. The individual who earns twice as much as another pays more than twice as much tax. The principal rationale for this is a platitude that is on the tongues of all politicians and many citizens: ''The rich have a greater ability to pay.''  It sounds good: Let the wealthy fund the Government, for the most part. But one of the verities of life is that for every benefit, there is a cost."

Morgan Guaranty put the rate as high as 10.5 percent on Friday.

The essence of entrepreneurial capitalism, real estate is a business with a tradition of high-rolling megalomania, of master builders striving to erect monuments to their visions.

Proponents of industrial policy, who would like the Government to develop policies to help specific industries, say yes. They contend that, without such a policy, American manufacturers cannot hold their own against foreign competitors that are aided, or propped up, by their governments.   But a recent study that is attracting attention in economic and business circles concludes that manufacturing in the United States is basically sound. The study, by Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, will be expanded upon in a book, ''Can America Compete?'' It is to be published early next year by Brookings, a research group in Washington."

But interviews with market participants have disclosed uncertainty about whether a drop in the cost of credit can be sustained, and, if rates go back up again, whether the economy will continue to expand.  Interest rate forecasts by Wall Street economists seem to be geared to the weekly gyrations of the nation's money supply - a big increase is often interpreted as implying higher rates, and a big decline the reverse.  Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan has been making speeches suggesting that interest rates would drop if only the nation's bankers were willing to credit the Administration with getting inflation under control. But this view has not attracted much of a following in either Washington or Wall Street."

If it continues, the rising demand for credit could push up interest rates and threaten recovery. Almost all of the increase came from individuals and state and local governments. Interest rates are unlikely to rise sharply, analysts say, until nonfinancial corporations start to demand substantial credit. (Page D1.)    Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said banks and other members of the financial community are maintaining a higher- than-necessary level of interest rates. In renewing a complaint voiced earlier this year, he was reflecting Administration concern that continuing high interest rates could weaken the recovery next year.

But a bad economy, tough competition on its home turf and a misreading of the video cassette market has changed all that. Today the company, armed with a host of new products and an expanded research and development budget, is fighting hard to regain its corporate confidence - and its American market share.   It will not be a battle easily won. Sony reported that profits in the first half ended April 30 plunged 66 percent from a year earlier, to $45 million. The drop was due mostly to severe price-cutting and sagging sales overseas, particularly in the United States, which accounts for more than 25 percent of Sony's total revenues. The disappointing showing followed an even steeper decline in net income in the last quarter of 1982."

But the move was also rooted in perhaps Scott's most bruising marketing battle to date, a fight, more than a decade ago, with its chief rival, the Procter & Gamble Company, and others, for a bigger share of the paper towel, toilet paper and tissue markets.  Scott is the world's largest producer of what the industry calls personal paper products. And it is still fiercely competitive with P. & G., since both hold roughly a 25 percent share of the national toilet paper and paper towel market.

To which the people at Lansdowne Advertising say, ''Thank goodness.''   The ads, featuring the somehow related, sometimes wild but totally fictitious Dior family, were created with the idea of raising sales of the products of 32 licensees of the Dior name through raising awareness by raising eyebrows.   Other big-name designers are always getting their names in gossip columns, and that is beneficial to their licensees. But Christian Dior has been dead since 1957, and this advertising is intended to make the news he can no longer make himself. It is also the first umbrella Dior advertising to benefit franchises, just like Century 21 or Burger King."

A statement this week by the Minister of National Education, Gerrit Viljoen, said he had decided not to fix quotas on the admission of nonwhites to the nine predominantly white universities because he was convinced there was ''unlikely to be a substantial change in the composition in their student bodies'' in the immediate future.   However, he indicated that the law would be held in reserve and the situation reviewed annually to keep nonwhite enrollment on these campuses from rising to a level that the Government deems unacceptable.   The Government has never said what that level is, but it appears to be determined to keep any of the predominantly white universities from becoming predominantly nonwhite. That possibility is more than theoretical in a society in which whites account for only 16 percent of the population, but it is also fairly remote."

Too little regulation may expose people to danger; too much may be costly and unnecessary. And even when moved to action, the regulator often cannot readily justify it. The benefit - usually a vague commodity, like ''safety'' - may not be universally apparent, while the cost may be more easily measured and is often sizable."

As the White House sees it, the public, Congress and the press have failed to appreciate the serious threat posed by Soviet and Cuban interference in the region.   It was no accident, Administration officials said today, that Mr.  Reagan returned several times at the news conference to the theme.  At one point, he ascribed the trouble in Central America to ''revolution exported from the Soviet Union and from Cuba and from others of their allies.'' Later he said, ''If you go to the source'' of violence in the region, ''I think you're talking about the Soviet Union.''   But many legislators continued to express confusion and dissent today over the President's stated policy.  The House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., was sharply critical of Mr. Reagan's defense of his policy at the news conference, calling the President's performance inept and ill-informed."

The initial issue of $145 million, like most ''munis,'' sold well because of its tax-free interest income and its presumed safety.   This ritual was re-enacted 13 more times, and by the spring of 1981, the Washington Public Power Supply System had sold $2.25 billion in bonds for the two plants. Major Wall Street investment houses, in the time-honored tradition of underwriting, bought the bonds and resold them at a profit, frequently to small investors who were saving for retirement and considered the paper gilt-edged.   While the bond sales were taking place, however, basic questions were being raised about the economic viability of the power plants. One warning, in fact, was sounded by the Seattle City Council before the first bond was ever sold, when it decided not to be a customer for the electricity that the two nuclear plants were to produce. The decision was based on a detailed study that said demand for electricity in the Northwest could be met through conservation and simpler power plants."

Nine pipelines now on sponsors' drawing boards to carry coal from mines to electric utility plants are unlikely to be built without the emiment domain authority contained in the bill.   That authority would let the slurry companies lay their pipelines on private property without the consent of the owners provided the companies paid fair compensation to the property owners."

But all seem to agree that the Korean flag carrier is ''extremely aggressive'' in its quest for rapid growth, its bargain-basement pricing of tickets and its willingness to assume huge debts to finance its ambitious plans.   According to some airline officials and pilots, the corporate inclination toward aggressiveness is seen in the flying practices of Korean Air Lines pilots, nearly all of whom are alumni of the South Korean Air Force.   For example, there is a practice some pilots use to land their plane before others. Since ground control radar can reach only about 200 miles, a pilot will give a false position to the control tower from outside its tracking range, indicating that the plane is closer or better positioned for landing than it is."

Thus, the companies seem to face a choice of either restricting sales of their most profitable models or paying millions of dollars in fines.   One idea under study at the Transportation Department is to permit the companies - G.M.'s situation is considered much worse than Ford's - to include high-mileage light trucks when calculating their status under the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, rules. Another idea is to allow the auto makers to borrow against future credits. There is more flexibility than generally acknowledged in administering the standards, one official insists."

A separate report said that 10 states participating in a two-month test concluded that the Administration's free-market approach to the oil problem would turn an oil shortage into an economic disaster that would send oil prices to $98 a barrel.   Assistant Energy Secretary William A. Vaughn said, however, that that test, coordinated by the International Energy Agency, showed that letting the free market determine the price of oil in a crisis would reduce consumer demand enough to curb the need for Government action on price or allocation."

From the standpoint of Soviet foreign policy, American specialists reason, shooting down an unarmed commercial plane and then saying it was on a spying mission makes little sense because it fuels confrontation with the West and undercuts the peace offensive of the Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov, especially in Western Europe.   Officials here regard the extraordinary news conference Friday of Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov, chief of the Soviet General Staff, as evidence Moscow has been stung by Western charges and is concerned it has so far come off poorly in the struggle for world opinion, but not enough to admit responsibility.   A week ago the Soviet press was implying that a Soviet fighter pilot had mistaken the Korean civilian Boeing 747 for an RC-135, an American military reconnaissance plane. But within 48 hours the Soviet line hardened and on Friday Marshal Ogarkov said the decision to shoot down the plane was ''not an accident or an error.''"

Certain obvious strengths of Japanese schools clearly could be incorporated into the American system, beginning with the priority that education receives. The Japanese spend more of their national income than Americans do on education, give it a larger share of the national budget and reward their teachers, who work year-round, with higher salaries and more social status. Teachers are seen as performing a valued service to their country."

But Lebanese and United States officials offered differing evaluations of the likelihood of any early movement toward a solution of the problem.   Foreign Minister Elie Salem of Lebanon, who is in Washington in advance of Mr. Gemayel's arrival on Wednesday, expressed optimism today that Syria's adamant refusal so far to negotiate a withdrawal was only a temporary, tactical move. No Fear of Partition   Mr. Salem also said he had no fear that either Israel or Syria had plans for any permanent partition of his country.  ''I am confident that we will break the stalemate and then we will have progress and phases that will show encouragement and then we can regain a momentum that I think we have lost in the past two months,'' Mr. Salem said."

Her family has not seen her since.   Miss Orellana, a 32-year-old lecturer in psychology, is now part of the shadowy world that so many Latin Americans have come to know as ''the disappeared.''   Her case reflects the many complicated and sometimes confusing facets of life in a society where violence always seems to be lurking just below the surface and where, in the absence of strong judicial and civic institutions, rumor and fear run free.   Miss Orellana is one of 34 people missing from the University of San Carlos, Guatemala's most distinguished center of learning.  Perhaps 10 times that number are now known to be missing from the society at large."

But this time around, the banks may come out ahead and wrest some of the corporate loan business back.   According to Jay N. Woodworth, a vice president and economist at the Bankers Trust Company, the volume of commercial paper outstanding over the last three months has declined at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 22.1 percent, while domestic corporate loans made by banks declined at a rate of only 5 percent.   He attributes the differential to a drop in the supply of money available for loans in the commercial paper market and a relative increase in funds available through banks. He cites the shift of billions of dollars from money market mutual funds, which operate outside the banking system, into high-yielding money market accounts, which banks began offering last December. Money market mutual funds have been the chief source of money for the commercial paper market."

Freidin came up with the notion that vacationers might enjoy bicycling from country inn to country inn in Vermont.   Today, the 42-year-old former professor of American history is the owner and director of Vermont Bicycle Touring, the first and largest business of its kind in the nation.   From modest beginnings in 1972, when 75 people tried out what was then a novel concept in tourism, the business has grown to the point where this year more than 5,000 vacationers will spend a total of 15,000 days on Vermont roads - and, of course, 15,000 nights in Vermont inns.   Over the years, Mr. Freidin's success has generated a host of imitators. Just in Vermont, for example, operators have arranged inn-to-inn tours by way of canoe, horseback and hiking trail, not to mention establishing several new bicycling businesses. And in the winter, hardy souls can ski cross-country from inn to inn as well."
