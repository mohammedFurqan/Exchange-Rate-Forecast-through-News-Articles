Then Angel Nuno, the secretary of Caltojar's Town Hall, got the idea of painting imitation Picassos on its white walls and low adobe buildings.   ''At first we thought of paying homage to Velazquez,'' related the energetic Mr. Nuno. ''But then we realized that it was the year of Picasso and that 'Guernica' was about to be brought to Spain.

Its civil aircraft production has not been large enough to increase profits, and its military output - Fokker makes F-16 fighters under license - is scheduled to taper off in the mid-1980's.   To complicate matters, a 12-year-old merger with Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke, a small West German aircraft company, broke up earlier this year because of conflicting German and Dutch aviation policies.   But Fokker, trying to put its house in order, has embarked on a strategy that some industry analysts consider risky. In an effort to increase output and compensate for the maturing F-16 program, the company has joined forces with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation to build a 150-seat aircraft."

At the end of their annual December meeting, the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations issued a special statement dealing with the negotiations on limiting intermediaterange nuclear forces that began 12 days ago in Geneva.  They also released a communique that stressed their support for arms-control efforts.   Both documents praised the United States and were warmly received by Secretary of State of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. because they seemed to underline allied unity in relations with the Soviet Union at a time when the alliance is undergoing strains over Libya and other issues. The emphasis on proceeding with plans for nuclear modernization, while at the same time stressing a desire for arms control, was aimed both at the Soviet Union and at groups in Europe that have called for curtailment of allied plans for new nuclear forces."

Evolving is a new sort of customer's man, one who offers a dizzying variety of financial services and products that were once primarily the purview of lawyers, accountants and tax advisers. ''The people who survive in this business are those who will be investment advisers, not stockbrokers,'' said a young Merrill Lynch account executive.   But whether this trend is an entirely benign development remains to be seen. With brokers now performing services that were once confined to banks, and exercising a potential cradle-to-grave control over family finances, the questions arise: Can the new type of broker offer the investor the same impartiality that is expected of the lawyer or tax adviser? Is the current commission structure, in which the broker has a vested interest in the investment decision, suitable? Will present safeguards be sufficient to prevent abuses of trust?"

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was awakened with the news inAustralia, where she was attending the Common wealth conference, was careful not to take a boastful stance tonight , but the collapse of the hunger strike was regarded by many as a v indication of her firm refusal to grant the prisoners the political status that they had demanded.

Stockman, the budget director, said today that if a weak economy caused Federal revenues to fall short of forecasts, he would not seek additional spending cuts just to prevent the budget deficit from growing.   If the shortfall in revenues was essentially a result of the business cycle, Mr. Stockman said, an offsetting reduction in spending would be difficult to achieve ''and it wouldn't be wise in any event.'' An aide later confirmed that Mr. Stockman meant a further slash in spending might make the economy still weaker.   Answering questions at a press breakfast, Mr. Stockman seemed to take a dim view of putting the United States monetary system back on the gold standard. ''I don't see it as a panacea or a near-term fix,'' he said. This was his most explicit public statement on gold since a Presidential commission began reviewing the question in August."

The reduction, Nigeria's second in two months, was viewed by market experts as evidence that reports that OPEC members were near a compromise on a unified base price of $34 might be premature. The reason is that the Nigerian price, because of quality and transportation surcharges of up to $5 a barrel that that country usually levies, would be too low to fit in with the accord."

The leaders, eight from industrial nations and 14 from the socalled developing world, have already agreed to make no agreements, to take no actions that govern the way the world buys, sells and finances its goods and services.   Their discussions on Thursday and Friday, however, will be more than a seminar. The 22 confront a critical political decision that ultimately could affect everything from the price of jute in Bangladesh to control of the International Monetary Fund.   The leaders will decide whether to begin far-ranging negotiations on world aid and trade under the auspices of a United Nations organization - in which Vanuatu's vote would equal Japan's and where Belize and the United States count the same - or whether these issues shall remain inside the traditional postwar institutions, the I.M.F., the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. These are institutions controlled by economic weight, thus by the rich, industrialized nations."

Many newspaper executives say the games are highly valuable in introducing people to their pages. But the increased use of the contests in recent years is questioned by some industry analysts as being of limited value since the circulation gains they bring are largely temporary.   The games are often employed by newspapers that are fighting for the same readership - such as New York's two major tabloids, The Daily News and The Post. Large Cash Prizes Offered   Though they have been losing money, the two papers are currently trying to attract new readers with much-promoted, bingo-like games that feature large cash prizes. The Post's game, Wingo, and The News's Super Zingo both made their debuts last month. Super Zingo has lately been joined by a variation, Instant Zingo. The Post this week is offering a grand prize of $100,000."

The New York company hired only male Japanese nationals for management positions, and was sued by a group of women secretarial employees on the ground that the policy violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   The company argued that it was exempt from Title VII on the basis of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Japan. This 1953 treaty, similar to other trade treaties, allows companies of one country doing business in the other country to hire ''technical experts, executive personnel and other specialists of their choice.''"

Among the clear losers seem to be Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization; Saudi Arabia; Lebanon; the United States, and the concept of Arab unity.   Israel, through no effort of its own, escaped the onus of being the obstacle to opening some form of new peace negotiations in the Middle East. Now the Israelis can point to the hard-line Arab countries and the Palestinian guerrillas as rejecting not just any peace overture, but one that originated with the Arabs themselves.  The turnabout could help to erase the memory of the bombing raids on Baghdad and Beirut last summer and restore Israel's image as a small, embattled land surrounded by implacable enemies."

The plan, these sources said, called for the F.T.C. to seek additional information from Mobil about the economic impact of its takeover. But instead of enabling Mobil to proceed 10 days after it supplied the data, as provided by law, Mobil would be permitted to go ahead immediately in exchange for assurance that the two companies would be kept separate for six months while the F.T.C studied the antitrust implications of a merger.   The F.T.C., which must act by midnight Saturday if it intends to prevent Mobil from proceeding with its takeover, will soon ask Mobil to supply the additional data, these sources said."

This activity of gas producers has resulted in what has been dubbed ''category creep,'' a recently recognized phenomenon that distributors say could raise wellhead gas prices -and therefore the prices paid by consumers - by perhaps as much as $4 billion next year.   Category creep appears to be entirely legal. It is essentially the effort of producers to get their gas classified in higher-priced categories established under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.   ''Producers are creatively finding ways to increase their prices,'' declared Benjamin Schlesinger, a vice president of the American Gas Association, which represents gas pipelines and the utilities that buy gas from producers and sell it to consumers. He mentioned such practices as drilling old wells deeper or drilling new wells to tap old fields so that the gas produced qualifies for higher prices."

Apart from a formal statement Monday by the official press agency Tass that declared events in Poland to be the ''internal affair'' of the Poles, the commentary today, also by Tass, was the closest thing to an official Soviet pronouncement since the Polish Communist leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, announced the crackdown on the independent trade union Solidarity three days ago.   Although the Reagan Administration has emphasized the need for restraint in statements on Poland so as not to provoke direct Soviet military intervention, the Tass commentary said that Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and other senior officials had set ''imperialist terms'' for the resolution of Poland's domestic problems.   ''While interfering in the domestic affairs of the sovereign Polish state,'' the commentary said, ''the United States is trying to prove that the events in Poland in some way concern U.S. security interests. But Poland is a member of the Warsaw Pact treaty organization, a member of the Socialist community of states, and the United States should not look there for any 'security zone,' as Washington is doing practically in all other parts of the globe.''"

Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, and to President Reagan to try to avert a hunger strike by Andrei D. Sakharov, the dissident physicist, which he has said he will begin Sunday to press for the emigration of his stepson's fiancee.   The messages were signed by 25 scientists, including 18 Nobel laureates, among them two winners this year for physics, Nicolaas Bloembergen of Harvard and Arthur Schawlow of Stanford.   At the same time, a number of scientists and specialists on the Soviet Union expressed concern that there was little that Americans could do to influence Moscow because of cutbacks over the last few years in academic exchanges.   The reductions are a result of earlier protests over Soviet human rights violations and the intervention in Afghanistan, as well as a decrease by the Reagan Administration in Federal financing for exchange programs."

According to Government officials and Western diplomats, the change reflects the easing of tensions a year after President Milton Obote's return to office in Uganda.   Those foreigners and Ugandans seeking encouragement in this poor, violence-prone land also point to a tentative economic revival born of measures introduced in June in consultation with the International Monetary Fund. These measures have halted gasoline smuggling and undermined the black market."

Turkish military and civilian leaders view Mr. Haig as an old friend who knows this country well, both its strengths and its limitations. It is often emphasized by Turkish officials that Mr.  Haig, as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, was strongly opposed to the American embargo on arms sales to Turkey after Turkish troops occupied northern Cyprus in 1974.   The Haig visit, following that of the Secretary of Defense, Caspar W. Weinberger, who pledged more economic and military aid to Turkey last week, is generally seen as a move by the United States to strike a new and close relationship beyond the existing good ties within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

PALNT,"  The shock waves struck early this year: The General Motors Corporation, operator of the Hyatt bearing plant here since 1938, planned to close the factory. G.M. said it would buy less costly parts elsewhere, including Japan, where wages and benefits run about half of the more than $20 an hour that workers here cost.   But leaders of the United Automobile Workers union local came back with a proposal to slash their pay by 30 percent and buy the plant.  Now, with G.M.'s eager commitment to $100 million in orders for each of the next three years, plus $20 million in funding, the factory is about to go it alone, albeit with only half its previous labor force. How the Takeover Works   The mechanism will be an Employee Stock Ownership Trust. Under such a trust, workers and managers together share ownership of a business. The workers at Hyatt, both manual and executive, have borrowed the money needed to buy Hyatt from General Motors for $60 million. Future profits will be used to repay the loan, and then the new owners will be able to build up their equity."

Weinberger and Defense Department aides, senior Administration officials disclosed today.   High officials in both the State and Defense Departments, who spoke with the understanding that they would not be named, said that for a long time Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and his aides, feeling that Mr. Weinberger's approach was unrealistic, had opposed it and advocated a more modest proposal.   The officials said that the fundamental State Department position was for a reduction in Moscow's current inventory of more than 600 SS-4, SS-5, and SS-20 missiles to ''the lowest possible level,'' with the United States being allowed to match that with an equal inventory of intermediate-range missiles.   But Mr. Weinberger was reported to have argued against this approach on grounds that it was too ''fuzzy'' and to have pushed for Mr. Reagan to put forward an offer that was ''straight and simple'' - the offer to forego the planned deployment of 572 American Pershing-2 and cruise missiles if Moscow would dismantle the force of SS-4's, SS-5's, and SS-20's it had based in the western Soviet Union."

These conclusions are presented by Dr. Ellen Jones in an article in Strategic Review, a publication of the United States Strategic Institute, a nongovernmental organization. Dr. Jones, now an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency in the past.   She says those who argue that Soviet military strength will be affected by manpower shortages overlook the ability of the Defense Ministry to maintain the yearly intake of conscripts at close to the current level.   Her conclusions are supported by intelligence analysts at Atlantic alliance headquarters in Belgium, where the comparative reductions in the manpower reservoirs of the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been closely studied. The studies predict that the United States, Britain and West Germany will encounter manpower problems in the rest of this decade."

The declaration of martial law over the weekend and the ban on trade union activity, many Western bankers said, was inevitable so long as the country's economy continued to plunge, leaving factories partly idle and the population with inadequate food and fuel supplies.

Domestic producers are modernizing many of their facilities, but apparently they have finally accepted with resignation their diminishing importance in the world steel industry.   The steel sector has shown its faith in the Reagan Administration's more attractive tax, environmental and regulatory policies by announcing a series of investment projects valued at more than $5.8 billion, a substantial sum by any measure. But with its bold, $6.4 billion bid last week for the Marathon Oil Company, the United States Steel Corporation vividly illustrated the sector's ambivalence toward its basic business."

By late in the day, short-term interest rates were slightly higher, while note and bond yields were about unchanged. Dealers said that the heavy supply of new corporate notes and bonds had been well received, but that the continuing influx of new issues was putting some pressure on the market.   ''Some investors see more issues coming, and have decided to back away from the market,'' one investment banker said.  Many economists have been scrutinizing Federal Reserve actions for signs that the Fed will encourage the often-predicted rate decline by pumping more credit into the banking system. Yesterday the Fed added credit for four and eight days, via temporary purchases of securities, and then permanently added reserves though purchases of agency securities for Monday delivery."

Because the terms of most new issues are negotiated between the company and the underwriters, it is possible for a new debt issue to wait in the wings and not be announced until the underwriting group has lined up buyers for most or all of the securities. This can happen rapidly, as shown last Friday when Caterpillar Tractor's Aarated notes due in 1988 were offered to yield 14.75 percent and Nova Scotia's A-1 notes due in 1991 were offered to yield 15.75 percent."

Last month, the unemployment rate was at 8.4 percent of the work force.   Elsewhere in the industrialized world, unemployment is also expected to rise because economic growth will be too low to accommodate those entering the labor force for the first time as well as those laid off because of improvements in production efficiency."

Companies, anticipating ever-rising sales, had crammed their warehouses with materials and supplies and products, only to watch them languish there when the economy stopped buying.  Those that couldn't cope shut down or sold out.   This is the interest-rate recession.

Communist Party officials here do not express concern over Hungary's catching the freedom fever from Poland but rather see the situation there as a ''failure'' for both the Communist Party leadership and the defiant labor unions.   The main fear among Communists here is that a deterioration of the security situation in Poland could lead to military intervention by the Soviet Union and its allies. This would undoubtedly block general East-West relations and close Hungary's doors to the West.  And half of Budapest's trade is with the West.

It could also lead to sharply higher tariffs on imported s-el, reducing shipments here and thereby causing layoffs abroad in a sector already hit by overcapacity and high unemployment.   Although Mr. Baldrige insisted the United States would be acting only against ''unfair'' practices, the consequences could include retaliation against American exports of food, machinery and other products by foreign governments angered by the reduction in their American steel markets."

Mr. Magid, an analyst who follows RCA for L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, means that parts of the empire would be more valuable if sold than if the ailing conglomerate continues to operate them.   Mr. Magid would like RCA to sell CIT and Hertz, redeploy the assets, retire some debt and thus become a much stronger company.  He said that RCA's chairman, Thornton F. Bradshaw, had been hinting in the press that the two divisions were for sale, although he had not been talking to analysts.   Meanwhile, Mr. Bradshaw, the former president of Atlantic Richfield, is attempting to turn RCA around, a big job.  Interest-rate-sensitive CIT and Hertz are both off stride, although CIT profits in the first nine months helped keep RCA in the black.  But the sale of the two divisions could be highly rewarding."

The trip, initiated by the Anti-Defamation League with the full endorsement of the Government - Prime Minister Menachem Begin has agreed to meet with Mr. Smith - is the latest and most vivid example of a growing effort by Israel to seek out supporters in unexpected segments of American society. The effort has been intensified as relations with the American Government have deteriorated, as customary liberal support in the United States has fallen away and as the conservative organization Moral Majority has become a political force.   Israel is now giving special attention to cultivating evangelical Christians, many of whom defend the Israeli nation for biblical reasons. Prime Minister Begin has formed a friendly relationship with the Rev. Jerry Falwell, head of Moral Majority. But the tactic has deeply distressed some American Jewish supporters of Israel, who regard the fundamentalist movement as antidemocratic and potentially anti-Semitic."

''I'm very optimistic that today's storm clouds will pass,'' Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. said when asked about Mr.  Begin's declaration today that the three-week old agreement was now canceled in his eyes as a result of the American decision to suspend further talks on carrying it out.   It was unclear in Washington tonight whether in fact the strategic cooperation accord was legally nullified or not. In his statement, Mr. Begin said that he regarded the American action on the accord ''as its cancellation.''

In a report from Washington, Tass contended that Mr. Reagan knew it was futile to adopt ''new acts of blackmail and pressure'' against the Kremlin in an effort to get the Russians to roll back the actions of the Polish military authorities.   The press agency said that the United States Administration was in a ''blind fury'' at the failure of ''counterrevolutionary scum'' in Poland and that Washington's real purpose in ordering the sanctions was to make a final attack on the roots of detente. 'A Campaign of Hatred'   Faced with the collapse of an American plot to restore ''capitalism'' in Poland, Tass said, ''Washington's rulers are in a hurry to whip up to the limit a campaign of hatred in respect of socialist countries, above all the U.S.S.R.''   The press agency said the Reagan Administration wanted ''to undermine the foundations of Soviet-American relations worked out as a result of huge efforts, and to curtail them to a minimum.'' But Tass said the President's ''crude diktat'' to the Kremlin would fail."

The interludes were filled with music. More cars were on the streets than is usual for a Sunday, particularly in a period of acute gasoline shortage. All telephones had stopped functioning, presumably to keep those who might wish to resist from coordinating actions. Page A17.

So great was their respect for his kingdom that they apologized to a tree before chopping it down.   According to legend, when Burkhan's daughter Angara eloped to marry Yenisei, the furious god threw a huge rock that stands to this day at the outlet of the Angara River, which flows from Lake Baikal to the Yenisei River.   The stories were recounted recently by Valentina I. Galkina, with little to suggest that the ancient legends had lost their power. Mrs. Galkina and her husband have spent their lifetimes studying and protecting Burkhan's world at the Limnological Institute here near the point where the Angara leaves Lake Baikal."

Another Senator, an opponent, switched to Mr. Reagan's side.   The day's developments raised the strong possibility that the President might win when the Senate votes on the $8.5 billion sale tomorrow at 5 P.M.   The Senators will vote on a resolution of disapproval aimed at preventing the President from carrying out the sale of five Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft, air-to-air fighter plane missiles and other equipment. The House has previously passed such a resolution. 'Changed My Mind,' Jepsen Says   One of the most surprising developments of the day, especially to his former comrades in the group opposing the sale, was the announcement by Senator Roger W. Jepsen, Republican of Iowa, that, after months in the role of a leader of the anti-sale group, he would now vote to support the President."

The Basses themselves are unknown even to most Texans, although they are probably among the five or 10 wealthiest families in the United States.   Several prominent Texas businessmen interviewed said that they doubted that the Basses were as big as the Hunts of Dallas. But both are so big - with each clan's total worth easily more than $1 billion - that neither family really knows how wealthy it is. But a former executive with Morgan Stanley, the investment banking firm, offered one indication of the Basses' wealth: ''We looked at their operations a while back,'' he said, ''and they were so well-heeled it was hard to find anything we could do for them.''   ''They are very, very quiet, and very, very powerful,'' added the former Morgan officer, who asked not to be identified.  The extremely private clan, which shuns the press and refuses all interviews, came to national attention last month, when it was disclosed that the family was the second-largest shareholder of Marathon Oil with 5.1 percent of the stock, after another Texas investor, Sedco Inc., which has 7.7 percent."

At a time when most long-term interest rates have increased sharply, New Jersey had the misfortune to be the third issuer of high-grade state bonds in a week. The supply of triple-A state bonds helped push yields higher just as the upcoming supply of Treasury notes and bonds has led to higher yields in that market.

Both have now had a piece of the first big postwar harvest, which has made this the only black-ruled country in Africa that has to worry about overproduction of food. Yet, although they are separated by only 25 miles and a range of hills, the two farmers - Nichodamas Manomano and Hermanus Conradie Jr. - exist in different worlds. One of these worlds knows bumper crops as a matter of course; the other still shares in the crisis of rural Africa, where population pressure and ruinous cultivation practices are part of a cycle that ends in malnutrition and the depletion of the soil itself.   Although Zimbabwe may rank as black Africa's major example of a country with a food surplus, it is too soon to say that it has found a way to unlock the productive potential of Africa's farmers. Of the 76 million bushels of corn that will eventually find its way to market from Zimbabwe's farms this year, 67 million were grown by only 4,000 white commercial farmers."

The self-criticism by the writer, Bai Hua, which evoked the kind of servility demanded of intellectuals under Mao Zedong, first appeared on Dec. 23 in The Liberation Army Daily, the military newspaper that launched the attack against him last spring.   The newspaper assailed him because Mr. Bai was serving in a cultural unit of the People's Liberation Army based in Wuhan. The military newspaper is not available to foreigners, but Mr. Bai's apology was published in full on Dec. 24 in the party newspaper, The People's Daily, which once implicitly defended him."

It was the latest reversal for a publishing company that once seemed to do most things right. A European edition, printed in Frankfurt and still undergoing editorial metamorphosis after nearly three years, is struggling to pay its way. And the newspaper itself, still more widely read in British corporate circles than any competitor, has slipped into the red for the first time since 1945.   Last year, the Financial Times Group posted a loss of $320,000 before taxes and interest income. With aggressive belt-tightening, the group might move back into the black this year, but the results are not expected to approach the $5.5 million earned in 1979 before taxes, a level more typical of the company's performance."

PARKS INC. was one of those companies whose renown stretched far beyond its relatively small size. Its more-Parks-sausages commercials were one reason. Another was its uncommon place among American corporations. It was black-owned and black-run, one of the biggest such companies in the country. Parks, however, became one of the thousands of companies in recent years that were devoured by conglomerates; and its conglomerate owner in turn was devoured by another conglomerate. And in 1980 for the first time, Parks lost money.   Today, Parks, a manufacturer many meat products besides sausage, is back on its own. It is being run by managers who were there when the company was taken over and were there to retrieve it when the conglomerates had had enough. And once again, a year since its liberation, sales are rising and Parks is making money. Raymond V.  Haysbert Sr., chief executive, and other Parks associates purchased the business from a division of Canadian Pacific that had acquired the Norin Corporation, the conglomerate that had initially acquired Parks.   From its beginning in 1951, when the founder, Henry G. Parks Jr., had but two helpers, the company grew until, with sales of $13.6 million in 1976, it stood seventh among the top 100 black-owned businesses as compiled by Black Enterprise magazine."

In the absence of an increase in Mobil's $5.1 billion takeover proposal, Marathon shares slid in value on the New York Stock Exchange.   Mobil is seeking at least 50 percent, or 30 million shares, of Marathon's 60 million shares outstanding, at $85 a share. It said, however, that only 23 million shares had been tendered since its takeover proposal was announced on Oct. 30. Most of the stock was thought to have been tendered before the United States Steel Corporation entered the bidding last Thursday with an offer for Marathon currently valued at an average price of $103 a share."

''At Dawn We Slept,'' by the historian Gordon W. Prange, to be published posthumously later this month by McGraw-Hill, argues that neither the evidence nor common sense justifies any other conclusion than the one reached in nine official investigations between Dec. 11, 1941, and July 15, 1946. That conclusion is that the Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not know in advance about the attack, which left more than 2,300 Americans dead and many warships and planes destroyed or damaged.   But two other books due to appear soon argue the opposite.  John Toland, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971 for ''The Rising Sun,'' a book about the war in the Pacific, asserts in ''Infamy,'' which Doubleday is to publish in March, that well before the Japanese attack, Washington knew that Japanese carriers were heading for Pearl Harbor. This is a shift from Mr. Toland's view in ''The Rising Sun,'' in which he expressed doubt that Roosevelt knew that the Japanese were coming."

The American economy has been on a roller coaster. This is the second recession in two years, and if interest rates go shooting up again when the current slump ends, there could be a third recession close behind.   Although it has been partly obscured by the fog of technical concepts and jargon, a conflict exists between the Administration and the Federal Reserve Board over how monetary policy should be conducted. Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Fed, regards bringing down the rate of inflation as his top priority, and has been telling both the Administration and the public that he does not intend to relax restrictive monetary policy. He told a group of real estate brokers in Florida earlier this week that ''we can't effectively deal with your problems by pumping up the money supply.'' Even if this were to produce short-term relief, he said, it would only aggravate problems for the longer run."

The Law Lords, who are roughly comparable to the United States Supreme Court, ruled that the council had acted improperly two months ago when it cut the fares by an average of 25 percent, making up the deficit by sharp increases in real estate taxes, or rates as they are known here.   Ken Livingstone, the left-wing Socialist who is the leader of the council, called the ruling ''devastating,'' and predicted that some fares might now have to be increased by 100 percent or more. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher welcomed the ruling, saying that the council's fare cut had been ''in breach of their duty to ratepayers, and wrong in law.''"

These days, mankind has learned to combat the insects that decimated the early explorers, but the chemicals used are threatening the wildlife that proliferated here in the 19th century.   Ecologists draw a parallel between the decline in the bald eagle before DDT was banned in the United States in 1972 and similar perils facing the majestic fish eagle as a result of the pesticide being used for crop-spraying and insect control in the Zambezi basin area.   Here, on the Zimbabwe-Zambia border, the Zambezi swirls below an iron girder bridge that marks the frontier. Crocodiles and hippopotamuses abound in its waters, and fish eagles, two and a half feet long with six-foot wing spans, issue haunting mocking calls from treetop aeries."

Mr. Catto told reporters at a briefing this morning, ''I don't think it has been enhanced as a result of recent events.'' His remarks were prompted by questions about a statement by Secretary of State Alexander M.

The accepted bids ranged from a high of $9.41 an ounce to a low of $9.331 and were well below silver prices in the New York cash and futures markets.   Bids were submitted for nearly five times the amount of silver announced for sale.  Another shock to the trade came when only two of the 29 bidders were awarded silver. Many of the disappointed dealers had contracted to deliver the metal to their customers and, as is customary in such cases, had hedged their sales by selling silver futures short on New York's Commodity Exchange and smaller metals markets."

Last month, LTV's staff counsel, Emmett Smith, had said that LTV would consider its bid for Grumman ''doomed'' if the Appeals Court ruling favored Grumman.   An LTV spokesman said late yesterday that the company was ''disappointed'' with the ruling but that a final decision on whether to continue with the takeover would not be made until Monday.   Grumman officials and employees were elated by the A - eals Court ruling. ''It's fantastic,'' said John C. Bierwirth, the company's chairman. ''It's like you've been holding your breath for a month and a half and you can finally breathe again. Everybody has a personal feeling of relief and victory.''"

The surprise involved Mr. Kvitsinsky's comparative youth -he is 45 years old - and his apparent status outside the highest levels of the Soviet hierarchy. The insight that immediately followed was this: Moscow had picked a German expert, a man who would be able to address West German public opinion throughout the talks with skill and nuance, and bring an understanding of West German strategic thinking - a factor of capital importance in the discussion of middle-range missiles - to the negotiating table and the corridors beyond.   Mr. Kvitsinsky had worked, until his appointment here, as minister counselor, or second man, in the Soviet Embassy in Bonn. Before that he had been an important behind-the-scenes figure in constructing the four-power agreement on Berlin more than a decade ago.

''There now, that's just about perfect,'' said Mr. Shroeder, a supervisor for Phillips Mushroom Farms, which is one of the major enterprises in one of the largest commercial and agricultural activities in this area of southeastern Pennsylvania.   But that good plant and millions like it notwithstanding, there is trouble here in mushroom country, and the gloom among growers is as thick as the humid air in the windowless, concrete-block houses where the crop is grown.   ''We could just have to dump them,'' said Donald Needham, a local mushroom farmer, complaining of falling prices. ''It's extremely hard to stay in business the way things are,'' said James Yeatman, one of the area's largest producers."

The diplomat, who has traveled widely in the two years that he has served here, said that Western governments had steadfastly underreported the numbers of Soviet soldiers. Last spring, an American diplomat in Kabul reported a sudden jump in the size of the Soviet forces to about 110,000, but this was quickly denied by the United States Defense Department.   Although the exact number of Soviet soldiers in this country is a matter of debate, diplomats generally agree that the Russians have not been able to curb the widespread insurgency despite a costly commitment. The diplomats say Soviet losses have been significant and painful."

The Court, without explanation, lifted a stay it had granted three months ago to the Mobil Oil Corporation, which owes other refiners some $50 million under the entitlements program and has sued the Department of Energy on the ground that the program has been mismanaged. Stay Was Granted Sept. 3   The Supreme Court stay, granted to Mobil on Sept. 3 by Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr., had blocked the Energy Department from making the final calculations necessary to close its books on oil price controls."

Although the centers of strikes are dying out, former Solidarity activists or activists of other opposition groups continue to come to light at work enterprises trying to persuade people not to observe the instructions and laws from the decree on martial law. They often exploit people's ignorance, the lack of a general knowledge of the prohibitions or injunctions in force under martial law.   Yesterday, for instance, irresponsible groups once again attempted to organize a strike in (word indistinct). Such action causes unease among the work force and the atmosphere becomes very tense. In the present situation such action is very irresponsible. Calm reigns on the streets of Szczecin and of the towns of the province. In general the instruction forbidding people to be in public places during the hours between 2 A.M. and 6 A.M. is being observed."

Secretary Haig, a number of reports tell us that the Soviet Union has supplied technical assistance, advice, some supplies, all kinds of help and encouragement in the martial law imposed inside Poland. Are they not in a sense involved, are they not an involved party in the martial law in Poland?   A. I think as the President said in his statement this week, there's no question about Soviet cooperation and support for the activities going on in Poland today.   And just as the Polish authorities must be held be responsible for the excesses of the situation, so too must the Soviet Union.  Q. Does that mean, Mr. Secretary, that if there are any sanctions imposed against Poland, they should similarly be imposed against the country that is supporting it and pressing it on - the Soviet Union?"

The layoff of nearly 1,100 workers was the latest step in what has so far been an unsuccessful attempt to bring the Exxon Corporation's ailing office automation business into the black.

Thus U.S. Steel's $6.3 billion offer for Marathon Oil is a striking departure, and there could be others like it. And with oil prices expected to fall in real terms next year, some analysts say oil company assets and stock prices are likely to continue falling, setting the stage for more takeovers.   Although a 40 percent decline in the value of oil company shares since last November suggests that the markets have already discounted falling oil prices, further declines next year are likely to hit smaller oil companies particularly hard, experts say."

I guess I think that some of the people in Europe who are opposed to some of our policies are afraid that they may wind up as kind of proxy victims in a war between us and the Soviet Union which - a fear that may be a little more, seem a little more plausible because of all the conversation about integrated battlefields and limited use of nucler weapons. And I wonder - we must think about this - do you believe that there could be a limited exchange of nuclear weapons between us and the Soviet Union or that it would simply escalate inevitably?   A. I don't honestly know. I think, again, until someplace - all over the world this is being, research going on, to try and find the defensive weapon. There never has been a weapon that someone hasn't come up with a defense. But it could - and the only defense is, well, you shoot yours and we'll shoot ours. And if you still had that kind of a stalemate, I could see where you could have the exchange of tactical weapons against troops in the field without it bringing either one of the major powers to pushing the button."

Senior Administration officials involved in the policy-making of the last two weeks assert that the United States had no choice but to take the gamble. To do nothing, or to wait indefinitely for a concerted allied response, they say, would be morally repugnant and would show the West to be impotent.   They assert, moreover, that there is still a possibility, however slim, that if the alliance does demonstrate it is truly angered by the crackdown in Poland, the authorities in Poland and in the Soviet Union might be persuaded to ease up on the repression sooner rather than later and to return to negotiations with the Solidarity union - which Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, contends is his goal."

The report appeared to be another sign of recession in a year of sluggish sales. ''It certainly indicates a weakness in the manufacturing sector,'' said Ago Ambre, a Commerce Department economist."

It has been the drink of preference for centuries in Japan and it is an indispensable ingredient in the ritual and ceremonial life of this country. No Shinto or Buddhist wedding can be sealed without the betrothed exchanging and downing three nuptial cups of sake. And to any Westerner, no matter how naive concerning Japanese ways, sake is a symbol of Japan."

In its successful campaign to defeat the LTV Corporation's $450 million tender offer, Grumman spent more than $1.5 million in legal fees and $600,000 on newspaper advertising. The bills from its financial advisers are also expected to be steep.   But Grumman's out-of-pocket expenses do not reflect the full price of rebuffing LTV. After buying Grumman stock to keep it out of LTV's hands, Grumman and its allies have had to swallow some $25 million in paper losses. And, in a long-range sense, the battle with LTV has ended Grumman's aura of isolation on Long Island, where the aircraft manufacturer is by far the largest employer."

For the purpose of the exercise, the settlement represented a fortified Israeli village on the occupied West Bank.  The emergence of the P.L.O. as a conventional fighting force, armed by Libya and trained by Syria, is one reason why senior military officials in Israel are concerned over the duration of Israel's present military domination in the Middle East. Other reasons are the steady erosion of Israel's advantage in modern weapons and the stockpiling of Soviet arms in the region."

WARSAW - Behind the workers' revolt that began with strikes in the summer of 1980 and grew to a revolution on the shoulders of the Solidarity union, the operation of which was suspended when martial law was declared, lies a story of failure. It is the failure of Communism, in the eyes of the workers, to deliver on its promise of a better life.   The revolt sprang from an unspoken consensus among Poles that despite more than three decades of sacrifice and toil, conditions of everyday life were scarcely improving and that the Communist system had failed most dramatically in precisely those areas, in the realm of social welfare, where its ideology called for greater exertion and improvement.   Appalling dirt and safety conditions in factories, cramped and unavailiable appartments, substandard and sloppy health care, lines in front of meat shops - food shortages in general despite a stringent rationing system - these were the distingushing traits of what the Government referred to as ''people's Poland.'' They were glossed over, ignored or denied by successive governments that pressed instead for higher production statistics in heavy industry."

Authors, including the novelist John Hersey and Jimmy Carter, working on an autobiography, have abandoned their typewriters in favor of them. Instead of employing secretaries to retype drafts, complete footnotes and number pages, authors are accomplishing these chores by touching a few keys.   Where there was one word processor for every 10 clerical workers last year, by mid-decade the figure will be one for every three.  However, the machines, experts believe, are not likely to lessen the demand for clerical workers in the 1980's. The use of the processors by small as well as large employers is expected to give secretaries more time and opportunity to perform duties now completed by managers. If this happens, experts believe, the serious shortage of secretaries may subside and the gap in wages between executives and secretaries may narrow."

Even though disposable incomes are rising -a rare event during periods of economic decline - concern about unemployment lines, not visions of sugarplums, are dancing through shoppers' heads. Fearful of the consequences, retailers are sacrificing profit margins to secure sales, and are discounting heavily. As a result, Christmas sales should rise 10 percent to 12 percent from a year earlier, say Elizabeth Allison and Evan Barrington, economists at Data Resources.  Yet sharp declines in durable goods purchases should cause fourthquarter retail sales to fall to an inflation-adjusted $135 billion. Moreover, the deepening recession and increased savings incentives should lead to further real declines through the first half of 1982. While this will stymie economic recovery in the short run, the longterm benefits may outweigh the costs. The longer consumer demand remains weak, the more inflation is likely to ease. Tough Trade Talks   Like oil and water, recessions and free trade don't mix. Amid rising cries from Congress and industry to consider new trade curbs, two United States delegations will be traveling abroad this week trying to smooth out long-standing disputes with officials from the Common Market and Japan."

The statement was made by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, the country's newly elected Socialist leader, at a meeting of the alliance's defense ministers, and was repeated later at a news conference.   An American official, who spoke with the understanding that his name not be used, said Mr. Papandreou's reference to a partial suspension would probably compromise all Greek involvement in NATO's integrated military structure. Arrangement 'Unacceptable'   Greece left the alliance's military command in 1974 in the wake of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, returning in November 1980 under an agreement approved by the centrist Government that was ousted from power by Mr. Papandreou in October. The arrangement that brought Greece back into the military structure is referred to as the Rogers Agreement because it was worked out in part by Gen. Bernard Rogers, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. It was described by Mr.  Papandreou today as ''militarily and politically unacceptable.''"

Howard Pew, chairman of the Sun Oil Company and patriarch of the Pew family, whose fortune controlled the company, would call his 29-year-old greatnephew into his office. There, in a ritual that occurred every other day for about a month and lasted exactly one hour, R. Anderson Pew would be grilled about religion, his life goals and politics.   When the sessions finally ended, the young man universally known as Andy, who was working in Sun's treasurer's office, was named to the board of the Glenmede Trust Company. Glenmede, the sole trustee of the Pew Memorial Trust whose $1.16 billion in assets makes it the nation's second-largest charitable trust after the Ford Foundation, is the main repository of the assets of the Pew family, estimated to be among the 10 wealthiest families in the country.   Now at age 45, Andy Pew is chairman of the powerful committee that disperses charitable contributions for Glenmede, and is considered the head of the Pews in business and foundation matters. Like his great-uncle, he is a devout Presbyterian and a Republican, but those convictions no longer have the impact they had when J. Howard stamped his moralist imprint on the management and the spending of the Pew fortune. Andy sees himself as a ''communication link'' between Sun and the Pew family, whose more than 1,000 members are scattered around the United States."

Schwab has 210,000 customers, and its revenues total about $42 million a year. It has 38 offices across the country."

Hugh Liedtke, now chairman of the Pennzoil Company, were sitting around their offices in the west Texas oil town of Midland, wondering what to name their fledgling drilling business.   They wanted something that would attract attention, something exotic, something that began with A or Z so it would be easy to find in the phone book. Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn had just made a hit movie called ''Viva Zapata!''   So Zapata it became, and the company has been attracting attention ever since. By 1966, when both Mr. Bush and Mr. Liedtke had sold their interests, the Zapata Corporation had become one of the world's biggest offshore drilling contractors."

Braun performed major design and engineering work between 1971 and 1981 at the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons plant at Rocky Flats, Colo.

Harry Truman is my favorite among the Presidents I remember, and I made a special study of the challenges he faced and his reaction to them. It was surprising how many of the same ones I inherited in some form or another, all the way from Israel to China, and including nuclear weapons, energy, Iran and especially human rights."

Allen's affairs, which has produced the most embarrassing publicity of President Reagan's first year in office, is nearing a turning point.   Within a matter of days, Attorney General William French Smith must decide whether to appoint a special prosecutor for Mr. Allen. But Mr. Smith's decision will do little to clarify the question of why the Reagan Administration allowed the Allen affair to drag on for more than two months before acting decisively.   One possible explanation for the failure to act quickly is that White House or Justice Department officials have turned up evidence damaging to Mr. Allen that has not yet come to light.   Assuming that there is no further evidence, the reasons for the slow response appear to be found within the highest councils of the Justice Department and the White House. At the Justice Department, for example, the Allen affair was originally handled as a routine inquiry until officials there became alarmed that the department might be laying itself open to charges of a ''cover-up.'' The decision by Mr. Smith and his top aides at the Justice Department to order the F.B.I. to renew an investigation that the bureau regarded as completed in October added weeks to the timetable of the Allen affair."

''I was able to get some things in half an hour without traipsing around,'' said Mr. Jackson, the general manager of a chain of furniture stores, who ordered a television set for his parents and a tape deck for a friend. ''When I was buying those Christmas presents I was doing it at 1 A.M. one night,'' said Mr. Penn, a political pollster.   The two New Yorkers are early users of electronic shopping, or ''teleshopping,'' one of a number of new electronic services, collectively known as videotex, that are expected to become widely available during this decade."

The disclosure raised immediate questions about the application of a 61-year-old Federal statute barring ownership of oil and gas leases to citizens of countries that do not grant reciprocal rights to Americans.   Kuwait has been found not to offer these rights, the Interior Department says.  The issue has come up in relation to Kuwait Petroleum's proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of the Santa Fe International Corporation, a major oil-equipment and engineering enterprise and the owner of $10 million worth of Federal leases."

The negotiations are meant to deal with weapons classified as tactical, or theater, arms - weapons that would be used in tactical support of ground forces. The issue of exactly what kind of weapons can be so classified and thus included in the negotiations is expected by State and Defense Department officials to dominate the opening sessions of the conference.   The largest and most destructive weapons involved are the intermediate-range ballistic missiles of the two superpowers.  President Reagan offered earlier this month to forgo plans to deploy new American missiles in Western Europe if the Soviet Union would dismantle the ones it has targeted at the area. The term ''intermediate range'' has been subject to a wide variety of definitions, but is usually used to cover weapons with ranges of 1,000 to 4,000 miles. The exact definition for purposes of the negotiations will have to be determined at the conference."

The average rate for one-year Treasury bills, for example, dropped to 13.159 percent at yesterday's auction, far lower than the 13.6 percent rate for outstanding one-year bills two days earlier, and well below the 14.58 percent average at the Oct. 1 auction. Based on the auction results, financial institutions may sell one-year tax-exempt certificates with a 10.77 percent yield starting Nov. 1, down from 12.14 percent currently.   ''The refunding announcement cleared the air,'' explained Richard Davis, director of fixed-income research at the First Boston Corporation. ''Even though the Treasury issues are sizable'' he said, ''people know what to expect.'' The Treasury said it would sell $4.5 billion of three-year notes next Monday, $2.25 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday and $2 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday."

He did not see Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who had agreed to meet him but was then hospitalized after falling and breaking his thigh. Mr. Smith held discussions with President Yitzhak Navon, Yosef Burg, the Religious Affairs and Interior Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, the former Prime Minister, Moshe Arens, Ambassador-designate to the United States, and other officials.   The delegation, which included about a dozen Baptists, was sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith as an effort to improve relations between Baptists and Jews in the United States, and to build support for Israel. Atmosphere Termed Very Friendly   The atmosphere was described by participants as harmonious and extremely friendly. Mr. Smith, an outgoing and cheerful man of 42 years, set a good-natured tone in each meeting by beginning with a statement of warm support for Israel. After that, according to one Israeli who attended the sessions, officials evidently felt no need to raise the question of his remark a year ago."

The question of the desert kingdom's stability is central to the debate over whether the United States should sell the Saudis Awacs surveillance planes.

At the close of three days of impassioned and bitter discussion on how to achieve independence for Quebec, Mr. Levesque left the Parti Quebecois in complete disarray and even unsure he would remain as premier of Quebec after the 10-minute tongue-lashing he gave the convention.   Mr. Levesque was angered by the decision of the majority of delegates to move immediately on the question of independence if the party wins the next provincial election. He had urged restraint because of provincial and national economic problems."

President Reagan and Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. insist that they are solidly behind the ''Camp David process,'' the Administration's term for the talks on Palestinian autonomy and the fulfillment of terms of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.   With King Hussein of Jordan having arrived here today for talks with President Reagan, the scene has been set for a public discussion of the Administration's Middle East strategy, if indeed the Administration is ready to go beyond generalities. U.S. Response to Saudi Plan   Senior officials say they cannot understand why Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel has evidently chosen to make a major issue out of the Administration's modest words of welcome for some aspects of an eight-point list of principles for a Middle East solution that was offered in August by Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia.   Mr. Begin, appearing on the ABC News program ''Issues and Answers'' today from Jerusalem, acknowledged receipt of a letter from President Reagan in which ''he reassures me that the United States are committed to the security of Israel,'' and that the United States ''will safeguard - this is the expression - the military and technological advantages of Israel.''"

The executives, who assembled here yesterday for the annual meeting of the American Petroleum Institute, said that this meant continuation of a trend that has seen the average price of a gallon of gasoline decline by nearly 5 cents since March, to $1.34.   The predictions of price weakness come in sharp contrast to a forecast at last year's A.P.I. meeting by Dan Lundberg, a retail oil analyst, that gasoline prices might reach $2 a gallon in 1981.   Nonetheless, oilmen suggested that the good news on the price front carried several worrisome implications: Pressure on refining and marketing profit margins might intensify, development of alternative forms of energy would likely be postponed and the prices of energy company stocks could not be expected to rise."

In so ruling, Judge Milton Pollack of the United States District Court in Manhattan dismissed charges brought in 1979 by two investors, Irving L. Gartenberg and Simone C. Andre, that the adviser was making ''too much money'' by levying fees that were disproportionate to the services rendered, and therefore a violation of fiduciary duty.   William P. Rogers, senior partner of the law firm of Rogers & Wells, and Secretary of State in the Nixon Administration, called Judge Pollack's ruling ''a landmark decision.''   The decision, said Mr. Rogers, whose firm represented Merrill Lynch in the case, ''establishes the law insofar as the fee that can be charged'' by a mutual fund adviser. Until now, he added, suits challenging advisory fees were settled out of court - with the adviser usually reducing fees - thus giving no guidance to the industry."

As a result of some hard negotiations between Ottawa and the provinces, Canada is due to get its own constitution early next year, and an ambitious energy program has gotten under way after the provinces that produce the nation's oil and gas ended their opposition to it. But it appears that any political benefits the Prime Minister might have expected have been largely nullified by the same recession that is afflicting the United States economy.   Early last month, just after Mr. Trudeau won the agreement of 9 of the 10 provinces on a plan to transform the 114-year-old British North America Act into a fully Canadian constitution, a Gallup poll jolted the Liberal leadership. It showed the Liberals trailing the Progressive Conservatives by four points among decided voters, enough of a difference, the Gallup organization said, to insure a Conservative majority government if an election were held now."

These include 50 separate ministries and several trade and financial institutions such as the Bank of China.

At first glance, the Bulgarian Government, led by the 70-year-old President, Todor Zhivkov, seems like a carbon copy of the Soviet Government, echoing its ideological pronouncements, careful to follow a foreign policy neither too far ahead of nor too far behind that proclaimed in the Kremlin.   Lada and Moskvitch cars, the latter assembled here, dominate the streets of the city. The uniforms of the countless military officers walking through the downtown area look a great deal like those of their Soviet counterparts. Even the alphabet is the same; the Bulgarians, like the Russians, use the Cyrillic characters attributed to two 9th-century Bulgarian brothers, later sanctified, named Cyril and Methodius."

That's how Treasury Secretary Regan sees it, and consequently the Administration believes the fallout would be minimal from recent announcements that the Government would be far deeper in deficit than it had thought.  Private economists, who had questioned the accuracy of earlier deficit forecasts, tend to disagree.   Figures that suggest deficits could rise from a $100 billion the current fiscal year are likely to prevent interest rates from falling as far as they otherwise might in a period of economic contraction, says David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston. By publishing these figures, the Administration may have prolonged the recession, he adds."

It was the fourth increase in the last five weeks, for a net gain of $7.3 billion, and touched off a spurt in short-term interest rates and a decline in bond prices that economists termed an ''overreaction.''   Earlier this year, however, expansion of the money supply was slow, and the growth rate for the past year is only 4.7 percent, significantly below the Fed's 1981 growth target of 6 to 8 1/2 percent. The M-1B money supply measure, used by the Fed as a proxy for the amount of money the public has available for spending, is defined as currency in circulation plus all kinds of checking accounts."

The problem is exacerbated today by the overstrained debt positions of many companies, as indicated by liquidity ratios calculated by the Bank of New York.   The classic remedy for a fragile financial structure is recession.  For in a recession two things happen to improve the financial position of corporations: First, although cash flow is reduced, business outlays on capital goods and inventories shrink even more, so the ratio of cash flow to capital and inventory spending improves.    Second, the level of both short- and long-term interest rates comes down, and the yield curve becomes positive, with short rates dropping more than long rates. Corporations, with long rates at their recession lows, then move to convert their short-term obligations into long-term debts, thereby strengthening their liquidity. And investors are more willing to switch from short- to long-term securities."

Aides traveling with the Vice President on his three-nation Latin American tour said this exemption was the first to be granted since Congress passed the so-called Nonproliferation Act in 1978.   The decision came at a time when the Reagan Administration has expressed interest in easing restrictions governing United States nuclear policy toward foreign nations.   It removes a key element of discord between the United States and the increasingly independent-minded leaders of Latin America's largest country. Mr. Bush suggested that a further easing of the restriction could be worked out in the coming year."

It is the landmark Weber house, built in 1909 for the president of a brewery and after 1944, when it became the home of the Unity Club, the favored hideaway of leading Brooklyn Demo crats. It is at 101 Eighth Avenue, on the corner of President Str eet.   Nor are the Kossaks ordinary developers, although there is probably no way to categorize that breed except to say that they are all entrepreneurs. Jeffrey Kossak, 33 years old, left law practice on Wall Street two years ago in pursuit of entrepreneurial ventures, real estate and otherwise. And Steven, 31, who is watching over construction in Park Slope, is an artist. He studied painting at Yale and the Maryland Institute of Fine Arts."

Friday   (4 P.M. Friday, E.S.T.) According to a press spokesman for the General Prosecutor's Office, units of the prosecutor's office are continuing determined action to prosecute those who have committed particularly dangerous crimes while martial law is in force.   Prosecutors are also embarking on preventive action. Among other things, prosecutors, accompanied by representatives of the Polish Army, informed the work forces in certain work places of the legal regulations introduced by the provisions of martial law. This has made it possible in many cases to calm the mood of work forces and to keep production flowing without disruption.   This was, for instance, the case in the construction modules factory in Boleslawiec where, on Dec. 14, Jan Filipek, chairman of the Solidarity unit, announced a meeting of the work force and proclaimed a warning strike. After explanations from a prosecutor and an army major, the work force started work, and Jan Filipek fled.  Summary proceedings have been instituted against him."

Inco announced its bid for ESB in July 1974, and it soon became clear that this was no ordinary corporate proposal. Inco's takeover attempt, an unwelcome move, represented something new and important that shocked the business community: This was the first time a conservative blue-chip company had fired its cannon at a peaceable target."

The Administration, particularly Secretary of State Alexander M.  Haig Jr., lobbied hard over the weekend to convince House-Senate conferees that military and economic assistance programs were in danger of being undercut by inadequate funds. Economic support, as distinct from food and development aid, is made available to friendly countries that are also recipients of military aid or purchasers of American arms.   Senate Republicans were in agreement. ''The levels contained in the continuing resolution that the President vetoed would severely restrict the President's ability to carry out his foreign policy,'' said Senator Charles H. Percy, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee."

Normal communications with The Times's Warsaw bureau chief, John Darnton, have been barred by the authorities there since Dec. 14.   It is clear that the workers' resistance to martial law and to suppression of their newly won civil and union rights has been more widespread and persistent than the military authorities anticipated.   According to unofficial but knowledgeable sources, many more than 5,000 people - the figure acknowledged by the authorities - have been arrested or interned since the imposition of martial law Dec. 13.   Conditions vary, but many are being held under conditions of little food, clothing or heating in temperatures as low as 10 degrees, these sources say.

In the fiscal year 1980, Harvester sank $374.8 million into the red.  Mr. McCardell made his prediction as the company was announcing the completion of a $4.2 billion financial restructuring plan, which Harvester officials said was the largest in American corporate history.   The remarks on losses underscored the company's assertion that completion of the financing agreement -after months of negotiation - was only an inital step in pulling the company back from the brink of bankruptcy. 'Volatile Environment'   ''The environment is going to be much more volatile than in the past,'' Mr. McCardell asserted, explaining that demand for the company's heavy trucks, farm machinery and construction equipment could in the coming years be as much as 30 percent below the levels that existed in the late 1970's. Harvester said that its business plan for 1982 assumes that its markets will shrink 10 percent to 15 percent from this year's depressed levels."

In the face of a recession, there is remarkably little pressure on the Administration to change its economic policy. The reason is that, taken together, the President's huge personal tax cuts and the promised increases in military spending could turn out to be the stimulative spark the economy needs to escape the doldrums.   ''This would be a great time to have a tax cut,'' Murray L.  Weidenbaum, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said today in an interview. ''And guess what?''

It was announced as the Reagan Administration endorsed proposals to increase competition within the banking and financial services industry.   The F.D.I.C. insures deposits in nearly 15,000 commercial and mutual savings banks.

But in a business where much depends on intangibles, and where word-of-mouth can be as important as a track record, selection is not easy.   ''What a seller really is looking for is a buyer,'' says Joan Harris Spencer, who runs a real estate agency of the same name in Bronxville, N.Y. What that means is an agent who seems to offer the greatest likelihood of locating qualified buyers, and one who will not let the deal fall through because of problems in arranging financing.   Today, the best agent may be someone who can skillfully maneuver buyers and sellers through the intricacies of ''creative financing.'' ''There are at least 40 different ways of financing a sale, and if an agent can't name at least 10 right off the bat, you might want to find someone else,'' suggests Norman N. Kailo, sales manager of the Soldoveri Agency of Totowa and Wayne, N.J., and past president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors."

Although the Government statement did not identify the group by name, it was believed that those arrested belonged to Takfir Wahigra, the underground fundamentalist organization that has been blamed by the authorities for the Oct. 6 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat. The group, whose name means Atonement and Repentance, was also accused of being behind the large-scale fighting that erupted two days later in Asyut, Upper Egypt, when armed men operating in paramilitary units overran a police station and attacked other Government targets.   Today's statement linked the arrests to the Asyut fighting.

This real estate in the sky is now facing a possible ''zoning'' change.

Yet the story of how American metal bat makers were first pushed back in the Japanese market during the middle 1970's, after holding a leadership position, and then excluded altogether is becoming a cause celebre among American trade officials.   The reason is that, faced with mounting trade deficits with Japan, American and Western European officials have started all-out campaigns to try to open up what they regard as the clam-like economic system of Japan. Foreigners charge that there are many Japanese markets that can be exceedingly difficult to crack, including those for beef, citrus fruits, pharmaceuticals, financial services, communications equipment and computers.   To be sure, foreign companies trying to sell in Japan have often invested too little time and money in learning the markets, product preferences and the ways of doing business here - not to mention mastering the difficult Japanese language. But what also deters many companies from making long-term commitments in Japan is the perception that its markets are inhospitable. Accordingly, they seek more promising opportunities elsewhere. The Japanese, for their part, have long held that the notion of a closed Japanese economy is outdated."

The analyst would not identify the destinations of the armored units, but sources at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters said they believed that the tanks had been sent to the Gdansk and Warsaw regions.   The Soviet divisions appear to be playing a backup role.

Air power, military analysts in Washington and at NATO headquarters in Belgium point out, is not measured simply in terms of aircraft but is a conglomerate of bases, radar systems, fuel and ammunition depots and planes. Israel will be abandoning two of its most important air bases at Etzion and Eitam in Sinai when the withdrawal is completed.   This contraction of Israeli air resources will take place, the analysts and Israeli military sources pointed out, in a period when the Arabs forces are receiving aircraft, tanks and other weapons ordered over the last three years.

His action amounted to a first step away from the expansionary economic policies that France's Socialist Government has been following since it came to power last spring.   The aim of the new measures, Mr. Delors said, is to reduce France's annual inflation rate to 10 percent from 14 percent, thus enabling French industry to reap the full benefits of devaluation, which should swell exports and employment by making French goods cheaper in foreign markets. In yesterday's currency realignment, the West German mark and Dutch guilder were raised 5.5 percent while the French franc and Italian lira were lowered 3 percent in relation to other currencies in the European Monetary System."

It is not so much a shooting conflict as a battle involving propaganda, ancient trade routes and a surrogate army that wants the United States to support it against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader.   Geneina lies on the indistinct border between the Sudan, a pro-Western bulwark protecting Egypt's southern flank, and Chad, a country that the Soviet-supported Colonel Qaddafi all but annexed 10 months ago. Nomads Know No Boundaries   This region is known as Darfur, an area the size of France that was once a proud, independent sultanate run by a dynasty of rulers that lasted 560 years. From Geneina, caravans of pilgrims heading overland to Mecca make their way east. Men of the Tuareg stock of desert nomads roam the area, dressed in long white robes and white turbans.  With their camels and mules and trappings they recognize no international boundaries, lines that appear on the maps but not on the shifting sands and dry river beds they traverse. The town itself is one of flat-roofed houses, stretched resources and economic decay."

Foreign Minister Felleke Gedle-Giorgis summoned West European ambassadors to his office this month and, as later disclosed by one ambassador, told them that ''pressure from abroad will not change our Government's mind.''   A Swedish diplomat said the Government's rejection of the protests could result in reduced economic aid from Scandinavian nations at a time when Ethiopia is seeking more money from the West to help its ailing economy.   The diplomat said several members of Sweden's Parliament had urged such reduction. Sweden gives Ethiopia $20 million every year, and Norway gives $10 million. Sweden is the biggest donor of aid to Ethiopia and had proposed a $2 million increase next year."

The American steelmakers charge that foreign steel companies are selling here at unfairly low prices and that some of the costs of this steel are being heavily subsidized by foreign governments.

''The economic brakes will clearly be on,'' said Audrey Freedman of the Conference Board, an independent, nonprofit business research organizaation, and chairman of the panel. ''Moderation in wage demands will not spring from job competition from the growing ranks of the unemployed, but from efforts by employers to cut labor costs.  The coming year will be marked by wage freezes and reduced labor forces in many industries.''"

She switched her major from elementary education to special education, where there is a higher demand, and she resigned herself to moving out of Massachusetts because tax cuts had resulted in a freeze in the demand for teachers. She arranged her job interviews through the Massachusetts Educational Recruiting Consortium, a group of colleges that invites representatives from out-of-state school systems.  ''Every time a school system was coming to recruit, I would take the interview regardless of whether I wanted to go there,'' said Miss Stoller, who graduated this year.   She also visited the campus placement office 15 times and mailed 50 resumes. But despite a high grade-point average and extensive involvement in extracurricular activities, she wound up with only two offers. She now has a job teaching learning-disabled adolescents in Brevard County, Fla., and she considers herself lucky.   Miss Stoller's experience is one example of the ways college graduates are having to adjust to the demands of an increasingly complex and competitive job market."

TEAM VISITS POLAND,"  Washington -- Twenty-four hours before martial law descended on Poland a team from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Warsaw to begin the process of weighing the Polish application to join the 141-nation lending body.   The five fund staff members went at the invitation of the Polish Government, and had access to the Finance Ministry before leaving Warsaw at the end of last week. The aim of the mission was to collect preliminary data on hard currency reserves, trade flows, output and income per capita and other yardsticks of economic performance to establish what would be Poland's quota if the membership bid is approved.   The quota, a measure of relative financial strength, is used as the basis for making loans. Fund officials insist that it is far too early even to guess at what Poland's quota might be, but judging from numbers publicly available it could be worked at somewhere around 1 percent of the $80 billion pool of resources that the Fund represents."

Consumer advocates, equally alarmed by the prospect of success for the industry's campaign, contend that the depressed economy and the greater availability of credit, not the Federal laws, are responsible for the increase in bankruptcy cases. They also say that the industry's proposals, incorporated in a House bill last week, would essentially convert bankruptcy courts into bill-collecting agencies and would condemn some poor people to involuntary servitude.

Of every dollar of income after taxes, on average, 95 cents are spent and only about 5 cents are saved.   To Reagan Administration economists, who are trying to increase the savings rate, that low savings figure is what has held down investment and slowed the growth of productivity.   But as the Government's program to increase the personal savings rate moves into high gear on Jan. 1, when all workers become eligible to set up tax-exempt retirement accounts, many economists contend that the Government will be able to lift the rate only a small amount, if at all.   ''There is no strong reason to think that the economic program is going to increase savings sufficiently to make a difference,'' said Irwin Friend, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied American savings patterns."

There are many who disagree, but those who expect the interest rate decline to continue often cite the growing weakness of the economy as well as the Federal Reserve's money policy.   Certainly, the credit markets have been anticipating lower rates in the future, as shown by a drop in the six-month bill rate to 11.9 percent late Friday from 12.72 percent at last Monday's auction. For three-year Treasury notes, yields fell to 13.59 percent late Friday from 14.43 percent Monday, while the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 13.75 percent from 14.4 percent."

But there's only one way most folks really know how the economy is doing, and that's by watching the reports that the Government's statisticians keep cranking out, month by month, quarter by quarter.  These indicators produce more than a picture of the economy. They also form the basis for economic policy decisions and signal whether policies then in effect are working.   These major indicators, and the many others that receive less public attention, have their own pecularities and problems. Some are better than others. Some are being changed. And some could be changed, but the improvement might not make a major difference. In addition, there are complaints that the Reagan Administration's budget cuts could eventually hurt the quality of the statistics. Here is a primer on some of the economic indicators. GROWTH   The gross national product is the broadest measure of the nation's economy. The G.N.P., which is reported quarterly, can have a strong effect on government policy - because it shows whether the economy is in a recession and whether inflation is out of line."

Mr. Regan, speaking on ABC television's ''This Week with David Brinkley,'' said the nation's economic growth would decline only between 3 and 3.5 percent in the final quarter of 1981 rather than the 5 percent predicted by most private economists.   While the Treasury Secretary reiterated the Administration's view that the economy will pull out of the recession by spring, he conceded that the unemployment rate in the United States would remain near or above its current 8 percent level even after the recession ends.   ''By the fall of 1982, the economy will be coming back,'' he said.  ''It won't be humming along as fast as we might like, and unemployment will probably be in the 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent range,'' Mr. Regan said."

Despite its objection and questions raised in Congress, State Department officials said, the Administration is going ahead with the selection of a site in Florida for the new station. The station, to be called Radio Marti after the Cuban patriot Jose Marti, is being developed by a private nonprofit corporation set up in late September by the Administration to get the project started.   According to a message sent to the State Department Oct. 14 by the United States Interests Section in the Swiss Embassy in Havana, the American diplomats questioned the potential credibility of the proposed station and its cost effectiveness."

At the same time, Moscow challenged Stockholm's contention that the submarine might have been armed with nuclear weapons.  The statements, along with a renewed call for a nuclear-free zone in northern Europe, ended a public silence on the submarine incident, previously broken only by a brief press dispatch saying that the submarine, which bore the numerical designation 137, had strayed into Swedish waters because of faulty navigational equipment.   Today's statements repeated that contention. They also termed Sweden's conclusion that the submarine was probably carrying nuclear arms ''inventions evidently intended for ignoramuses.'' Tass, the Soviet Government's press agency, said the furor over the incident had been concocted by the Western press to fan anti-Soviet feelings."

Regan, the Secretary of the Treasury, said today that the Administration had dropped its proposal to raise $3 billion more in tax revenue in the 1982 fiscal year.   The $3 billion was part of President Reagan's Sept. 24 proposal - made in a nationally televised policy speech - to raise $22 billion in taxes over three years.   Secretary Regan, in an interview with news agency reporters, said the larger package was not being abandoned but, reversing earlier plans, he indicated a strong disinclination to send the specific legislative proposals to Congress before January. The import of the Secretary's remarks was that the Administration would go ahead with its announced intention of raising additional tax revenue in the years after fiscal 1982. Reasons Called Tactical   A White House official said that ''very serious consideration'' was being given to delaying the request for $3 billion of extra revenue in the 1982 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, but he added that the delay was being caused by tactical reasons and that President Reagan remained committed to the package."

President Reagan is expected to announce this decision by the end of the month.   The officials said that the principal agencies involved, the Departments of State, Defense, Treasury and Interior, have agreed that the best course for the United States is to renegotiate provisions that create an international cartel to manage the mining of nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese on the seabed.   An ''options paper'' prepared by these agencies and endorsed by the Departments of Commerce, Energy and Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency is to be sent to Mr. Reagan in a few days.

White House strategists have calculated that the outcome will have an impact not only on the President's conduct of foreign policy but also on the general perception in Washington of his influence with Congress in this second, more trying phase of his Presidency.   ''There's more at stake here than the President's ability to conduct foreign policy,'' asserted James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, between calls to influential senators.

Including the latest results, growth of the M-1B money supply measure remains far below the minimum 6 percent annual growth target that the Federal Reserve set before the year began. M-1B, which now totals $433.9 billion, consists of currency plus all types of checking accounts, and is used by economists as a proxy for the amount of money the public has available for spending.

The message, one of the Western envoys said, was clear: Mr.  Chiluba, the chairman of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions, was presenting himself as an alternative to President Kenneth D. Kaunda and his United National Independence Party, the country's only lawful political group.   Mr. Chiluba's aspirations did not go unnoticed by the President. On July 4, after a series of strikes in Zambia's copper mines, he ordered the detention of Mr. Chiluba and three other union leaders.

A Geneva-based financial group announced today that it had acquired more than half the capital of Paribas (Suisse), the Geneva subsidiary of Compagnie Financiere de Paris et des Pays-Bas, the big French investment bank that is on the Government's nationalization list.   Andre de Pyffyer, president of the Geneva group, Pargesa Holding S.A., said today that he might attempt ''other operations concerning the international holdings'' of Paribas. There have been reports that Pargesa is preparing a takeover bid for one of the major Belgian assets of Paribas, an industrial holding company called Copeba, with assets of about $250 million."

Charged by the Finnish Constitution with responsibility for the nation's foreign policy, he has been an activist President, guiding Finland into participation in international affairs unthinkable when he first won election in February 1956 at a time of uneasy relations with the Soviet Union, with which Finland shares 788 miles of border.    The Finns, under President Kekkonen, have gradually enlarged their freedom of maneuver while pursuing a policy designed to keep the Soviet Union convinced that its security is not being imperiled through Finland. For Moscow, the most important component of the policy, which stresses neutrality and friendly relations with all nations, particularly the Soviet Union, has been the person carrying it out, President Kekkonen himself.   The most notable example of this policy is the special trade agreement Finland signed in October 1973 with the European Economic Community, which the Soviet Union had long denounced."

He said the Speaker of Parliament, Sufi Abu Taleb, would serve as interim President pending an election in 60 days.   The assassins' bullets ended the life of a man who earned a reputation for making bold decisions in foreign affairs, a reputation based in large part on his decision in 1977 to journey to the camp of Egypt's foe, Israel, to make peace. Sadat Forged His Own Regime   Regarded as an interim ruler when he came to power in 1970 on the death of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Mr. Sadat forged his own regime and ran Egypt single-handedly. He was bent on moving this impoverished country into the late 20th century, a drive that led him to abandon an alliance with the Soviet Union and embrace the West."

The authors of the study, Douglas T. Stuart and William T. Tow of the University of Southern California's School of International Relations, have explored the topic and its ramifications.   One of their conclusions is that the United States and China will continue to expand arms trade in the medium term but that ''actual weapons purchases will probably be infrequent and of limited financial or military importance.''"

The accord is viewed by Americans as a significant step by the determinedly neutralist Government of President Ne Win, which has refused economic aid from either the Soviet Union or the United States since it came into office by military coup in 1962. Diplomats said Burma continued to ignore offers of assistance from Moscow.   The only American aid that Burma has been accepting is in narcotics suppression. Since 1974 the United States has supplied 26 helicopters and 5 transport planes to help the Burmese Army fight rebel groups that cultivate, transport and refine opium near the eastern frontier.

Normal communications with The Times's Warsaw bureau chief, John Darnton, have been barred by authorities there since Dec. 14.   The Communist Party has been almost totally eclipsed by the military authorities running the day-to-day affairs of the martial law Government, but that does not mean the party is a spent force in national life, Western analysts in Warsaw believe.   ''I have a feeling that the party's interests are being looked after,'' said one well informed person, who pointed out that since all of the top military men are also party members, it is hard to tell where the army leaves off and the Communist Party begins.   The authorities, including Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who heads the military, the party and the Government, have gone to great lengths to insist that the takeover of Dec. 13 was not a coup d'etat.

They have advanced about 17 points since late October - a $170 gain per $1,000 face value and easily the largest increase in bond prices in more than 18 months.   While the higher prices cut the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds to 12.77 percent late yesterday, from 15.22 percent on Oct.27, interest rates on shorter-term issues such as Treasury bills have dropped by even larger amounts. Yesterday, for example, the Treasury sold new one-year bills at an average rate of 10.506 percent, which resulted in an 8.34 percent yield for the special one-year tax-exempt savings deposits, popularly known as ''All Savers'' certificates.   Until the new rate goes into effect next week, banks and other financial institutions may pay a 10.71 percent rate on the one-year tax-exempt certificates. They were first offered Oct.1 at a yield of 12.61 percent."

But a senior Western diplomat who met with top Soviet officials after President Reagan proposed a mutual renunciation of the missiles later reported that his Kremlin contacts had advised him not to take too seriously the contemptuous commentaries on Mr. Reagan's offer that were made in the Soviet press. The implication, the diplomat felt, was that the President's proposal would receive a more careful hearing in Geneva.   The initial Soviet response to the Reagan proposal was to castigate the President for adopting the guise of a peace-maker while putting forward an offer he knew Moscow would refuse. According to the Russians, Mr. Reagan's purpose was to ease antinuclear protests in Western Europe and so clear the path for the deployment of a new generation of American missiles that would give Washington firststrike ability against the Soviet Union's strategic missile force."

After a series of cautious and restrained American statements, the President intended his sharp news-conference declaration to provide psychological support for the Polish people without either encouraging violent resistance against the Polish Government or provoking the Soviet Union to intervene with force.   To the leadership, Mr. Reagan showed both stick and carrot. It would be impossible, he asserted, for Washington to respond to Warsaw's continuing pleas for food, credit and other economic assistance during a period of martial law when ''thousands are imprisoned and the legal rights of free trade unions, previously granted by the Government, are now denied.''"

Professor Tobin, who was a member of President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers, won the prize for his scholarly analysis of financial markets. Among his latest writings is a section on inflation for a new ''Encyclopedia of Economics,'' to be published next month by McGraw-Hill. Here is an excerpt: Measurement of Inflation   T O measure inflation over a month or a year or decade, it is necessary to average the diverse changes in thousands and thousands of specific prices. This is not easy, and it is bound to be arbitrary. If prices all moved together in proportion, there would be no ambiguity about the direction and amount of change in the price level. But they do not; relative prices are always changing. In practice statisticians, usually in government agencies, calculate price indexes. In three indexes commodities are weighted by their importance in comsumer budgets, or in the gross national product (G.N.P.), or in other aggregates. Indexes with weights differing in concept or in base data give different results."

The shortage of meat and other commodities was one of the causes of the birth of the Solidarity free trade union, which has led protests against the Government, in the summer of 1980.

The most recent indication came from Treasury Secretary Donald T.

The gross national product has declined in this year's second and third quarters and is showing no sign of an upturn. If the Administration is to come anywhere close to its forecast of a 5.2 percent increase in real G.N.P. next year, Secretary Regan thinks monetary policy will have to be eased now."

McIvor, 53, deputy chairman of Imperial Oil Ltd. of Canada, will become chairman and chief executive officer on Jan.1, succeeding John A. Armstrong, 64, who will retire. Mr. McIvor, a geologist who joined Imperial in 1950, assumes the top post at a time when the company, Canada's largest integrated oil concern, is facing serious pressures because of its 70 percent ownership by the Exxon Corporation.   Canada's National Energy Program, announced 13 months ago, favors Canadian-controlled companies by granting them exploration incentives in ''frontier'' areas on a sliding scale according to their degree of domestic ownership. These incentives are denied to foreignowned concerns, but Imperial has some degree of protection because about 48 percent of its earnings are from nonpetroleum sources."

As China's first English-language newspaper since the Nationalists shut down their presses and fled to Taiwan in 1949, China Daily has become a success six months after it started formal publication, with a circulation up from an initally cautious 20,000 copies to 50,000 today.   It was devised for foreigners, but two-thirds of its readership is Chinese -often ranking bureaucrats - who brush up on their English while enjoying a less restricted view of the world than is normally found in the Chinese press.   ''Our newspaper is mainly geared to foreign readers,'' said Guan Zaihan, who serves on the China Daily editorial board. ''That's why we serve so much foreign news. But we also want to tell our foreign friends about China.''"

It was even possible to speak of a climate of faint hope. The Western diplomatic mission left Windhoek this afternoon in its American Air Force jet without a definite response from South Africa or the political parties here to the constitutional guidelines it presented this week. But it seemed unlikely that any of the key parties to the dispute over South Africa's continued occupation of a territory it once held on a League of Nations mandate is prepared to see negotiations break down over constitutional questions.   ''People realize that this is the only game in town,'' said a senior American diplomat in the five-nation mission. His point seemed to be that rejection of the constitutional principles would mean scuttling the chance for a negotiated settlement - or in the case of the smaller political parties, of being left out if it does move ahead."

This view is virtually unanimous among United States and NATO analysts, who add that there is no question of the loyalty of senior officers to the military regime established by Gen.

The decision of the Grumman Corporation pension plan trustees to use the plan's holdings of Grumman stock to foil a takeover attempt by the LTV Corporation raises fundamental questions about the fiduciary responsibilities of pension fund managers and how much control companies can exert over the funds they contribute to the plans.   Should the managers' sole concern be short-term return on investment? Or can they make what may appear to be more unorthodox investments if they adopt a longer-term view? To take the case of Grumman, is it wise to make investments that benefit the company sponsoring the pension plan?   The last question resembles those raised when New York City was wrestling with near bankruptcy a few years ago and the city's five big pension plans purchased Big Mac bonds. Critics said that an impartial party, not concerned with the city's welfare, probably would not have made those investments. With corporate takeovers and mergers on the rise, it is likely that more companies will view pension plans as a tool to finance or fend off a takeover."

At the same time, the Public Prosecutor's Office has launched an investigation into the activities of Peruvian dealers and collectors who are said to act as the agents for foreign buyers.   The export of artwork has been prohibited since 1929. But the law has failed to stop a boom in the trading of gold and silver objects, colonial-era paintings and centuries-old pottery."

The letter, not yet formally delivered to members of the Senate, is intended to win support for Mr. Reagan's proposal to sell Saudi Arabia $8.5 billion in air defense equipment, including five Airborne Warning and Control System planes as well as tanker aircraft, missiles and fuel tanks to increase the combat capability of 62 F-15 fighters.   A draft of the President's letter spoke of four ''arrangements'' that would be incorporated into written agreements with the Saudi Arabian Government. One provides for an agreement to maintain physical security for the Awacs planes, their manuals and other equipment and for ''periodic inspection'' of such facilities by American experts."

You might be in a tiny minority, but as an investor, you know that big rewards, not to mention big losses, can go to those who put their money where their hunches are. So, allowing for your stout-hearted disposition and your belief that the nation will switch to gold, where should you put your money?   Above all, you bet against inflation. Under a gold-based system, the Government would agree to exchange a specified amount of gold for dollars at a fixed price. This linkage, say the proponents of a gold standard, would bring rigid discipline to the money supply by discouraging the Government from printing ever more dollars to pay ever-rising debts. In time, inflation and interest rates would plunge and then stabilize.   Whether gold enthusiasts will eventually prevail depends largely on the President, who can start the process by reopening the ''gold window'' for foreign central banks through an executive order.  (Congress, however, would have to enact legislation to return the country to the gold standard.) Mr. Reagan, who as a candidate urged reinstitution of the gold standard but who has been less vocal on the issue since, appointed a commission in August to study some way of linking gold to the dollar. He has indicated that he would wait for its findings - due by March 1982 - before taking any action."

''He helped improv e a world tormented by malice and pettiness. Most important, he was a humanitarian unafraid to make peace. America has lost a close friend, the world has lost a great statesman, mankind has lost a ch ampion of peace.''"

In analyzing the remarkable success of Japanese consumer products in penetrating the United States market, perhaps too much attention has been paid to such products' vaunted technological superiority as against the consummate marketing skill of the Japanese in enhancing American consumers' awareness of their products through advertising and other channels.   Short of turning the Ginza into Times Square East, American companies seeking to increase their share of the huge Japanese consumerproducts market might do well to learn from some for the marketing tactics of their Japanese competitors abroad.

The President, who has prided himself as a leader of secularization in the Islamic world, is described by aides as worried over the impact of increasing fundamentalist charges that he has steered this Western-oriented North African country out of the Arab mainstream. He is said to be concerned that the fundamentalists may succeed in shaking the political stability that has prevailed in Tunisia since its independence from France 25 years ago.   No one appears to know how widespread the fundamentalist movement is, but the Government cracked down on it in September after militants made anti-Bourguiba speeches in mosques. Sixty-eight fundamentalist leaders were tried and found guilty of defaming the 80-year-old President and were sentenced up to 12 years in prison."

Industry analysts also believe that Crocker, now the nation's 13thlargest bank holding company, could join the top 10 within two or three years.   But there are nagging doubts about whether Crocker's eclectic management will be able to turn its rich potential into hard profits.  ''The big question is whether managerially they can pull it off,'' said James J.
