Aquino said today that the leaders of the Communist insurgency had not yet responded to her offer to hold talks and that she would give them about six months to do so.   Interviewed on the Government television station on the eve of the arrival of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Mrs. Aquino also said she hoped American expressions of support for her new Government would translate into ''massive'' aid."

In advance of today's regular auction of new three- and six-month bills, the outstanding three-month issue was bid late Friday at 6.31 percent while the six-month issue was at 6.43 percent. Before Thursday's auction of $9.25 billion of new one-year bills - an issue the Treasury sells every four weeks - the outstanding one-year issue was bid late Friday at a rate of 6.49 percent.   To raise cash needed to continue Government operations until its cash balance is restored by midmonth tax receipts, tomorrow the Treasury will auction $5 billion of special 15-day cash management bills. The bills are sold in minimums of $1 million, and non-competitive bids are not accepted."

Craig Coats Jr., a managing director in charge of the government securities department at Salomon Brothers.   As was the case on Thursday, the bulk of the selling occurred among longer-term issues, which because of their maturity are generally viewed by traders as highly speculative instruments."

The Soviet Union has not conducted a nuclear test since it adopted a self-imposed moratorium Aug. 6. The United States has detonated nine nuclear explosions since that date.   In Moscow, the official Soviet press agency Tass denounced the test today as a ''dangerous destabilizing step'' that cast doubt on American reliability as a negotiating partner.

Joan Beck had the kind of job few young investment bankers would abandon - he was a managing director in London for prestigious Morgan Stanley & Company, specializing in Eurobonds. But when Mr. Beck had a chance to take a similar post at rival Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., he jumped without hesitation.   ''In the Euromarket, you cannot go higher than Credit Suisse First Boston,'' says the 39-year-old Mr. Beck. Indeed, the firm's top people are constantly being wooed by rival firms trying to catch up in the rapidly expanding Eurobond market, the international trading arena where corporations and governments come to raise money. Headhunters talk of the ''C.S.F.B. premium,'' the extra bonus that top Credit Suisse First Boston traders command if they choose to join a competitor. One dealer, who left for a higher position and a big bonus at another investment bank, says: ''C.S.F.B. is a great place to be from - it's gold on the resume.''   As John M. Hennessy, the firm's American chairman and chief executive, likes to boast, Credit Suisse First Boston is the I.B.M. of the Eurobond market. ''We are the biggest distributor of bonds and people,'' he says. ''But losing people hasn't hurt us. We're stronger today than we've ever been.''"

The move dramatizes the shift in control of the company, which was formed when the larger Internorth Inc., long based in Omaha, acquired the Houston Natural Gas Company a year ago for $2.3 billion.   Since then, Kenneth L. Lay, who had been the Houston company's chief executive, has been named chairman and chief executive of the merged concern, and several executives from both companies have left. Mr. Lay said that by the end of 1986 the company expected to relocate about 75 employees to Houston, while another 90 are expected to take early retirement or be offered a severance package."

In going after real estate interests, raising capital gains taxes and imposing a corporate minimum tax, the Packwood bill does both the hard thing and the right thing.   But the hard thing is not always the right thing, even in the admirable Packwood bill. Ending the deductibility of Individual Retirement Account contributions for most taxpayers was the hard thing for the Senate Finance Committee. It has generated more criticism than the rest of the bill put together. Yet it was the wrong thing. Limitation of the I.R.A. provisions would raise relatively little revenue but would significantly reduce personal savings and impair future growth. The Senate could make a good bill better by restoring I.R.A.'s."

It also said that it was temporarily laying off 6,600 workers at two car assembly plants.   The company said it would offer a financing rate of 5.9 percent on 30-month loans from its General Motors Acceptance Corporation subsidiary for the purchase of Chevrolet Chevette, Pontiac Fiero, Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Buick LeSabre models.

According to a transcript of a meeting of the Los Angeles County Bar Association on April 2, Judge Casseb told a questioner referring to New York law: ''I feel that there is a good chance that perhaps I may have read the cases wrong, and not have applied it correctly, and as I've said, you know, this is my first experience in trying to analyze New York law after I did 46 years with Texas, so you can see, that can happen to any judge.

At the same time, the Administration has quietly established indirect contact with leaders of the outlawed African National Congress, the most prominent of the groups seeking to overthrow the South African Government, he said.   Conceding a ''shift in emphasis'' in American policy, the official indicated that the United States was moving quickly to open new channels, especially to those it considered nonradical blacks and ''various factions of the white community,'' amid concern about a worsening situation in South Africa. Dialogue Called Key Goal    The key goal of American policy, the official said, remains a dialogue between blacks and the South African Government."

Many of the facts given here have been made public earlier.   On the 26th of April at 1:23 A.M. explosions occurred in the fourth unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power station.

Although Mr. Petricioli did not clarify his remarks, financial experts here interpreted them as meaning that Mexico will seek a temporary suspension of at least a part of the $1.8 billion coming due for payment in July.

It was a close call for Kodak. Although the company was the lowest bidder, it almost lost out because of business dealings half a world away. Kodak had sold film to the South African military, putting it at the mercy of a year-old New York law that allows city officials to bypass low bidders who do business in South Africa.   Kodak got the contract, but only after it pledged to cease dealing with any government agency in South Africa. ''The purpose of the law was not to punish contractors, but to encourage them to stop supporting apartheid,'' said Mayor Edward I. Koch at a news conference after the contract was awarded. Peter F. Vallone, the City Council majority leader, adds: ''This is a tremendous example of how New York City can shape corporate policy.''   Congress seems to be thinking along the same lines.

For businesses, taxes would increase by about $100 billion, but the extra bite would be soothed somewhat by more favorable depreciation rules and other provisions.   The plan faces a fight in the full Senate, however, where special interests, which were excluded from the closed Finance Committee meetings, would have a chance to restore some favorite preferences. And the bill is vastly different from the one passed by the House last year. But the plan has the backing of President Reagan, and specialists generally acknowledge that many, if not most, of its provisions are likely to survive."

Denmark called Moscow's delay in admitting the accident ''totally unacceptable,'' and Sweden warned that Moscow's failure to disclose details of the accident could set back future relations between the two countries.   But Finland, which along with Sweden absorbed the highest doses of radiation in the Nordic region, was silent. The official explanation is that such reticence is a matter of diplomatic style."

Instead, they said they would focus their efforts on prodding House and Senate tax writers to retain the sales tax deduction in any final House-Senate compromise package.   The group's decision to refrain from pressing a fight on the Senate floor reflects the prevailing view that few amendments are likely to be successful in the face of heavy opposition from Republican leaders to changes in the committee bill.   Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, has warned that he has a coalition of Senators ready to defeat any and all amendments in order to keep the committee bill intact. The strength of this coalition is expected to be tested this week when several major amendments are put up for a vote."

Through individual donations and corporate sponsorships, organizers of Sport Aid said they hoped to raise as much as $150 million for the victims of famine and drought, making the run the largest single fund-raising event in history.   Only in the United States, where the event clashed with the better publicized Hands Across America fund-raiser for the hungry and homeless, was the reception accorded Sport Aid seen as a conspicuous disappointment by organizers. The reception in America disturbed some Sport Aid figures, especially because a central event was the lighting of a symbolic torch at the United Nations by Omar Khalifa, a champion Sudanese runner."

Indications are that the explosion would more likely have been caused by a mechanical problem with the gear, possibly an exploding tire, than by a bomb or other terrorist's device, they said. None of the indicators that normally point to sabotage, such as residue of explosives or telltale patterns of structural rupture, have been detected so far, the informants added.   The Mexicana Airlines jet was on a flight to Los Angeles, with two domestic intermediate stops, when the crew declared an emergency and asked permission to return to Mexico City, the takeoff point. Minutes later the plane, on fire and shedding debris, smashed into a 9,000-foot mountain 100 miles northwest of the capital. All 166 people on board were killed."

Officials of the program, formally called the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly known as ''Star Wars,'' deny that there is serious damage, saying that any problems are minor and that the program as a whole is moving ahead vigorously.   But in more than two dozen interviews with a wide range of aerospace experts inside and outside the Government, analysts said the grounding of the nation's shuttles and expendable rockets had thrown a schedule of space-based experiments into confusion and disarray, sending shock waves through research programs across the country and demoralizing some scientists in the antimissile program. Plans for Giant New Rocket    Another repercussion, they say, is the effect on a controversy over whether the Government should start now to develop a giant new unmanned rocket - far larger than the shuttle - to lift thousands of antimissile weapons, sensors and aiming and tracking devices into space."

The announcement followed the receipt of intelligence information that Syria has begun to produce its own chemical weapons and has been discussing cooperation in that field with Iran.   In March 1984, the United States, concerned about Iraq's use of mustard gas and nerve gas in the Persian Gulf war, imposed a ban on the sale of similar chemicals to either Iran or Iraq."

Bacchus, the jazz purchaser for Tower Records's Greenwich Village store.   Seems he had the right idea. ''In a record store, Windham Hill is the first place I head for,'' said Rod Watts, 30, a psychologist from New Haven who had dropped into Tower Records's uptown store. ''I'd much rather buy one of these albums, even if I haven't heard it, than buy some other musician or label cold.''   Mr. Watts is not alone in his loyalty to this small San Francisco record company. To him, and to thousands of others, the Windham Hill label means soft, soothing music, a sound that is soppy and even soporific to its detractors but that has vast appeal to the young, upper income listeners Windham Hill wants to reach."

Many who do not share the largely leftist political views of the exiles express outrage at their continuing banishment, saying that one of the most painful things a person can suffer is not being allowed to come home.   Only about 2,000 people have returned from political exile out of 200,000 who fled, according to Humberto Lagos Schuffeneger, a lawyer at the Vicariate of Solidarity, the human-rights office of the Archdiocese of Santiago. Mr. Lagos, who spent five years in Belgium for what he described as ''some problems,'' said 40,000 to 45,000 of those abroad are considered to be actual exiles and the remainder of the 200,000 are family members. #3,719 Prohibited From Returning Of the exiles, only 3,719 are specifically prohibited from returning, their names having been published on the exclusion lists of the Ministry of Interior. But Mr. Lagos said that others were kept out because they acquired the citizenship of the country where they took asylum and that still others were hindered by bureaucratic red tape. But the majority, he said, do not return because of a combination of economic concerns and ''the fact that the same political conditions exist that provoked exile in the first place.''"

So far, the Syrians have not installed any military hardware in the trenches, which have been carved to provide earthen protection to fit both armor and long-range artillery pieces, the Israeli and Western sources said.   Nonetheless, there is considerable concern among Israeli military and political leaders about what they call the Syrian ''creeping'' to within 10 to 15 miles of the Israel-Lebanon border, and only 5 to 10 miles from the strip that Israel has declared a ''security zone'' in southern Lebanon. The development accounts in part for the current tension between the two countries."

But Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist for Morgan Stanley & Company, does not share the optimism. His reason:   A key indicator, capital spending, has ''screeched to a virtual standstill,'' he said.   Since early 1985, capital outlays have grown at an annual rate of about 2 percent - one-tenth the speed of 1983 and 1984, the first two years of the current recovery, Mr. Roach said."

But they said such presentations to the committees were normally in broad strokes.   This particular presentation, made in late 1985 or early 1986, was in the form of either a written memorandum or an oral briefing, and the ambiguous language served two purposes, officials said. It provided justification for supplying more and better arms to the rebels, and it signaled to those in Congress who wanted to do more that Mr. Reagan was on their side."

At an antiaircraft missile site along the gulf, nearly 300 Soviet advisers refused to leave their underground bunkers despite Libyan appeals for help in putting up new launching pads during the incidents, the sources said.

Retail gasoline prices had risen steadily through the late spring after falling to about 90 cents a gallon in late April. Today, at less than $1 a gallon, prices remain about 28 cents a gallon below the level of a year ago.   ''People at every level are beginning to worry about moving their product,'' said Daniel Lundberg, a gasoline industry consultant, referring to refiners, distributors and gasoline marketers. ''That's why prices are dropping.''"

The new technology has knit trading centers around the globe into a single international market. It has also encouraged the development of new financial products, accelerated the pace of trading and added to its volatility. In recent years, the following four technologies have been most important:   Telecommunications. Satellites, transoceanic cables, microwave stations, and fiber optics have made it almost as easy to deal with banks on the other side of the world as it is to deal with banks across the street. Multinational banks and brokers have set up private lines that link their currency trading rooms into intercontinental networks that allow them to match a New York bank with one in London or Tokyo if the price is better than one offered locally."

The only known connection between the Palme case and the assassination of Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean Ambassador to the United States who was blown up in a car in Washington in 1976, was supplied by an American citizen named Michael Vernon Townley. Mr. Townley eventually confessed to having conspired against Mr. Letelier on behalf of the Chilean secret police.   Mr. Townley, who eventually testified as a prosecution witness in the case against three Cubans charged in the assassination, was reported in 1979 to have told the F.B.I. that he had received orders from his Chilean sponsors to make an attempt on Mr. Palme's life at a 1976 meeting in Madrid of Social Democratic parties.   The Swedish Prime Minister was cooperating in that period with Mr. Letelier and others in efforts to make an international pariah of the Pinochet regime. He had also been active in making Sweden and other Scandinavian countries a haven for Chilean political refugees."

Yesterday's action in the equities market, however, was a classic example of how bond prices can sometimes have an impact in a roundabout way. Traders said the credit markets first caused a decline in the value of stock index futures, and this in turn dragged down the price of stocks late in the session.   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 5.64 points on Friday, lost another 14.76 points, to 1,861.95, yesterday. The blue-chip index was about 9 points higher midway through the volatile session, which ended with several big brokerage firms unloading stocks in favor of the heavily discounted index futures."

At the same time, reactor construction experts expressed doubt yesterday that the Russians would be able anytime soon to build a concrete catchment under the reactor to contain nuclear fuel if it did melt through the basement of the Chernobyl unit, or to otherwise encase the plant in concrete.   The consensus among experts is that the accident is not yet over: that inside the reactor is a mass of up to 2,000 tons of molten nuclear fuel mixed with concrete, steel, fuel cladding, graphite and anything else that the hot radioactive core chewed up as it began to slump from the accident.   There is no nuclear fission, or chain reaction, the experts said, because it requires a specific engineered configuration and a way to trap neutrons -both of which have been lost. Most of the radiation has already been released, they said. #5,000 Degrees in the Molten Mass What is left instead is the enormous decay heat of the reaction, 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit in the molten mass. Also left is the heaviest radioactive elements from the nuclear core, since the lighter and more volatile fractions have already escaped with the initial explosion and graphite fire, the experts said."

At a crowded midday meeting of the World Bank staff association in the floral courtyard of the 19th Street headquarters, a senior British-born economist said the issue was both pay and the professional independence of the staff. ''Who do we work for -political appointees or the people of the world?'' he asked to loud cheers and applause."

While the Congressional debate on overhauling the Federal income tax is far from over, and the final outcome is still not certain, individuals now have proposals from both the Senate and the House to help guide their investment decisions.   The package unanimously approved last month by the Senate Finance Committee headed by Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon differs in important detail from the bill passed by the House of Representatives last December. And it is likely to be amended during debate on the Senate floor this month. Under the House bill, for example, an individual's contributions to a 401(k) employee retirement plan would reduce dollar-for-dollar the amount of tax-deductible contributions he or she could make to an Individual Retirement Account. Under the Senate committee bill, no I.R.A. deduction could be claimed by a taxpayer who is covered by a pension plan. But interest earned on I.R.A. contributions could still grow tax-free until withdrawn."

Dulles, head of the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1950's.   Karl J. Gruber, 78, a former anti-Nazi resistance leader who served as the Austrian Foreign Minister from 1946 to 1953, said the recommendation came from the Foreign Ministry's young first secretary, Fritz Molden, heir to an Austrian publishing empire. Mr. Gruber said Mr. Molden gave Mr. Waldheim a strong recommendation after checking Mr. Waldheim's background with the four Great Powers, including the United States. At the time, Austria was under Allied occupation.   ''Molden investigated him and found no material on him, nothing, nothing,'' Mr. Gruber said in a telephone interview from Washington. He added that Mr. Molden ''soon became the son-in-law of Allen Dulles and so had the opportunity to do a thorough investigation.''"

One conclusion is certain: ''Strange things'' are done ''by the men who moil for gold,'' as the poet Robert Service once wrote.   In this instance, International Corona Resources Ltd., the little guy, took giant Lac Minerals Ltd., one of Canada's most aggressive mining operations, to court to complain about being misused. Last month, after one of the biggest judgments in Canadian history, Corona walked out of a Toronto courthouse with a smile and a $3 billion gold mine."

But diplomats here, headquarters of the 90-member GATT, which works to expand and liberalize world trade, say there is little chance that the Soviet Union would gain such observer status anytime soon. They said industrialized nations such as the United States and the European Economic Community would block the consensus decision needed for Soviet membership or observer status, for political as well as economic reasons."

Meanwhile last week, the Senate Finance Committee nearly blocked President Reagan's attempt to widen trade with Canada, and the acrimony over protectionism in agriculture reached the point where the Common Market's ambassador to Washington called American charges ''hogwash.''

''At this point, it looks pretty clear that virtually no amendment is going to succeed on the floor,'' said Jonathan W. Fleming, an aide to Senator Cranston who is working on a Cranston-Boschwitz amendment to preserve preferential treatment for capital gains."

In another illustration of what Wall Street has come to call ''gang hiring,'' Merrill said it had hired away from Chemical Timothy L. Tabor, a successful arbitrager, along with the two other executives in Mr. Tabor's unit, Ted Scott and Spencer Lambert. Mr. Tabor will immediately become director of risk arbitrage at Merrill with the two other executives reporting to him, the brokerage firm said.   To make room for Mr. Tabor, Merrill said it was promoting Thomas Burnett to the newly created position of director of international equity trading. Mr. Burnett will be responsible for overseeing the coordination of Merrill's trading activities of foreign stocks in New York, London, Tokyo and Toronto."

Miss Broome, 28 years old, faces possible life imprisonment for shooting Francesco D'Alessio, a member of a wealthy horse-breeding family, who she says insulted her repeatedly and treated her obscenely.   Her trial, which began last week, attracted many journalists and spectators, and it had to be moved to a larger courtroom. Aside from its prurient appeal, the trial has attracted much attention because it casts a shadow of scandal on some high-living and well-connected social circles. It also touches on a more general concern about the increasingly widespread use of cocaine by affluent young people in Italy."

Downtown, in the offices of one of Chile's many political parties, all theoretically illegal, hangs a photocopy of a newspaper front page for Feb. 26 on which the headline announcing the departure of President Ferdinand E. Marcos from the Philippines has been altered to read, ''Pinochet Resigned and Went Into Exile.''   But those who write or post such things and those who spend most of their waking hours analyzing Chilean politics consider it unlikely that Gen. Augusto Pinochet could be so easily removed after 12 years as Chile's ruler.   The explanation for that belief may lie in the other Halley-Pinochet line making the rounds in Santiago: As the comet began its movement away from Earth in its 75-year cycle, the 70-year-old President bade it farewell with the words, ''Until next time.''   While there is continuous public debate in Chile, with encouragement from the United States, about the possibility of freely electing a new president in 1989 or sooner and reinstituting all the trappings of democratic pluralism, General Pinochet himself has given no sign that he finds such ideas appealing."

But many financial experts say that a passive approach is the wrong way to go. Among the strategies they suggest are these:    * Selling certain appreciated stocks now, so that profits can be taxed at the current favorable rate on long-term capital gains;    * Reinvesting the proceeds in tax-exempt securities, such as tax-free money market funds or short-term municipal bond funds;    * Purchasing tax-favored investments such as universal life insurance policies;    * Holding onto existing tax shelters instead of trying to unload them in the secondary market."

Last year's reunion in Bonn was swamped by emotions stirred up by President Reagan's visit to the Bitburg military cemetery, at which some S.S. troops were buried. It now looks as though this year's economic summit conference, to be held in Tokyo from May 4 to 6, may be overwhelmed by debates over how to deal with international terrorism following the United States air attack on Libya and the refusal by France, and Spain as well, according to a member of the Spanish Cabinet, to let the American planes use their airspace.   President Reagan has said that at Tokyo he will press for stronger joint action against Libya and terrorism. France's denial of its airspace to American planes, he added, was ''a subject that must be discussed.'' Mr. Reagan said some European nations were already talking about ''a wider-based and more all-out effort'' against Libya."

There are many reasons why a certificate may be obsolete - the company may have changed its name, gone into bankruptcy, or merged with another entity, to name a few.

Apparently, the trade-off of tax preferences for lower tax rates was irresistible.  At first, though, the committee followed its usual practice of handing out tax favors having no rhyme or reason other than to help favorite constituents. But it soon found that it was losing too much ground and that there was no place to stop. It then reversed gears and went in the opposite direction, promoted by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and others, of broadening the tax base and using the increased tax revenues to cut rates. That's something that many of us have been advocating for years, and we heartily endorse it.  The howls of the special interests reflect the true nature of comprehensive tax reform. The elimination of tax preferences hurts the few, while the rate reductions help the majority who pay taxes on all or most of their income. The result is that individuals and businesses with the same income will pay more nearly equal taxes. Equity will be better served, and the huge economic distortions created by the present system will be reduced."

They learn about their pension, their Social Security benefits, their coverage under a company health plan and the role of Medicare. But there is much more that individuals should consider in planning for retirement, the experts say.   As retirement approaches, many people look at their four walls as a profit center. Sell the house, the theory goes, and buy another more convenient, smaller one or buy a condominium and receive a tax advantage under current laws.   Certainly a home lived in for 10 to 20 years or more has probably gained a lot in value. However, some persons live in houses that are not too big for their needs."

The role of our financial system is overlooked. It shouldn't be. By favoring short-term, high-return deals at the expense of riskier, long-term investments, the capital markets discourage investment in the companies and technologies that we need to compete in world markets.  The capital markets' short-term bias, which has developed over the past decade, robs industry of the capital it needs to move new technologies out of the lab and into the market. Investors' time horizons are now out of step with the incubation periods of critical new technologies. At the same time, financial deregulation has spurred rapid - often chaotic -change just when key industries need stable financial relationships.

In the 141-page document brimming with references to Satan and to the coming of the third millennium, John Paul sought to focus the attention of Roman Catholics on the Holy Spirit, the mysterious third person of the Trinity whom Christians revere, along with the Father and the Son, as the one God.   The encyclical, ''Dominum et Vivificantem'' (''The Lord and Giver of Life''), is a highly personal revery by John Paul on one of the richest but most elusive concepts of the Christian faith - in the Pope's words, the ''hidden God'' who is the Holy Spirit. Harsh Critique of Modern World   But John Paul, as is his habit, used these reflections to undergird a harsh critique of the modern world, with ''its signs and symptoms of death,'' and of ideologies he sees as destroying a spiritual vision of humanity.   He underscored the importance he ascribed to his message by issuing it as an encyclical, which is the most formal teaching instrument of the papacy."

The meeting was scheduled to last one day. But the two men talked for more than five hours, then held a second meeting two days later. If you were to research the meeting in your school library, you would find that U.S. News wrote, ''Among the problems they discussed were some of the world's biggest: Vietnam, the Middle East, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.''   Today, historians have concluded that the Glassboro summit was not, in fact, one of the most momentous - no major breakthroughs were made or agreements reached. Nevertheless, the two men met. They were frank. They worked to understand each other and to make themselves understood. In this alone, I would submit, they taught us a great deal.   This brings me to the international scene and our relations with the Soviet Union. It is important to begin by distinguishing between the peoples inside the Soviet Union and the Government that rules them. Certainly we have no quarrel with the peoples - far from it. Yet we must remember that the peoples in the Soviet Union have virtually no influence on the Government."

The higher rating, which applies to more than $3.5 billion of state bonds, is justified, Moody's analysts said, by a stronger economy and improved financial condition. But the state's high level of outstanding debt and the variety of other bonds issued with state backing preclude a return to the high-grade Aa rating that was in force before the fiscal crises of the mid-1970's, a Moody's official said."

In fact, it has been priced so low recently that earlier this month the Hecla Mining Company, a major silver miner, announced the closing of its Lucky Friday mine in Mullan, Idaho, the layoff of 241 miners and 56 laboratory and exploration workers, as well as sharp pay cuts for other workers and executives.   Last year Lucky Friday produced 4.7 million ounces of silver, which was more than any other United States silver mine, but Hecla lost $4.2 million.   Commodity experts believe that the mine, one of the world's largest producers of the metal, will remain closed for quite a while. The company loses money when silver moves much below $6 an ounce. Early this month the price was as low as $4.80 an ounce for actual silver one day and $4.99 for the May futures contract on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Late last week the spot price improved slightly, to $5.125. Analysts said one reason was that more mines might close, thus tightening the supply."

The issue, potentially the most important arms-control decision to be made in the second term of the Reagan Administration, has divided State Department and civilian Defense Department officials.   It has also emerged as a potentially divisive issue for the United States and its Western allies, who support continued adherence to the agreement.   Administration officials said they expect a tentative decision to be made within days. Then, Paul H. Nitze and Edward L. Rowny, two arms control advisers, will consult with United States allies. Upon their return, a final decision will be made, officials said."

People were saying that the man needed cue cards to talk about the gross national product.   Here, at his sixth economic summit conference, the man still needs help. Before dinner with the other six leaders on Sunday night, reporters were firing questions at him as he and his fellow leaders stood for photographs, and Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan would whisper in his ears. But they whispered the questions, not the answers. All the help Mr. Reagan seems to need, at 75 years old, is a better hearing aid. Learning to Compromise    President Reagan is riding high here.

It was enough to inspire envy, if not fear, in the hearts of his Wall Street competitors. There was the childhood triumph over polio, followed by a brilliant academic and football career at West Point. A quarter-century stint in the Army brought yards of combat ribbons for service in Vietnam; at 43 he was named brigadier general, and he seemed on the way to fulfilling his football coach Earl Blaik's early prediction, ''He's a cinch to make Chief of Staff.''   But at 45, General Dawkins tossed his military career aside and moved to the lucrative world of investment banking. Since his abrupt announcement in May 1983 that he would retire from the military, Dawkins-watchers have been waiting for their hero to make his mark on Wall Street. The going has been slow."

The Commerce Department's revised figures on gross national product, which showed that the economy grew by 2.9 percent in the first quarter rather than the 3.7 percent reported earlier, were viewed by most economists as further confirmation that second-quarter growth will be quite weak and that growth in the second half of the year will not be nearly as robust as once expected. While such an outlook would be favorable for the credit markets, there was little reaction yesterday from traders.   ''We had a wonderful 30 or 40 seconds after the G.N.P. came out, but then the market just sort of moved sideways,'' said James Cochrane, chief economist for Texas Commerce Bancshares, a Houston-based bank holding company."

In a mad scramble to draw in dollars - which the companies could then invest at sky-high rates - many property and casualty insurers abandoned their traditionally conservative approach to writing insurance. An orgy of price-cutting ensued, with some companies eagerly leading the way and others dragged along. And for a time that strategy worked. Investment earnings poured in, more than offsetting the red ink that began to flood the business of writing insurance.   But now interest rates have fallen, and insurers are paying the price. So, too, are consumers, businesses, professional people, local governments - nearly everyone who buys insurance. When the music stopped, the insurance companies found themselves swamped with high-risk coverage for which they had charged too little. The increased willingness of the courts to broaden the notion of liability has only made matters worse."

That is the lesson of the past several years and the biggest reason that more records may well be set in coming months, according to many professionals.   The rate of advance in the Consumer Price Index has slowed to a crawl, and in some recent months has actually fallen. The index dropped four-tenths of 1 percent in both February and March, the first back-to-back decline in the nation's most widely followed inflation gauge in more than 20 years. For the first three months of 1986, prices fell at an annual rate of 1.9 percent, prompting some economists to predict that inflation at the consumer level could be as little as 1 percent this year and, barring a sharp rebound in oil prices or a collapse in the dollar, only 3 percent or so next year. This would be the best two-year performance since the halcyon investment climate of the early 1960's.   Low inflation is not the only bright spot on the economic landscape these days."

A successful meeting, however Japanese politicians and newspapers ultimately define it, had been widely regarded as critical to Mr. Nakasone for any hope he may entertain to stay in office after his term expires next fall.   Thus far the conference has not gone the Prime Minister's way. It could produce serious consequences for him and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party if he goes ahead with plans to dissolve Parliament's decision-making lower house and hold national elections late next month."

As the General Assembly met today to discuss ways to slash this year's budget following drastic cuts in the United States' contribution, Mr. Perez de Cuellar told reporters, ''The United States should reduce its contribution to, I don't know, 20 or even 15 percent and then some other countries should increase their contribution.'' The United States currently is assessed 25 percent of the regular United Nations budget of $830 million.   Responding to questions at the annual luncheon of the United Nations Correspondents' Association, the Secretary General suggested that each of the five permanent members of the Security Council, which have veto power, should pay equal shares of the budget to create what he called a ''fair and honest'' system."

Several mining companies, including one owned by the French Government, have been lured to the area by deposits five or six times richer in uranium content than ore from the handful of old mines, built in the days of the American uranium boom before the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, that are still operating.   In the last few years nearly a million acres of high, sage-covered land have been staked out in 45,000 uranium claims between the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona and the Utah state line. The area, totaling some four million acres of wild and empty space, is known as the Arizona Strip. Four mines are already in operation, with several more planned."

While N.S.A. officials refuse to discuss the change publicly, they have told industry officials in recent weeks that the new system, which will be phased in at Government agencies and corporations beginning in January 1988, will use a variety of new codes whose distribution will be tightly regulated by the agency.

A statement issued by the ministers from eight of the 12 Common Market nations said the agreement reflected recognition that nations must work together to effectively fight terrorism.   The United States officials, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, William Webster, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Robert Oakley, director of the State Department's counterterrorism office, also met with some of the ministers, including Home Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain.   Mr. Hurd told a news conference that the American officials ''suggested in a very courteous and understanding way that it would be valuable if there was a procedure which doesn't now exist for contacts between the Common Market and the United States Administration.''"

Gorbachev's television address tonight on the Chernobyl nuclear accident, as distributed in translation by the Soviet press agency Tass:   Good evening, comrades.   As you all know, a misfortune has befallen us - the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It has painfully affected Soviet people and caused the anxiety of the international public. For the first time ever we encountered in reality such a sinister force as nuclear energy that has escaped control. So what did happen? As specialists report, the reactor's capacity suddenly increased during a scheduled shutdown of the fourth unit. The considerable emission of steam and subsequent reaction resulted in the formation of hydrogen, its explosion, damage to the reactor and the associated radioactive release.   It is yet early to pass final judgment on the causes of the accident. All aspects of the problem - design, projecting, operation and technical -are under the close scrutiny of the Government commission."

Comex Clearing processes transactions and helps maintain the financial viability of clearing firms on the Commodity Exchange, where Volume Investors operated.   The suggestion, by Judge Kevin T. Duffy, at a hearing last month, came amid a bitter dispute between lawyers for the clearing association, which may lose up to $9 million because of Volume's failure, and Volume's court-appointed receiver, over how much the receiver and his lawyers and accountants will be paid."

With the approach of another key vote by the House of Representatives on the President's proposal, majorities of those polled accepted his argument that Nicaragua is a risk to American interests, but opposed his remedy of $100 million in aid.   Only 38 percent knew that Washington was supporting the guerrillas and not the Government. That confusion extended to the nature of Nicaragua's Government, which is aligned with the Soviet Union; just 20 percent said it was Communist, 19 percent said it was a right-wing dictatorship and 49 percent said they didn't know. Nicaraguan Threat Perceived    Nevertheless, after questions about the Reagan aid plan had been asked, a more defined image of Nicaragua seemed to emerge. Fifty-nine percent of the 1,601 adults interviewed by telephone from April 6 through 10 answered yes when asked if they thought the Nicaraguan Government would provide the Soviet Union with military bases, and 56 percent agreed that Nicaragua constituted a threat to the security of other Central American countries.

You can pay a Volkswagen-sized downpayment, but drive away with a Ferrari, and yet, if you turn your head, even for a moment, the Ferrari may turn into a heap of scrap metal.   Futures and options are ephemeral creatures. With a share of stock, you have bought an interest in a corporation that can usually be held as long as you like. With a bond, you have bought the right to receive a steady rate of return, often for years or decades. With a future or option, though, you have latched onto a perishable commodity that requires constant attention, a steady flow of decisions and the kind of cool head that the smaller investor is notorious for losing when tensions build.   In short, futures and options are probably the most volatile, risky and complex products that the individual can invest in outside of Atlantic City. On top of that, options and futures commissions tend to be significantly higher than those for other investment products, such as stocks. So the cost for changing one's mind can be high."

As Japan sells more and more goods abroad - with its trade surpluses growing ever larger - its trading partners around the globe feel threatened in their home markets and shut out in Japan itself. Amid this mounting hostility, a spate of blue-ribbon reports have recommended that Japan start relying on domestic spending and imports for economic growth rather than on exports.   It is by no means clear that Japan has the political will or the popular mandate to make such changes on its own. The proposals being discussed face obstacles deeply rooted in Japanese ways.

Soviet officials made the commitment at a meeting last week in Vienna of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the American official, Harold R. Denton, director of reactor regulation at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said today.   While the Russians provided frustratingly few technical details of the Chernobyl disaster at the Vienna meeting, information gleaned from ''hall talk'' with Soviet officials confirmed earlier indications that the reactor was being used in experiments when the accident occurred, Mr. Denton said.   Soviet officials have given no indication of what those experiments might have been. Some Western experts suspect that the reactor was being used to produce plutonium for weapons."

''Most shareholders just don't understand the tax consequences of mutual funds,'' said Glenn O. Head, chairman of the First Investors Management Company, Inc., which manages mutual funds. ''They don't realize that, when they pick up the telephone to switch money from one fund to another, it's considered a taxable sale.'' However, a little strategic planning can minimize Uncle Sam's share of the take and smooth your exit, say the experts, whether you are selling a few shares to lock in profits or checking out of your fund altogether.   For example, investors who request telephone switching privileges within a fund group may also want to open an account with the company's money market fund. That way, they can switch shares from their equity or bond fund to their money market fund and then write a check against the balance. This ''lets you get your hands on the cash a week or two faster'' than it typically takes a mutual fund to process the paperwork and mail the check, which must then clear your local bank, said John Markese, research director at the American Association of Individual Investors."

In New York the stock market plunged, with analysts attributing part of the record 41.91-point drop in the Dow industrial average to fears that the accident would inflict a devastating blow on the United States nuclear industry, although utility stocks recovered somewhat yesterday. Worldwide prices of grain, livestock, cotton and other commodities have shot up in response to anxiety that radioactive fallout might create shortages in the Soviet Union and other countries.   This could be the greatest shock to hit the world economy since the oil price explosion caused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries during the 1973-74 Arab-Israeli war. In a sense, the current shock from the Chernobyl disaster is itself traceable to the oil price explosion, which gave additional impetus to many countries to try to replace petroleum with nuclear energy."

Last year, the division, G.M.'s second largest after the domestic United States unit, lost $372.1 million, about $80 million more than in 1984. The widening loss came despite fast-selling models that helped G.M. dramatically widen its European market share last year to 11.4 percent, from 9.6 percent as recently as 1982.

We abhor the increase in the level of such terrorism since our last meeting, and in particular its blatant and cynical use as an instrument of government policy. Terrorism has no justification. It spreads only by the use of contemptible means, ignoring the values of human life, freedom and dignity. It must be fought relentlessly and without compromise.

Terrorism must be fought effectively through determined, tenacious, discreet and patient action combining national measures with international cooperation.

And since the members of the audience were all advertising people -some of whom were listening to Mr. Smith, thanks to simultaneous translations into Japanese, Korean and Spanish - most were familiar with the moves already being taken at G.M. The company has brought in Phil Gurascio, an agency media heavyweight, from one of its shops in an all-out attempt to get multiple-title magazine publishers to hammer out new favorable volume and frequency discount deals for the auto giant."

As for himself, the 46-year-old senior vice president is forecasting annual double-digit gains in both broadcasting and advertising in Europe alone for the next 20 years. So it does look like a man who also wears the hat of chairman of the Global Media Commission of the International Advertising Association and was once a White House adviser on telecommunications policy is in a position to capitalize on such credentials."

This voluntary-savings arrangement has exhibited a remarkable resiliency in Congress. Scheduled for elimination in last fall's Treasury proposal for tax revision, the plans survived in the House tax reform bill with a proposed cap on employee contributions of $7,000. Then the Senate Finance Committe voted earlier this month to raise that limit to $12,000, ignoring the acid observation of its chairman, Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, that the ''tax code is not designed to let the elegant live very exquisitely when they retire.''"

Discussions on ways to solve the debt problem had been under way for months, but the crisis was precipitated but the plunge of the peso, which fell 30 percent in six days. The rescue package would require Mexico to sign a letter of intent with the I.M.F., promising to take steps to expand its economy. In return, Mexico would get $6 billion in new, one-year loans, including some from the I.M.F. and the World Bank.   Some of the loans would have to come from commercial banks in the United States, and the Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, said lenders should be lenient. But many commercial bankers, seeing their problem loans mount up, say they are reluctant to throw good money after bad and will require some guarantees beyond the letter of intent with the I.M.F."

Members of Congress and the Administration said they had been aware for some time of the charges against the commander, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is viewed as the leader of Panama.   Asked to comment on a report Thursday in The New York Times on the activities of General Noriega, Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said, ''These are serious charges, but they have been around a long time.''

[ 2 ]  Developments since our last meeting reflect the effectiveness of the policies to which we have committed ourselves at successive Economic Summits in recent years. The economies of the industrialized countries are now in their fourth year of expansion. In all our countries the rate of inflation has been declining. With the continuing pursuit of prudent fiscal and monetary policies, this has permitted a substantial lowering of interest rates. There has been a significant shift in the pattern of exchange rates which better reflects fundamental economic conditions."

Khrushchev banging his shoe at the United Nations.   In August 1958 heavy shelling by the Chinese Communists threatened to draw the United States into China's civil war. But in the years since the 1960 Presidential campaign, when the islands figured prominently in the race between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, the names of Quemoy and Matsu (about 150 miles farther up the coast) have largely receded from the American consciousness.   But on the islands, particularly those in the Quemoy group, barely a mile and a half from the mainland at their closest point, time has in many respects stood still. What has changed are the Nationalist fortifications, which have turned the cratered wasteland of a generation ago into one of the most expensively defended stretches of real estate anywhere."

The Congressional Budget Office put the figure at $208 billion. But Gert Von Der Linde, economist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, says it will be higher. Current patterns of revenue-gathering and spending, he says, suggest a deficit of $222.6 billion for fiscal 1986, which ends on Oct. 1.   Nearly all sources of Government revenues are behind expectations, says Mr. Von Der Linde. The outlook for revenues from taxes is dimming, especially if wages grow slowly and corporate profits fall. The outlook has worsened recently, he says, as tax uncertainties - including the possibility of a lower marginal tax rate in 1987 - encourage individuals and businesses to defer income until next year."

The police, 1,100 men and women plus two attack dogs, took turns assaulting one another and defending themselves, their weapons of choice alternating among bare hands, rubber knives and toy guns. Several officers, posing as visiting heads of state, subjected themselves to mock assassination attempts, ducking for safety behind human shields as shots rang out.   The backdrop of the wedding-cake guesthouse, called the Geihinkan in Japanese, gave the exercise a faint backlot air. But the police could not have been more deadly serious."

The measure would exempt the Phillips Petroleum Company from paying an excise tax on money it plans to withdraw from the company pension plan. Phillips would use the money to help pay debts accumulated in fighting off hostile takeover bids in 1984 and 1985.   The Senate voted, 74 to 13, to defeat an amendment offered by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, that would have eliminated the special rule for Phillips. The exception, if it becomes law, would save Phillips $106 million in taxes over the next five years, according to staff experts."

This year, an improvement in exports and ''a better picture for imports by Labor Day'' should ultimately contribute about one percentage point to his estimate of 3.5 percent real growth in gross national product from the fourth quarter of 1985 to this year's fourth quarter.

The tax law changes, in particular those that the Senate Finance Committee adopted unanimously last week and that President Reagan has endorsed, mean that the tax system would play less of a role in shaping society and its economic foundations.   This is in part because the changes would diminish the tax code's incentives to steer income to certain activities, and in part because it would let individuals keep more of their income, which they could then feed into the economy as they wished.   Just about all economists maintain that this would produce a sounder and healthier economy and, eventually, higher wages and lower unemployment. It leaves open the questions about prospects for the individuals, charitable organizations and businesses that the tax system helps protect and that an efficient economy tends to overlook."

On Friday, the Cologne tabloid Express published the text of the accord, which was signed in Washington on March 27 by West Germany's Economics Minister, Martin Bangemann, and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. The newspaper and an energy newsletter also plan to publish copies of accompanying letters to the agreements on research on the program commonly known as ''Star Wars.''   As with a similar memorandum of understanding reached with Britain in December, the Pentagon had requested that the text be kept secret. Well-placed American officials said this was because the Pentagon will be negotiating such understandings with several countries and did not want to weaken its bargaining leverage by disclosures of what had been conceded to other countries."

But then a frenzied takeover battle suddenly turned it into one of the most sought-after utilities in the country.   Complete with lawsuits, ''lockup'' provisions and golden parachutes, the fight first pitted the top executives of the company against shareholders and then turned into a free-for-all that included numerous bids from four outside groups.   Last Friday, the feverish contest -13 offers were made in all - apparently came to an end when Alamito said it had accepted a bid from one of the groups, Osceola Energy Inc., for $165 a share in cash, or $376.2 million. As part of the deal, it was agreed that Alamito's executives - who had been accused by the shareholders and Osceola of trying to spirit the company away for a fraction of its value -would stay on. Why the Interest?  Why were so many bidders so interested in such a low-profile company?"

Her American-born daughter, Olga Peters, also left the Soviet Union, to return to a private school in Britain.

Anderson, a former Moscow correspondent of The New York Times who is now a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Here are excerpts from their conversations.   Q. I'm sure that the No. 1 question about you right now in this country is why did you decide so abruptly, and surprisingly, to leave Britain in 1984 and fly to the Soviet Union with your daughter?

The new offer is also said to permit long-range sea-launched cruise missiles rather than banning them as before. These missiles would then be counted in the total of 8,000 nuclear bombs and missile warheads. This contrasts with the proposed American ceiling of 6,000 ballistic missile warheads and air-launched cruise missiles only.

Rather, it was the sound of musical accompaniment.   The Government denied any responsibility for the assault near sign-off time on April 29, just as it did for the raid five days later on Radio Nanduti's transmission station 12 miles outside Asuncion, where masked gunmen stole vital pieces of electronic equipment.   Yet a tape recording made by a cool-headed technician of the first cacophonous attack brought an interesting revelation. The band that accompanied the 100 or so attackers could distinctly be heard playing two polkas, ''General Stroessner'' and ''The Colorado,'' familiar tributes to Paraguay's longtime dictator and his party."

When this is accomplished, it could be possible to eliminate human diseases and birth defects as well as improve crops and livestock. More important, an understanding of the fundamental structure of genes will disclose one of the secrets of how molecules combine to form living things.   Until recently, mapping gene sequences was a rigorous task. Genetic instructions are encoded in a distinctive pattern of four chemical bases, nucleic acids linked in pairs - adenine to guanine, cytosine to thymine. A typical gene contains about 3,000 bases, linked together like pearls on a necklace. The human genetic code, for instance, is 3.5 billion bases long. Since the discovery of the double-stranded structure of DNA in the early 1950's, scientists have only managed to decode the entire genetic instructions of a few simple viruses."

The Reagan Administration's determination to pursue a hard line on terrorism has troubled some Japanese officials, who worry that it may be too strong for them and may put them in an awkward situation as conference host."

Other top employees, including heads of shifts and senior technicians, are still absent from work after fleeing from Pripyat, the town where the plant is situated, the newspaper said.   The report gave few details of the specific accusations against the top executives. But it was the strongest suggestion to date of extensive confusion and negligence after the explosion that ruptured the Unit 4 reactor at the Chernobyl plant in the early hours of April 26, releasing a cloud of radioactive materials. Twenty-six people have died as a result of the disaster at the plant, near the Ukrainian-Byelorussian border."

Diplomats from the United States, Britain and France denounced the East German move as an attempt to establish an international frontier between East and West Berlin. Under postwar statute, the three NATO powers and the Soviet Union have nominal control over all of Berlin; the three Western allies do not recognize its division.   The East German border guards asked that foreign diplomats passing through Checkpoint Charlie, the main crossing point between East and West Berlin, show their passports and not their red passes accrediting them to the East German Foreign Ministry."

Earlier in the day, seven Christian Lebanese men were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen as they traveled from West Beirut to East Beirut."

The rally had driven yields on the notes down to 7.27 percent in pre-auction trading, a sharp drop from the 7.66 percent at which dealers were offering them last Thursday. Dealers said that Japanese investors, who at one point were thought to be interested in as much as $2 billion of the new notes, proved to have less enthusiasm with the yields so low."

Although the personal computer is far more complicated than a toaster, the purchase and maintenance of the two devices have to a certain extent come to parallel one another.   I was reflecting on this state of affairs over a toastless breakfast not long ago. Our old two-slice appliance was about the same age as the faithful, dual-floppy personal computer that had graced my desk for some three years. On that particular morning the toaster had proceeded to send me a series of error messages, repeatedly ejecting slices of rye bread as soft and cold as they had been when first inserted. A new toaster was definitely in order. Having the old one fixed was certainly out of the question, for I knew that even getting someone to look at it would be more expensive than the cost of a brand new toaster."

Thereafter, the full group met with him on two occasions, although not with other detainees.   The group approached the meetings with Mr. Mandela with another measure of care. It was impossible not to be aware of the mythology surrounding him, but equally, we were determined that it should not color our impressions or influence our judgment. As far as possible, we resolved to approach these meetings with an open mind.   We were first struck by his physical authority - by his immaculate appearance, his apparent good health, and his commanding presence. In his manner, he exuded authority, and received the respect of all around him, including his jailers. That in part seemed to reflect his own philosophy of separating people from policy."

But the various financial considerations can certainly be weighed in detail.   A person's savings, and company retirement benefits are, of course, a major factor in this calculation and will vary, depending on the individual and his or her pension or profit-sharing plan. Medicare benefits do not begin until 65, even for someone receiving Social Security benefits at an earlier age, so adequate health insurance ought to be assured until then. Furthermore, many people cannot afford to retire before 65 and live comfortably without a regular paycheck."

Pakistan's forces along the mountainous border between the two countries were placed on full alert, the officials said.   The Foreign Ministry issued a brief statement on the air clash near the border town of Parachinar and warned Afghanistan's Soviet-backed Communist Government to halt such attacks or face the consequences."

In addition to the unusual joint venture with the investment banking firm, Occidental said it had signed a letter of intent to sell the oil and gas exploration and production subsidiaries that it acquired in its recent purchase of the Midcon Corporation. Those units will be sold for about $500 million in cash to a joint venture of the Davis Oil Company and the Apache Petroleum Company.   The deal for part of the Diamond Shamrock Corporation comes 16 months after a courtship by Occidental of Diamond Shamrock crumbled in Shamrock's board room in January 1985. The two oil and chemical companies had discussed a merger for two years, and twice they had seemed on the verge of a deal."

But Sam Nakagama of Nakagama & Wallace Inc., says one reason the rate may be stuck is that in January the Government began including millions of illegal immigrants in its jobless calculations.   ''With falling oil prices devasting the Mexican economy,'' said Mr. Nakagama, ''Mexican workers have been pouring into this country.'' Thousands who enter illegally will not be apprehended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, says Mr. Nakagama. And there will be few jobs for them, with rising unemployment in the auto, mining, manufacturing, oil and farm industries. The result, he says: ''The jobless rate will rise to 7.5 percent or more this spring and possibly stay there.''"

Mr. Bowsky was talking about the special coins minted by the Treasury to commemorate the 1986 Statue of Liberty Centennial. With a portion of the purchase price used for restoring the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, these pieces represent the first time that the statue has appeared on American coinage."

Then the owner of the house told him the place was secure, and he came in from the cold of a southern African winter's night to talk.   To a waiting reporter, the man's appearance seemed to have changed radically since a previous meeting, as had his style of dress. The fiery labor leader - in disguise and in hiding from detention under South Africa's newest emergency decree -could have passed for a college student or a clerk. But the message he bore was grave."

Brioni, the largest of an archipelago of 14 islands, vaguely resembling stretches of the Maine coast, was bitterly contested in centuries of wars and was heavily bombed by Allied planes seeking to drive German forces from the island's shores in World War II."

From big time real estate entrepreneurs such as Donald Trump to suburban homeowners, many investors have seen their initial outlays multiply, whether in shopping malls, office complexes or residential property.   To be sure, leverage is powerful. It can provide big profits with relatively small investments. And it can be employed in many areas beyond real estate, in buying stocks and commodities, for example. But leverage also has a dangerous downside, even in real estate, and especially speculative real estate. Leverage can escalate the profits if the value of the investments rises, but it also magnifies the losses if the investment fails.

Art Kressly, the proud new owner, says he got value for his money. ''Oscar has good quality wool, a heavier bone structure,'' said the Lynnport, Pa., breeder. ''All in all, his proportions are perfectly structurally pleasing to the eye.''   Prices have been consistently rising for a top-of-the-line llama. Cheryl Dal Porto, editor of Llamas magazine, recalls: ''In our first issue, seven years ago, females were selling for $1,500.'' Now breeding females sell at an average price of $6,000 to $10,000; males start at around $750 for a pet or pack animal."

But members of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, Miss Dean's union, voted by a margin of 3 to 2 against accepting the $63 million that would have been their share of the total package.   Two other unions, the National Graphical Association and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, voted down the Murdoch offer by even heavier margins.

Since the raid, President Reagan has warned that the United States is ready to use its military power to retaliate again if there are new attacks.   But in interviews in recent days, White House and State Department officials expressed concern that the public support that developed for the bombing of Libya would not necessarily be repeated if Washington became engaged in a regular pattern of tit-for-tat retaliatory raids. 'Relatively Easy Target'    Such raids might be mounted not only against Libya but also against such nations as Syria and Iran, which are believed by the Administration to support terrorist groups.   ''Libya was a relatively easy target, and we lost one F-111,'' a State Department official said. ''Syria and Iran are more dangerous. We probably won't get away with such minimal losses. I wonder how long the polls will show a high approval rating in this country if the losses begin to mount without any evidence of ending terrorism.''"

Last week, the General Motors Corporation, in a reversal of a stance it held for many years, said it would stop selling vehicles to South African military or police agencies.   In recent months, the leaders of other large corporations with major operations in South Africa, including the International Business Machines Corporation and the Xerox Corporation, have raised the possibility that they might end their operations there if business conditions continue to deteriorate.   At least 48 American companies have pulled out of South Africa since the beginning of last year, according to a study by the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a not-for-profit organization based in Washington that studies issues affecting investors and corporations.

While the bank has been accorded respect by officials overseas for intervention efforts that brought the dollar lower against the yen than any other foreign currency, in Japan, it has been the object of political heat generated by the adverse effects of the strong yen - more expensive exports and lower corporate profits."

That is the purpose of computer systems that design computer chips. The systems are known as silicon compilers -programs that act like a trusted assistant. Give the compilers a general idea of what you want them to do and they will take care of the details.   But despite much ballyhoo, silicon compilers have failed to catch on as fast as expected, according to analysts and vendors. One reason, perhaps surprisingly, is that electronics engineers can be as reluctant as anyone else to adapt to computers."

But when the store opened four years later on Lexington Avenue at 86th Street, it became evident to the Gimbels management and to other retailers that the new store was just as close to East Harlem, one of the city's poorest communities, as it was to one of Manhattan's wealthiest neighborhoods.   With its L-shaped footprint straddling the line between wealth and poverty, the store never managed to establish its own identity, much less remake the neighborhood around it into a fashionable shopping district as the company had hoped. And its repeated failure to attract shoppers was indicative of the company's irreversible decline, first out of the hands of the Gimbel family and now on its way out of business altogether. Real Estate Move    After months of trying to find a buyer who would continue to operate the 86th Street outlet as a retail store, Batus Inc., the owner of Gimbels since 1974, has decided to sell it and the flagship store at 33d Street and the Avenue of the Americas for real estate development."

But in seeking to diversify beyond shirts, stoves and stereos, many analysts say, Sears has paid too little attention to its roots and left the retailing foundation of its empire vulnerable.   Lower-price chains like Wal-Mart and such regional discounters as Crazy Eddie and Highland Superstores have wooed customers away from Sears. Product loyalty has eroded, with many shoppers now shunning the Sears and Kenmore house brands in favor of sexier names, like Sony or Esprit, that are not sold at the company's 800 department stores. And Sears's cumbersome distribution system has become an expensive drag on operations.   The result has been six consecutive quarters of flat retail sales and a steep drop in operating income in the company's merchandising division -it fell to $447 million last year, from $656 million in 1984. Sears's troubles have been dramatic enough to prompt talk that the K Mart Corporation, the nation's No. 2 retailer, might soon take over the top spot."

Rules against conflicts of that sort have long been a part of the symbiotic relationship between advertising agencies and their clients, and a key point of contention.   Advertisers and agencies alike have now been forced to take another look at the issue in light of the continuing consolidation of the major ad agencies and the mergers in recent years of such marketers as Philip Morris and General Foods, R. J. Reynolds and Nabisco, and Procter & Gamble and Richardson-Vicks.   Strict policies on conflicts of interest have been stretched, sometimes to the breaking point, by the wave of combinations.

A fairness letter works something like this: Suppose management of a publicly held corporation wants to take the company private in a leveraged buyout. Clearly, the transaction is contemplated only because management believes it can pay its stockholders less than the real value of the company. Indeed, why else would management want to buy the company unless it could see a profit on its investment, and where else would the profit come from except from paying the real owners of the company - the stockholders - less than the company was worth?"

TACTIC PUTS CONTRA AID ON HOLD,"  Using a surprise parliamentary maneuver, House Republicans today ambushed the Democratic leadership and foiled attempts to attach President Reagan's request to aid the Nicaraguan rebels to a supplemental spending bill.   Representative Robert H. Michel, the Republican leader, said the Democrats had been playing a ''con game'' with the rebel aid issue because the $1.7 billion spending bill was headed for a Presidential veto that would also kill the aid package.   Addressing a chamber that was charged with partisan rancor, Mr. Michel drew cheers from Republicans when he asserted, ''We refuse to play the roles assigned to us by the directors of this farce.''   But the day's events left the ultimate fate of the President's aid request in doubt. Republican leaders said they had devised a strategy that could force a floor vote on the President's request as early as May 12, and they predicted that the request would pass."

In an interview, the commander, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, insisted that he and the army would continue to play a major role, together with the civilian President, in running the country. But General Noriega is widely seen as the true wielder of political power in the country and the army has either imposed or deposed the last five presidents.   ''The role of the defense force in this country is different from any other armed forces,'' General Noriega said.

South Africa yearns to be accepted as a country of Western democratic values, but to maintain its system and self-image it enforces the information practices of authoritarian regimes.   In recent months South Africa's leaders have become increasingly resentful of foreign reporters, whose reports they blame for the country's woeful international image.   For more than a decade, South Africa has accepted the presence of a large body of foreign correspondents, as if to demonstrate it is part of the larger family of democratic nations. Another reason for permitting their presence is, perhaps, an unshakable belief that people in the United States and Great Britain, among others, will come to sympathize with the situation of white South Africans if their story is told abroad. All journalists heading to South Africa are familiar with some variation of the admonition from South Africans that ''you will see it is more complex than you think.''"

In the colonial era, these plants were called ''green gold'' for the pale fibers they produced, fibers that were combed and spun into twine that bound newspaper bundles, rope that secured ships to their moorings and threads that were woven into burlap sacks for potatoes and onions.   From immense estates on the edges of the Usambara Mountains here, Tanzania once produced the sisal that virtually dominated the world market. But in the last 15 years, that dominance has evaporated as prices for sisal have plummeted - in great measure because of the increased use of plastic fibers -and as the sisal estates deteriorated following nationalization by a determined Socialist government."

Mr. Gray was director of communications in the 1980 Reagan campaign and was co-chairman of the President's inaugural committee.   More recently, a public relations firm with even stronger ties to the White House was founded by Michael K. Deaver, former White House deputy chief of staff.

But representatives of the industries that would have to pay the taxes opposed them strenuously at a day-long hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, and the idea seemed to have little support among the committee members.   The excise tax proposal is a central feature of the tax-revision plan, which appears to be in serious trouble, that was put forward by Senator Packwood, the Finance Committee chairman and an Oregon Republican. It was the best way he could find, the Senator said, to generate enough revenue so that the top income tax rate could be cut to 35 percent from 50 percent, business investment incentives improved and other tax preferences maintained, without lowering total Government receipts."

The Senate Finance Committee has given its unanimous approval to a plan, introduced by its chairman, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, to chop personal income tax rates to two brackets, 27 percent and 15 percent; to lower the corporate rate from 46 percent to 33 percent, and to pay for these cuts by eliminating scores of deductions.   The concept of radically changing the tax system by cutting rates and broadening the tax base has long been supported by many economists, both liberal and conservative, who contend that a more neutral tax system would encourage more rational allocation of resources and hence promote economic efficiency and growth.   The major theoretical criticism of that argument, as noted by Roger Brinner and his associates at Data Resources Inc., an economic-analysis concern, comes from those economists who argue that income taxation is less pro-growth than consumption taxation. Hence, if a Federal tax system is based on income, a more balanced program of incentives to investment would be preferable to a neutral tax system, they say."
