The way computer processor speed is listed has changed, but what does it all mean? How can I find out how fast the chip is supposed to be if the gigahertz speed is not listed?    A. The computer's processor, also known as a microprocessor or central processing unit, is the brain of the machine; it sends information to other parts of the system. The processor's clock speed -- the rate of the chip's internal clock, dictating how fast it can chew through its computing tasks -- has been one of the main ways to describe the computer's overall power.     But earlier this year Intel, the maker of Pentium and Celeron processors, announced that it was changing the way it labeled its processors for desktop and laptop computers. In an attempt to describe more elements of a processor than just the clock speed, Intel will factor in variables including the design of the processor (known as the architecture) and the size of the chip's temporary memory storage area (known as the cache).
