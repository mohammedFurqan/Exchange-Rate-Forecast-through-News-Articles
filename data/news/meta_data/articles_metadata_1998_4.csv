United States employers added 267,000 workers to their payrolls in November as the jobless rate slipped to 4.4 percent, near a three-decade low.    It was the biggest gain in payrolls in three months and matched the pace of the year's first half, when many on Wall Street were more fearful of an overheated economy than of a recession. [Page A1.]    Mylan Said to Face F.T.C. Lawsuit  The Federal Government is preparing to accuse Mylan Laboratories, a big generic drug maker, of anti-competitive practices. The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has recommended filing a civil action against the company, which it said sharply raised the prices of its products after trying to corner the market on the drugs' raw materials. [A1.]    Unocal Quits Pipeline Project  Unocal has withdrawn from a consortium that planned an $8 billion energy pipeline system traversing war-torn Afghanistan, a company official said. The consortium, which brought together companies from Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea and Pakistan, had planned to build twin oil and gas pipelines from Turkmenistan to the Pakistan port of Gwadar. [C2.]    Republic Hires Sears Marketer  Republic Industries hired a top Sears, Roebuck marketing executive to be its president as part of its drive to raise the profile of its Autonation USA unit. John H. Costello, left, will be responsible for developing the marketing for the company, which owns the nation's largest chain of franchised new and used automobile dealerships. He will also oversee its retail and rental operations. [C2.]    Hollinger Selling 45 Newspapers  Hollinger International, the second-largest United States newspaper group, will sell 45 newspapers to Community Newspaper Holdings for $475 million. Hollinger said the papers to be sold are in 14 states. [C3.]    Buyers Bid Up Ubid Initial Offer  The stock of the on-line auction company Ubid ended the first day of trading with its shares closing at $48 -- more than three times the $15 offering price. Coming in the aftermath of several run-ups by Internet initial public offerings the last month, Ubid was able to offer the stock at a price beyond the original estimated range of $12 to $14. [C2.]    Scottish Power in Pacificorp Talks  Scottish Power was said to be discussing a deal to acquire Pacificorp, a big utility in the Northwest. The value of the potential deal was not known, but two British newspapers reported last month that Scottish Power wanted to buy Pacificorp for $6.6 billion. [C3.]    $1.5 Million Award in Air Bag Death  A Federal jury in Manhattan awarded $1.5 million to the estate of a 5-year-old boy killed after an air bag deployed in the front seat of a Dodge minivan where he had been riding without a fastened seat belt. DaimlerChrysler, the minivan maker, called the verdict unfair. [B2.]    Struggle Over Kenya Beer Market  The maker of Kenya's best-selling beer, which was named Tusker after one of the brewery's founders was killed by an elephant, is facing another behemoth. South African Breweries has taken on East African Breweries and its partner, Guinness, in what has quickly become a war over more than beer. [A4.]    Mexico Bank Bailout Held Up  After nine months of grueling debate, Mexican lawmakers have reached broad agreement on measures to refinance the Government's troubled $61 billion bank bailout. But a final accord has been stymied by a dispute over a top Government finance official.
