The R.D.S. technology allows a radio station to transmit data on the unused portion of its frequency, known as a subcarrier. Mr. Alwadish, 38, employed the concept in creating Coupon Radio, a car radio system that allows listeners to ""capture"" radio information with the push of a button, and gives stations and advertisers -- particularly record companies and music stores -- information about listeners' habits and tastes.

But something about the deal did not smell quite right to Alan R. Smith, an amateur investor and professional photographer in Fort Worth. So before he plunked down his $10,000, he spent far less on a phone call -- and found out the airline's chairman had a history of securities fraud.   Mr. Smith placed his call to the Detective Information Network, a fledgling service started this year by a pair of experienced professional investigators who think they are the first to bring the high-tech tricks of their trade to the general public. These are not your average gumshoes; rather, they are the Sam Spades of cyberspace, using computers and telephone lines to search through reams of public records -- the Mortgage Asset Research Institute's data base in Mr. Hall's case. Using Available Information    For a fee, these investigators will check out investment promoters, locate missing heirs, drum up deadbeats, even find old flames. And for less money -- about $25 -- they will tell you exactly how to do it yourself."

Cites Refco Account,"  In the early 1980's, when short-term interest rates were sky high, the concept of the ""cash management account,"" pioneered by Merrill Lynch, swept the brokerage industry. An important part of it was that idle cash -- from the sale of securities or dividend payments or any other source -- was automatically put into a money market fund.   Refco, a large commodities brokerage firm, was one firm that followed the trend. But its account was not like the others. Rather than invest the money in a money market fund, which purchased such securities as commercial paper and Treasury bills, Refco used the money to finance its own operations."

Burnett declined to take part in a broad creative review that Sony decided to conduct among other agencies as well as Burnett.   The Burnett resignation, though unusual, was not entirely unexpected. There were signs of problems on the account as top management at Sony changed several times and concerns were raised over whether the agency's work should stress products or Sony's brand image."

A President who opened up the nation's economy is under intense criticism for helping the rich and ignoring the poor. He is accused of turning his back on Mexico's rich past. An aura of violence and budding revolt hangs over his final months in office.    The last days of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari? No, a 155-episode nightly television soap opera about the life and times of Gen. Porfirio Diaz, whose 34-year autocratic rule ended with the first shots of the Mexican revolution in 1910."

And, if you're in the brokerage industry, there is apparently the right to conceal the price of the bonds you trade for customers. Or so it would seem from the sound of 348 letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission blasting the idea of 'fessing up to bond commissions.   The S.E.C. last March published a proposal that brokers begin divulging the markups -- or costs to customers -- on some of their bond trades. Innocuous as the suggestion might sound, it elicited a hue and cry from the securities industry, which apparently has a lot to lose should the public get smarter about what it costs to buy a bond."

Operating profits were falling and Whirlpool's stock was trading even lower than the bottom it hit following the 1987 crash. The company was in danger of planting the flag all over the map without really profiting from it. Whirlpool, Mr. Whitwam concluded, needed an outsider to harness the strengths of its growing ranks of partners, subsidiaries and suppliers."

A stricter regime on mortgage discrimination has long been a goal of many Congressional Democrats, and Clinton Administration officials have called for progress, not paperwork, on the issue. But the pragmatic case for an aggressive approach hinges on the assumption that mortgage discrimination is widespread. And on this point, some economists are raising serious questions."

Analysts said investor sentiment had been very bearish on Hewlett-Packard in recent weeks, so even though earnings came in just a few cents above the consensus estimate, the stock rose sharply in reaction."

Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, said House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to put the money in the 1995 military budget, virtually assuring it would win Congressional approval, The Globe said. In addition, Mr. Meehan's office said Raytheon would be given $69 million to modify Patriot launchers, radar systems and other parts so they work with a new generation of missiles being built by the Loral Corporation, the newspaper said. Raytheon, which had 1993 sales of $9.2 billion, suffered a significant blow in April when the Pentagon chose Loral rather than Raytheon to build the post-Patriot generation of interceptor missiles."

His four-party coalition has been a casualty not only of Sweden's economic crisis -- double-digit interest rates and Europe's most crippling budget deficit -- but also of nostalgia among voters for the salad days of the nation's cradle-to-grave welfare system. Since he took power in 1991, Mr. Bildt's reformist zeal has been aimed at reducing many of those benefits, as a way to trim soaring Government expenditures."

Style, the way investment professionals use the word, does not refer to hemlines or lapel widths or the chiffon-and-combat-boot look. On Wall Street, style means the way portfolio managers pick stocks and the kind of stocks they stay with. Consultants to pension funds get paid big money to come up with style categories and to put managers into them, a practice that is filtering into the world of mutual funds, as well."

Consider, for example, that the New York Rangers hockey team lost $3.7 million last year and, as recently as May, was expected to lose $7 million this year. The Rangers are now expected to edge into the black for 1994 -- but only as a result of the extra ticket sales and additional cable television revenue from the playoff season that culminated in June with the Rangers' first Stanley Cup in 54 years."

Just ask Zoe Baird, the erstwhile Clinton Administration nominee for Attorney General, whose nightmarish 15 minutes of fame may never end, thanks to the infinite ability of the English language to absorb new idioms. Whether the uproar over her revelation that she employed two undocumented aliens was fair or not -- and she has many off-the-record defenders -- the phrase ""to have a Zoe Baird problem"" has roosted in the vocabularies of the professional classes in any large American city with an immigrant labor force.    The phrase is now instantly recognizable code for failing to comply with any of the trillion or so immigration and tax laws that cover the employment of a foreign-born worker, especially a foreign-born worker who is not authorized to work. At a forum at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York last week, immigration lawyers and immigrant rights groups contended that the Zoe Baird problem was built into the process of finding and hiring someone to provide child care or other types of in-home care for family members."

He'd worked on programming at ABC and created the Fox network, and he's wanted to get back into prime time -- as witness his failed effort to buy Paramount. Laurence Tisch, at 71, has really treated CBS as an investment and is ready to cash part of it in. But don't think, as David Letterman suggested, that the ""60 Minutes"" stopwatch will now be ""yours for $49.95."" CBS will, however, get a desired foothold in cable. So why did both CBS and QVC stock jump so sharply? Perhaps because, as one CBS executive put it, Mr. Tisch just ""put the money in the bank,"" and now Mr. Diller will breathe life, and growth, into the company. Or perhaps, heaven help us, we're in for another bidding war. (Disney has been mentioned as eyeing CBS.)"

But, in fact, this disorder is brilliant leadership which rises above the bureaucratic interest in stability to grasp what is really at stake. For chief executives, here are four lessons.  * Don't stay the course when the sea changes. On Sept. 15, Mr. Clinton proclaimed that all peaceful channels had been explored for resolving the Haiti problem and that invasion was imminent. The very next day, he dispatched Jimmy Carter, Sam Nunn and Colin Powell to seek peace."

But a Government-financed study released last week by the Manhattan Borough President's office says there is a compelling reason for all that attention: despite the convulsions of the last 20 years, New York is still by far the largest book publishing center in the country.    New York's position is faltering in some ways, the report says. The study provides figures that bolster the impressions of New Yorkers in the industry, who have watched big publishers acquire smaller publishers or merge with other companies, and who have lived through round after round of dismissals and cutbacks at some of the city's largest companies. In fact, the industry is growing at a much larger rate nationally than it is in the city, meaning that New York's share of the nation's publishing work force has fallen significantly in the last 15 years."

In fact, automation usually requires higher skilled workers (albeit fewer in number), and they can command higher pay rates for these skills. We have machinists earning over $19 an hour and, in general, wages at Rotoflow have been growing much faster than the national average."

But you must specify which shares are to be distributed and either a dollar amount or the number of shares.   ""The distribution of securities or mutual funds is generally made by re-registering the shares into the individual name or personal account of the I.R.A. participant,"" said Joseph J.

Microsoft had been rumored to be facing strict monitoring of its relations with competitors and clients, or even a breakup of its operations into two companies. In the end, however, the Justice Department and its European counterpart demanded only modest changes in the way the giant software maker markets its products.   Not surprisingly, the consent decree was greeted with dismay by rivals most vulnerable to Microsoft's juggernaut, notably those that produce software applications like word processing, along with those that produce utilities -- anti-virus programs, for example -- that are often sold as a package with Microsoft's basic operating system. What may surprise is the lack of a passionate response from antitrust economists and lawyers."

Just Japan,"" Viewpoints, July 24).   Furthermore, Japan's increasing trade surplus has more to do with the appreciating yen than any underlying policy change in recent years. Japan is not any more of an export-oriented country now than in the 1980's. As recession arrived in Japan, however, companies restructured, slowed the recycling of overseas profit and slowed overseas expansion. There was a decline in overseas investment by Japan, which certainly increased demand for the yen and drove up its price. That may be one of the causes of its recent appreciation."

The reports on the invitation are part of a slow broadening of contacts with North Korea, as the United States leads efforts to halt Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program and North Korea seeks to end its isolation with economic assistance and broader diplomatic recognition. As part of that process, the Clinton Administration announced today that, as expected, it would begin technical discussions with North Korea on Sept. 10 to fill out some of the details of an agreement reached between the two countries last month in Geneva."

In so doing, he made it fairer to the thousands of small investors who own the partnership. But at the same time, he has made their choice more difficult.   The prisoners' dilemma involves the choices faced by two criminals who have been arrested and are being questioned by the police separately.

President Clinton was quick to point out that more than four million new jobs -- the number he pledged to produce by the end of this year -- have been created since he took office. That's all well and good, but he can't take all the credit. Last spring, the economy proved it sometimes has a life of its own; before the Administration was able to present its ill-fated stimulus package to Congress, payrolls jumped in May. Labor Secretary Robert Reich warned then not to ""put too much weight on a single month's numbers."" Last week, he said figures for July are ""further proof that job growth is continuing its solid, steady course."" In July, the economy created 259,000 new jobs, about 60,000 more than consensus forecasts. Average hourly earnings rose by 4 cents, to $11.12. Japan Trade Is a Sticky Situation  Talk about bad timing. The Clinton Administration has decided it's time to get tough with Japan on trade. Last week, it formally accused Japan of discriminating against American companies in awarding some contracts. But the Administration is putting on the gloves amid such dizzying political turmoil in Japan that the Asian target's outline is fuzzy: Japan has had four Prime Ministers in a little more than a year. A former United States trade official said prodding a decision out of the ""collection of ministries"" was like ""punching a marshmallow."" In the process, experts say, the dollar could spill the most blood -- if the United States gets so frustrated it drives down the dollar's value to sell more goods in Japan.  Paul Allen's Gizmo Search  Some Lollapalooza goers are getting more than they bargained for this year. Besides jamming to their favorite alternative-rock bands and hanging loose in the summer heat, some will likely help determine what will be the next gadget or two appearing on store shelves everywhere. Last week, Paul Allen -- a software billionaire who cofounded Microsoft and owns Ticketmaster and part of Egghead Software -- flew to Providence, R.I., to check out his $3 million technology exhibition roaming the country with the music fest. His goal is to discover the next big hit in consumer electronics. Among the computerized offerings the concertgoers experienced was the ""Baby Maker"" software program, which lets a couple -- regardless of sex -- combine their images digitally to see what their offspring would look like.  Clinton Wants R-E-S-P-E-C-T  Dissatisfied with the little bit of commendation he's getting for the economy's performance, President Clinton last week held a news conference to sing his own praises. The White House also brought out backup vocals: eight top economic officials who touted their agencies' successes in the last 18 months. Commerce Secretary Brown harmonized: ""I don't think that the President has gotten the credit that he has deserved."" Dog Days of Retail  The Gap made a little money in July. The Limited lost a little. But Sears and Woolworth lapped up gains. ""The trend in July is no trend,"" one retail analyst remarked. ""Sales are really all over the board."" Those erratic sales leave few clues about where sales are headed. The only thread of the retail story is that diversified retailers -- discounters and department stores -- are doing better than stores that simply sell clothing. Sometimes, much better. The merchandise group at Sears, Roebuck announced it sold more appliances the last week of July than in any other week in its history. COMPANIES Upjohn Pays its Probers  Did too! Did not! Did too! Did not! Whatever happened, Upjohn last week agreed to pay $650,000 to several state investigative agencies. In New York, the Attorney General said Upjohn violated state laws against deceptive and misleading business practices when, from September 1992 to March 1993, it paid pharmacists $8 every time a patient they consulted switched from one diabetes drug (Micronase, which lost its patent protection two years ago) to another (Glynase, which is still protected). Upjohn said last week it did nothing wrong in its marketing plan but it would pay eight states -- Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin -- about $84,000 each for their investigative costs.  Time Out at Nasdaq  For 34 minutes one day last week, Nasdaq trading was interrupted after a squirrel chewed through a power line and the stock trading system's backup power system failed to kick in. The hapless squirrel can be forgiven. But can the nation's second-largest stock market? It has, after all, donned the garb of a technological leader and seduced leading high-tech companies -- Intel and Microsoft -- that look mighty alluring on its arm. And the outage was only one of three technological breakdowns at Nasdaq since July 14.  Cyanamid Gets the Looks  Not long ago, American Cyanamid's dance card was empty. (Earlier this decade, when the company's focus was on manufacturing chemicals, it was an outcast that watched its stock price slide for two dreadfully long years.) In came a new C.E.O., who in the last 18 months has transformed the concern into a health care and agricultural products company by cutting costs and shedding sorry divisions. The makeover worked. Last week, American Home Products presented American Cyanamid with a surprise, $8.5 billion cash takeover offer, causing the company's stock to soar more than 40 percent. Several more suitors may be lining up. Securities experts say European drug and chemical concerns like Bayer, Ciba-Geigy, Hoechst and Zenaca could offer even better propositions. MGM Puts Faith in Vegas  How obsessed are Americans with gambling? Very, MGM and Primadonna Resorts suggested last week when they bet $300 million on yet another Vegas gambling center. (MGM itself just opened the nation's biggest casino resort there six months ago, at a cost of $1 billion.) The latest casino -- New York-New York -- is also one in a string of projects taking shape while Las Vegas luxuriates in a record summer. ""This is a sign of confidence in the Las Vegas market,"" said a University of Las Vegas professor, ""but this rush-ahead, rush-ahead philosophy is a gamble, and the fact that MGM cut someone else in indicates that they think it is something of a crap shoot, too."" What Now for Barry Diller?  It's a done deal -- unless a more generous offer surfaces in the next month. Barry Diller's QVC, the home shopping channel, is set to be taken over by the cable television giants Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast. If a better bid does come along, QVC would pay TCI and Comcast a $55 million breakup fee. Otherwise, as agreed last week, the cable duo will snare QVC for $2.5 billion. Ever since Diller joined QVC as chairman about a year and a half ago, he has been seeking a partner. He also courted Home Shopping Network, Paramount Communications and CBS. The restless Diller is not expected to stay. INTERNATIONAL Out of (South) Africa, Still  Jailed, he inspired song and sit-ins. The personification of how blacks were persecuted under apartheid in South Africa, he was the torch investor activists and students carried to light fires under American companies to divest themselves of operations there. But now that Nelson Mandela is free and leading his country, he can't get investors' attention. Last week -- 10 months after he formally invited foreign business to return -- a snapshot of investment activity since April showed more foreign money flowing out than in, despite the fact that advance scouts of Western dough last year promised investment if peace prevailed and Mandela embraced the free market. Now, potential investors complain about things like a costly labor force and trade barriers.  China Market's Painful Start   When the Chinese Communist Government held its reborn stock market by the feet and slapped its bottom to get it breathing in 1990, China was unprepared for the challenge -- and pains -- the market would bring once it started walking. While the market created quick fortunes for a handful of investors and hit record highs early last year, it wasn't long before it took a fall. Recent months brought a near collapse, and when many first-time Chinese investors panicked and sold off shares, they lost their life savings. Last week, however, the index for the Chinese-only A shares more than doubled. Some frustrated investors vowed to abandon the market and its vagaries. And others talked about ""winning"" back their losses."

American General, which has made a hostile $2.6 billion bid for Unitrin, a Chicago-based insurer, said the board's approval of the repurchase program automatically put Unitrin on the auction block. American General, based in Houston, is also seeking a court order to force Unitrin to provide American General with its nonpublic financial data, and drop its takeover defenses. The suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court. Unitrin announced on Aug. 12 that it would expand an earlier repurchase plan by 10 million shares, or more than 19 percent of its common stock. Unitrin said the move would bolster its undervalued stock."

One after another, and then by the dozens, rafts began appearing in the water in front of Havana's oceanfront, known as the Malecon, and a few miles east at Cojimar, which has become the main launching point for those who want to escape from Cuba. Many of the Cubans had been camping on the beaches for days, waiting for the weather to improve.   Trucks also began arriving, depositing people who had come from Alamar in the east and Pinar del Rio in the west, 120 miles away. The trucks carried boats that the refugees had been building at their homes. Because of the current in the Florida Straits, the coast around Havana is the best launching area for the mostly unpowered boats.    Hundreds of well-wishers lined the beaches near Havana as the exodus resumed. A Weather Predicter    No one has been able to predict the flow of refugees, but the weather has been one prognosticator, even better than pleas by Fidel Castro or President Clinton.    Indeed, there has been less science and method involved in how many people have left than there has been strong emotion, including anger at Cuba's economic deterioration and impatience to get on with what everyone knows is a perilous journey.   [ Despite the ample evidence that the number of Cubans leaving was rising sharply, relatively few were picked up by the Coast Guard. As of 10 P.M. Monday, 253 Cubans had been intercepted, up from 84 on Sunday. Last week, in the first rush, the Coast Guard picked up 13,600. ]   ""Tell my mother that I have gone and that I am very happy,"" Marbel Betancourt Gonzalez said just before she jumped into the turquoise waters of Cojimar to scramble onto a rubber and wooden raft with 10 others. Miss Betancourt, who had slept on the beach for nine days waiting for her journey, turned to face the crowd of hundreds of people piled on a crumbling sea wall, and with tears in her eyes she waved and blew kisses.   It is impossible to predict how many Cubans will leave in this wave, but today's activity indicates that the United States policy to deny them automatic asylum will not keep many people at home.   In fact, some of the Cubans say there is an urgency about leaving now.   Two brothers, Felipe and Jesus, came from Pinar del Rio, about 125 miles west of Cojimar, to leave from Cuba in a boat that they had assembled by soldering together pieces of aluminum, then painting it over with tar and padding the inside with plastic foam.   ""We're afraid Mr. Castro is going to say, 'No more,' so we have to leave now,"" Jesus said. ""We came here because this is the closest point to the United States, and it is a good place to launch a boat.""   The brothers also said that on their stretch of the coast the Government's coast guards still seemed to be patrolling the waters. At Cojimar, there were only a few soldiers in camouflage uniforms, and they did not seem to bother the people leaving. First Boat Leaves    The first boat to leave this morning from Cojimar was a tidy contraption of rubber and wood. It, too, had come on a truck, and it had a wooden rudder and a bow made of aluminum, with lines of thin rope on its perimeter for its passengers to hold onto and a jaunty red yachting flag atop its rough-hewn mast.   One by one people boarded the boat, as hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the littered beach to see them off. A festive atmosphere pervailed. Vendors were selling tamales and guanabo turnovers. The only ones not laughing were the six women and nine men who pushed off, rowing at the direction of an older man who was clearly their captain.   Some people were dispensing advice. One man told a would-be refugee how to judge how far his raft was from tankers that navigate the straits. He told him to hold his hand out in front of him in a fist, with his thumb sticking skyward, and to close one eye. ""If your thumb covers the whole tanker, then he's 10 miles away,"" the older man told the younger one.    Some carried good-luck charms on board. One boat had the Virgin of Charity on its bow. One refugee tried to take his dog on the raft, but the animal ran down a dock away from him.    Ramon Perez Lara, who is 61, was at the beach helping his son Sergio, who would be making about his 30th attempt to leave. The two men personify the debate about whether it is better to abandon Cuba or to stay and make it better.    Mr. Perez fought in the revolution. His family grew tobacco and corn on their small parcel of land, but the inequities of life before Castro's rule left the countryside poor of many things Cubans now have, he said.    ""I learned to read and write after the revolution,"" he said proudly.    But his son, Sergio Lara Caras, has felt let down by the revolution. He made his first attempt to try to leave Cuba on a home-made boat five years ago, when he was 29, and he has been trying ever since. Twice he was picked up by Soviet tankers and turned over to the Cuban authorities.   He has been in prison three times for his so-called treasonous crimes, and has served as long as eight months. He has gotten as far as 35 miles out to sea, far short of the 90 miles to Florida.    ""Castro has turned my struggle into something political by saying I am betraying the country,"" Mr. Lara said. ""But it is only economic. This country does not have opportunities for me anymore. Because I have been arrested for trying to leave, I cannot get the kind of work that will help me have a life.""   With tears streaming down her face, Berta Serrano Belot waved from the beach to a raft carrying her oldest daughter, 30, and her youngest son, 18.    ""For a mother this is the biggest pain in my entire life, to see my children leaving,"" said Mrs. Serrano, holding a granddaughter's hand.    Another daughter's husband was also on the boat, along with others from their town of San Miguel del Padron, about a three-hour bus ride from here. They had come to Cojimar as a family 12 days ago, and had camped on the beach.    They spent their days scavenging for bits of lumber and other material to build their boat. They bought what they needed with the money they got from selling many of their possessions back home. They had only a few pesos each day to buy bread.    But finally today, those who wanted to go were on their way.    ""I never thought my children would abandon me, but the ruin this country has fallen into has created such misery and hunger that it has forced them to go,"" Mrs. Serrano said, her voice trembling."

Mr. Kawamoto said the move would be taken as part of a broad effort to strengthen its car line in the next two years. Honda would continue to produce the station wagons at its Marysville, Ohio, plant for export to Europe and Japan, where most of them are sold. The wagon is not popular in the United States, Mr. Kawamoto said, so the new, Japanese-built mini-van that Honda plans to sell here next year may replace it in American dealerships. Honda sells about 30,000 Accord station wagons annually in the United States; it exports 40,000, mostly to Japan."

It was the Saturday morning after Fox Television made its first test run as a broadcaster of professional football, a preseason National Football League game in San Francisco last month.   In his Hollywood office, Mr. Hill, the president of Fox Sports, was recovering from the effort and ruminating over the performance.   ""I'm exhausted,"" he said. ""No one breathed for the first 20 minutes. Couldn't relax until the end credits ran. But we overcame any vestige of doubt that Fox could do football.""   An official for a rival network called to say the game's rating was disappointing, that the baseball strike and Fox's months of tireless promotion should have caused a stampede to the fledgling network.   ""Hell, it was awesome!"" Mr. Hill shouts. ""First time out? Fox had never done football before? Awesome!""   Ever since Rupert Murdoch bid a breathtaking $1.58 billion last December for the television rights to the National Football Conference for the next four years, Mr. Hill has been scrambling to build a sports broadcasting division from scratch. The eccentric, 48-year-old Australian is an unqualified cheerleader for the start-up, usually brimming with bravado. But Mr. Hill has his moments of doubt. He has been spotted in his office, his head in his hands, and muttering, ""I'm bleeping scared.""   ""I have great mood swings,"" Mr. Hill conceded. ""I wake up a lot at 4 in the morning with a lot on my mind.""   He should have a lot on his mind. It is up to Mr. Hill to make good on Mr. Murdoch's billion-dollar-plus gamble, one the biggest bets in the recent history of television. For Mr. Hill, as for the on-the-field quarterbacks like Troy Aikman and Randall Cunningham, the real season begins today. The network starts at noon with its one-hour ""Fox N.F.L. Sunday"" pregame studio show, then six games including the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys playing the Pittsburgh Steelers.   For Fox, there is far more at stake than simply success or failure in football. It is a big step into the mass-market mainstream for the seven-year-old Fox Television Network, which has attracted youthful audiences with programs like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Melrose Place.""   Featuring big-name N.F.C. teams from major metropolitan markets -- the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers, Washington Redskins, Chicago Bears and others -- will attract new viewers to Fox, well beyond fans of Bart Simpson and Heather Locklear.   Football is a crucial part of the audience-building drive at Fox, but there are others. After Fox outbid CBS for television rights to the N.F.C. -- NBC has the rights to the N.F.L.'s American Football Conference games, while ABC has Monday night games -- Mr. Murdoch invested $500 million for 20 percent of New World Communications. That deal will permit Fox to switch from weaker UHF stations in 12 cities to stronger VHF stations, including markets where it now has football rights like Detroit, Dallas and Atlanta. Eight of the 12 new stations Fox is picking up were CBS affiliates.   Football, then, is a means to Mr. Murdoch's larger agenda at Fox -- enhancing its brand recognition, increasing the value of Fox stations and broadening the network's reach to the nearly 100 percent of American TV households touched by ABC, CBS and NBC. Today, Fox is available in 98.6 percent of all television households. Pro football should do a lot to bridge Fox's fourth-network credibility gap.   It is only as a long-term investment to build the Fox franchise that the $1.58 billion Mr. Murdoch is paying for football television rights makes sense. He is, after all, spending 49 percent more than CBS paid for the previous four years. When the rights charges of $395 million a year are added to the operating costs for football programming, estimated at $100 million to $150 million annually, nobody expects Fox to make a profit on its four-year deal.   Mr. Murdoch seems to regard questions about the pricetag as quibbling. ""Did we overpay?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Of course we did.""   Fox Sports will be the most scrutinized sports start-up ever. ESPN, the last major TV sports kickoff, began in 1979 with a slow-pitch softball game. But Mr. Murdoch doesn't believe in half measures. ""We needed something people would come looking for,"" said Mr. Murdoch, who is now eyeing the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and baseball. ""We could have started with minor sports, but no one would have paid notice.""   The established networks all built up their sports divisions gradually. When football began on CBS in 1956, the network paid teams separate fees, and there was no complete N.F.L. network package. William MacPhail, a former vice president of CBS Sports, recalls paying the Green Bay Packers $31,000 one year. In 1962, CBS struck its first network deal with the N.F.L. for $4.7 million.   The times, and the stakes, have certainly changed. Even if Mr. Murdoch's move into pro football is less about profit than a patient bet to build Fox, the goal is still to attract audiences and limit the losses. Analysts expect Fox Sports to lose hundreds of millions of dollars over the next four years as advertising is unable to keep up with costs, because Mr. Murdoch paid the N.F.L. so much for the rights. Still, the financial difference between success and failure could be sizable, and a real worry for the shareholders of the News Corporation, Fox's parent company, if things go poorly.   ""For a company like Fox to try to create a brand, using clearly definable programming like the N.F.L. makes great strategic sense,"" said Christopher Dixon, an analyst for Paine Webber. ""The question is at what cost. The jury will be out on that question until the end of the season.""   Mr. Hill is the man in charge of managing this enormous financial bet. At first glance, he seems an unnerving choice. ""I'm a financial illiterate,"" he cheerfully confesses, while eating an onion and cheese sandwich in his office.    His manner and personality bear little resemblance to the serious, deal-making executives who tend to head the sports divisions of other networks. On airplane trips, he plays the Tetris video game on his Nintendo Game Boy. He licks a male publicist on an earlobe to reward a suggestion. A man of eclectic interests, he is learning Yiddish expressions. So he has taken to scribbling newly learned Yiddish words on the back of his appointment book: ""nebbish,"" ""schmear"" and ""mensch.""   Mr. Hill's notion of a business night out in Chicago recently was to take his staff to a blues bar, where he gushed over legendary guitarist Buddy Guy, who owns the place. A devoted surfer, Mr. Hill loves Bruce Brown's 1966 cult documentary about surfers, ""The Endless Summer,"" and he attended the premiere of its sequel this year. His daughter Anne's birth announcement in June was accompanied by a quotation from Martin Farquhar Tupper, a 19th century English writer.   Mr. Hill's philosophy for success in sports programming is simple: be generous in signing up name-brand talent and make sure the production is slick and cutting-edge. Audience ratings and revenues, he figures, will follow. ""As much a business dyslexic as I am, I know that,"" he said.   He has spared little expense in hiring well-known football commentators and personalities. Fox is paying John Madden, football's manic Rabelaisian wit, a total of $30 million for four years, making him the highest paid man, on the field or behind a microphone, in the sport. Pat Summerall, Mr. Madden's longtime partner at CBS, will get $1.5 million a year. Terry Bradshaw, the former star quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, will collect $1.75 million annually from Fox. A sportscasting newcomer, Jimmy Johnson, who left as coach of the Cowboys last year, after winning two Super Bowls, has been signed up for $600,000 a year.   BESIDES high-priced on-the-air talent, Fox is banking on the sports programming instincts of Mr. Hill. First in Australia, and later for Mr. Murdoch's Sky Television in Britain, Mr. Hill adapted the tools of American sports TV by using more cameras in more locations, instant replays, enhanced graphics and flashier analyst commentary. For coverage of the America's Cup yacht races in 1987 in Australia -- ""little triangles on blue water,"" he calls it -- he put tiny cameras aboard yachts for close-up coverage.   ""I saw a guy who cared absolutely nothing about boating bring that event alive,"" said Geoff Mason, the former executive producer of ABC Sports.   In 1988, Mr. Murdoch hired Mr. Hill away from the rival Nine Network, owned by another Australian entrepreneur, Kerry Packer. ""The Nine Network was always our competition, and Hill was a legendary figure in Sydney,"" Mr. Murdoch recalled. The Hill reputation was based largely on using American sports programming techniques to alter the look and quicken the pace of soccer, cricket, yachting and auto racing.   MR. MURDOCH liked Mr. Hill's work in Australia so much that he soon gave Mr. Hill two sports start-ups in Europe to direct: Eurosport, a pan-European cable sports service, much like ESPN, which Mr. Murdoch eventually sold, and Sky Sports, a fast-growing British network for satellite dish owners.   What Mr. Hill did to cricket programming, first in Australia, and then in Britain, is typical of his approach. The sport of flat bats, white pullover sweaters and tea breaks is decidedly slow-moving -- so much so that cricket's detractors say that you can gain weight while playing the sport. Mr. Hill abhors boredom, and he was committed to accelerating the pace of cricket, at least for television viewers. A smile comes over Mr. Hill's ruddy face, topped by bushy white curls, when he describes the changes he made and the mixed reaction to his innovations in presenting the tradition-steeped sport.   With a black marker, Mr. Hill sketches a circular cricket field with two triangles on top to depict the conventional locations of television cameras, behind the batsmen (hitter) and facing the bowler (pitcher).   ""Cricket was always covered from one end, so the bowler bowls from one end, and all you'd see is the batsman's butt,"" Mr. Hill recalled. ""That was stupid, so we put cameras at the other end as well . . . This was regarded as the end of civilization.""   Then came the duck. Mr. Hill ordained that an animated duck waddle across the TV screen when a batsman whiffed to illustrate the term, ""out for a duck."" The first time he used the duck animation, Mr. Hill did not give any advance warning to the commentator, who had once captained the Australian national team. When he saw it, the ex-cricket star, with voice shaking, said, ""It's obvious David Hill never played cricket!""   And Ian Woolridge, sports columnist for The Daily Mail of London, said, ""Bloody ducks ruined cricket for me. Hilly is totally, absolutely mad. Bonkers -- with a 10-dimensional mind.""   Paul Fox, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph of London, observed, ""Hill changed cricket beyond all recognition.""   WHEN Sky Sports acquired Premier League English soccer, Mr. Hill dubbed the weekly presentation ""Monday Night Football"" as homage to the long-running ABC series created by his idol, Roone Arledge, the sports-programming impresario who started ABC's long-running weekly football game broadcast.   But does Mr. Hill know American football? Mr. Hill pondered the question one June evening in the backyard of a rented Brentwood house he shares with his third wife, Joan, and their infant daughter, Anne.   ""How much do I know about football?"" he asked aloud.   ""He doesn't know much,"" said Barry Frank, Madden's agent. ""I'm not sure if he'll know if some of the people he's hired are good or not.""   ""He's absorbed the visceral element,"" said Tim Green, a neophyte Fox analyst. ""Now he's working his way outward on the technical aspects.""   Mr. Hill's football I.Q. is good, not great. He knows big names, big plays. He loves the hitting, the sounds, the drama, the quick turnarounds in fortune. He knows Emmitt Smith, the Dallas Cowboys running back, from Emmett Kelly, the famed sad-faced circus clown.   Yet Mr. Hill, colleagues say, favors a wide open and loose management style, so Fox Sports is not depending on his grasp of American football minutiae. Although he is a protean chatterer -- a ""human filibuster,"" his friend, film director Peter Faiman, says -- he listens well, and gives his executives extensive free reign.   THE lavish start-up means satisfying the wish lists of defectors from other networks. Sandy Grossman, Mr. Madden's CBS director, will present Fox games with 12 cameras, four more than he had at CBS.    Mr. Hill's core group has worked merciless hours, and many are smoking so much it seems that Marlboro has bought a sponsorship at Fox Sports. Rick Dovey, Mr. Hill's chief of staff at Sky Sports, said that pace is nothing new: ""It was easy to work for Hill as long as you wanted to work 100 hours a week. He doesn't organize well but picks people to put his vision into effect.""   Most importantly, Mr. Hill has satisfied Mr. Madden, a 21st-round draft choice of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1958, who is now the highest paid man -- the Cowboys' quarterback Troy Aikman is next, averaging $6.25 million a year -- in all of football. Mr. Madden refused Capital Cities/ABC and General Electric's NBC, whose offer included a G.E. train to travel to games.    MR. MADDEN is the totem for Fox Sports. He's in the most promotional spots. He was host of one of Fox's pre-season specials. He adorned the cover of TV Guide. He will call virtually every important game, including the 1997 Super Bowl. He is a happy man, for aside from his hardware, shoe, video game and athlete's foot spray endorsements, Mr. Madden is consumed by football. So, for now, is Fox.   ""They'll listen to anything,"" Mr. Madden said. ""At CBS, we'd do some of my ideas and not others. Anything I've thought we ought to do at CBS, we'll do at Fox. It's selfish, but Fox Sports is only football.""   If Fox's game telecasts match the quality attained by Madden & Company at CBS, Mr. Hill will be satisfied. That will be a big challenge given the intricate choreography required of American football programming with its constant replays, instant on-screen diagrams of plays and cutting from one camera to another. And behind Fox Sports's big-name stars are a corps of low-priced, mainly young announcers who have called few if any football games.   Besides the additional on-field cameras, Fox Sports is changing the weekly pregame schedule with an hour-long studio show, compared with CBS's 30-minute program, ""The N.F.L. Today.""   Fox, by all accounts, faces a huge challenge in trying to attract a football audience as large as CBS had, given the smaller network's more limited reach. But Mr. Hill's staff is not conceding any losses yet. ""Say we get 90 percent of the CBS football audience,"" said Tracy Dolgin, executive vice president of marketing. ""I have to get 10 percent percent back. If I don't, I'll hold a gun to my head -- after I'm fired.""   Still, the top Fox executives are more concerned with using football to build the network's franchise than with this season's audience ratings. ""We'll build our coverage, strengthen our affiliates and increase revenues year after year,"" said Chase Carey, the chairman of Fox Television. ""No question that after four years, the N.F.C. deal will be materially profitable for us.""   Mr. Hill obviously hopes so. But he also has to worry week to week. Before the kickoff today, he seemed to be suffering from some preseason jitters, his moods swinging between confidence and anxiety.   In a self-assured moment, he said, ""In reality, this isn't so hard. If you never think you can fail, you probably won't.""   Yet later, Mr. Hill ruefully joked, ""What's that the captain of the Titantic said? 'How's it going? Fine!' "" David Hill  Current position: President of Fox Sports.

Beneficiary  Q. When a spouse is the beneficiary of an I.R.A., can the spouse add a child as beneficiary after the account owner dies?  MILTON GREENWOOD, Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.  A. As the beneficiary of an individual retirement account, a spouse can either receive distributions or roll over the account into another I.R.A.   If the account is rolled over into the name of the surviving spouse, it is considered a new I.R.A. The spouse can then name a beneficiary, which may be a child or grandchild.   If a younger person is named as beneficiary, minimum distributions can be stretched out by using the combined life expectancies of the account holder and the beneficiary.   ""During the surviving spouse's lifetime, there is a special rule that limits to a maximum of 10 years the age difference that may be taken into account in the joint and last survivor life expectancy calculation,"" said Jeffrey L. Keyser of Deloitte & Touche. ""So if the surviving spouse is age 70 1/2 and the designated beneficiary is age 40, the lives for purposes of determining minimum distributions would be 70 1/2 and 60 1/2.""   Evaluating Annuities  Q. What sources evaluate variable annuities? JOYCE FISCHMAN, Norwalk, Conn.  A. There are almost 300 variable annuities and a much larger number of fund subaccounts, or possible investments, from which investors can choose. Information is provided by Morningstar, Lipper Analytical Services and the Variable Annuity Research and Data Service, among others. Performance data and fee comparisons are also published periodically in some newspapers and magazines.   ""Investors should look significantly beyond performance data when considering variable annuity products,"" cautioned Kurt Cerulli, a Boston consultant. ""Consider whether the contract has a guaranteed death benefit, the ease of moving money among subaccounts, minimum guarantees on fixed accounts and withdrawal waiting periods.""   Price-Earnings Ratio  Q. What is a price-earnings ratio?  JOHN J. HOWLEY, Rockaway Park, Queens  A. A price-earnings ratio, or P/E, gauges how  expensive a stock price is relative to a company's earnings per share. In general, lower P/E ratios are considered better than high ratios.   The traditional way to calculate P/E ratios, the one used in newspaper stock tables, is the trailing earnings method, in which the current price of one share of stock is divided by the company's earnings per share over the last four quarters. The alternative method is to divide the price by the earnings per share projected by analysts for the next four quarters.   ""The ironic thing regarding P/E ratios is that the trailing earnings method actually works quite well,"" said Richard Bernstein of Merrill Lynch. ""Stock-picking methods based on P/E ratios tend to underperform during recessions, because out-of-favor stocks usually become even more out-of-favor during bad economic times."""

Last week the City of Las Cruces, N.M., voted to replace El Paso with a citizen-owned utility. Other problems at El Paso include the possible loss of contracts to supply power to Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range; cracks in steam generator tubes at the Palo Verde nuclear plant, and regulatory opposition to several rate increases.   A failed merger would dash El Paso Electric's hopes of emerging from bankruptcy. In January 1992, it became only the second American utility to seek bankruptcy protection since the Depression."

Government officials and analysts here said that while the accord could defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula, it might end up being only another in a series of seemingly promising agreements made by North Korea that are never carried out. The South Koreans also said the agreement in Geneva failed to explicitly address one of South Korea's central concerns: that there be inspections of nuclear sites in North Korea in an attempt to determine whether it already has nuclear weapons."

In May, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released guidelines it says were designed to help employers fulfill the goal of the legislation. The E.E.O.C.'s underlying principle, too, seems simple enough: Employers may not ask questions of job applicants that might lead to disclosure of a disability before an offer is made, on the theory that such disclosures would muddy hiring decisions with prejudices and stereotypes.   In fact, with a little professional guidance on the guidelines -- available from the commission -- it is not impossible to figure out what is permissible and what is not, presumably a bit of welcome news for the increasing numbers of businesses covered by the measure. In late July, coverage expanded to businesses with 15 or more employees."

The acquisition of Neutrogena, which makes premium brand health care products for women, reflects the continuing consolidation of consumer products into the hands of companies with strong international distribution systems, analysts said. Last month, for example, Avon sold Giorgio Beverly Hills to Procter & Gamble in order to concentrate on its core cosmetics business. P.& G. has been building its international fragrance business since 1991, when it purchased Max Factor from Revlon. Overseas Opportunities    For Johnson & Johnson, overseas opportunities are among Neutrogena's biggest draws. Only about a fourth, or $72 million, of Neutrogena's $307 million in projected sales this year will come from abroad, according to Diana Temple, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. That is much less than at other personal care products companies. Avon and Gillette, for instance, each derive about two-thirds of their sales overseas, she said."

Last week came word of a surprise surge in payrolls in June -- 379,000 jobs added -- as the unemployment rate held steady at 6 percent. On top of that, new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 21,000, to 332,000, the largest drop since April and the lowest level since March. Of course, as always, statistics can fib a little. After a winter laden with snow days, for example, schools had to stay open longer, keeping school workers on the payroll. But, mainly, more jobs are appearing. And, yes, more jobs equals inflation scare equals rising interest rates. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to its highest level since Nov. 9, 1992, the week of the Presidential election. But for President Clinton, the point was this: ""We have still Americans who need jobs, we have still Americans who are working part time who wish to work full time."" News From the Fed: No News One on important front, nothing happened last week -- and that nonevent was big news. Whenever Federal Reserve policy makers sit down to meet, the financial markets hold their collective breath, waiting to see if the central bank will tighten the screws a bit more by raising short-term rates. But after this meeting, the Fed said nothing, which observers took to mean the Fed had not acted. Of course, just because after recent meetings the Fed has gone public with its decisions doesn't mean it's still doing so. Many people still expect the Fed to act sometime this summer, and the latest job numbers could give them the final nudge. Bretton Woods It's Not  When, exactly 50 years ago, world leaders met in Bretton Woods, N.H., they faced grand challenges: a world to rebuild, a global monetary system to reinvent. But as this weekend's summit meeting began in Naples, world leaders tiptoed around the currency question. The big industrial economies are doing just fine, but global bond and currency markets are already on edge -- so don't rock the boat. When President Clinton tried his own brand of tiptoeing, though -- saying he opposed propping up the dollar, not wanting to ""choke off growth"" worldwide -- currency traders, sure enough, took the cue and sent the dollar near its all-time low. Tally of Smoking's Health Costs  There are numerous ways of measuring the health costs of smoking -- with the tobacco industry, of course, at one extreme, often saying there's no cost at all because smoking isn't dangerous. And last week a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came out with a novel statistic: for each pack of cigarettes smoked, the taxpayer pays an 89-cent medical bill. Here's how that works out, according to its survey: health care for smoking-related illnesses cost at least $50 billion in 1993 (that represents fully 7 percent of the nation's total health costs), and Federal and state Governments pay 43 percent of that. So of a total health cost of $2.06 a pack, the taxpayer pays 89 cents. Trump Tower South?  Once again, Donald Trump is out to spiff up the neighborhood. Last week he said he'd become part owner of a certain Midtown office tower and immediately vowed to restore it to ""its rightful position as a world-class real estate asset."" That surely noble sentiment, though, was not greeted warmly by Peter Malkin, who's had partial control of the building and who was quick to voice his feeling that ""it is a world-class real estate asset."" Granted, it's no Trump Tower, but you still may have heard of it: it's called the Empire State Building. And Mr. Trump, it seems, now owns half of it -- without having spent a penny. He managed that by helping the buyers -- European and Asian investors -- arrange financing. Now, Where Were Those Bonds?  In the beginning there was cash -- well, O.K., beads or shells or even salt. But then came all this high-tech stuff, with banks zinging money mysteriously through the ether. What keeps them from losing a million here, a million there, through a hole in some electronic pocket? The answer: sometimes they do. Seattle First National Bank just settled with the S.E.C. and the Comptroller's office, paying a $75,000 penalty, after it simply lost track of $3 million in bonds. After the bank switched to a computerized system of handling bonds, the S.E.C. said, inadequately trained workers from a temp agency were handling things, and the bonds fell through the cracks. And who found them? The F.B.I., which bought them after they'd been stolen in transit. ""This was a glitch in the extreme,"" said one official. COMPANIES New York, on the Savings Map  When you think savings giants, you think California, a land with two mortgages in every garage. The biggest guns are there -- Ahmanson, Great Western, Golden West. In New York, mega-banking generally means catering to the affluent, who want to move money at the flick of a computer. But suddenly, rising in the East, is a savings giant. Last week Dime and Anchor, two pillars of traditional mortgage lending, said they'd merge, with the combined company vaulting to No. 4 among savings banks. The new name: Dime Bancorp (a survey showed that Dime, born in 1852, is better known). At its head: Richard Parsons, Dime's chairman and a rising industry star. Bond Shopping at Macy's  Macy's owes bondholders $1.3 billion it can't pay, and that gives bondholders a big say in Macy's fate as it tries to climb out of bankruptcy. So far bondholders have stymied an attempt by Federated to merge with Macy's, but that could change soon. Fidelity, the mutual fund powerhouse, which backs the merger, decided that if it couldn't fight the bondholders, it would join them -- in a big way. Last week Fidelity bought $80 million worth of the bonds -- not enough to dictate Macy's fate, but enough to make itself heard. Texaco Pulls Up Some Stakes  American oil companies have had it with America. Environmental concerns put many areas off limits, and many oil fields are past their glory days, so they're increasingly looking abroad. And of course, like all good corporate citizens these days, they're trying to be stingy with costs. Texaco fit right in with both trends last week when it said it would sell half its 600 producing domestic fields and cut 2,500 jobs. Soon, it says, its balance will tilt, putting more of its spending abroad. And Texaco says it plans to keep cutting overhead.  A Crowded Exit at Fox  As Fox moves steadily toward television's big leagues, it's endured some highly visible growing pains -- perhaps because Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox, has been taking a special interest in it lately. Two years ago Barry Diller left as head of Fox Inc., beginning his detour in home-shopping land at QVC en route to CBS. More departures followed, with the latest coming last week, when Lucie Salhany, network television's highest-ranking woman, resigned from Fox Broadcasting after a reshuffling wiped out her position as chairwoman. Her tenure was marked by ups and downs, with one memorable down being her bet on Chevy Chase as Fox's great late-night hope. INTERNATIONAL French Business on Trial  These haven't been good times for French business, with accusations flying about corruption at the very top and fraud charges against various executives. Last week brought a vivid episode in this drama, as Pierre Suard, head of Alcatel, the telecommunications and engineering giant, was arrested for questioning about possible misuse of company funds -- investigators say he used $740,000 of shareholders' money on a security system for his apartment. Alcatel has just agreed to pay France Telecom $11 million to settle charges of overbilling and two Alcatel managers were convicted of fraud.  An Argentine Miracle (for Some)  Latin America is a volatile economic laboratory, its nations lunging from system to system. A world-minded capitalism has won many a recent tug-of-war, but the cost is often high. In Argentina, President Menem's Government has wrestled inflation down from a numbing 5,000 percent in 1989 to under 5 percent, becoming a model economy-in-training. But left behind, critics say, are the rural poor. And last week, with unemployment rising and rich and poor drifting further apart, tens of thousands of out-of-town Argentines descended on Buenos Aires to protest economic policies. Said one member of Congress: ""The Government cannot ignore this."""

Tea-leaf readers make great sport of divining just what led to such a resignation even at ho-hum companies. But when the resignation is ""personal"" and the company is this year's candidate for Most Likely to Blunder, it's all the more fun to take a peek at the business dealings of the exiting executive.   Spectrum Information Technologies Inc. said earlier this month that Dennis R. Williamson had resigned from its board of directors for ""personal reasons."" No further explanation was forthcoming. But Mr. Williamson, with only three weeks as a board member under his belt, hardly needed an excuse in his personal life to be abandoning the board of a company with little room for more bad publicity. Creative Resources Inc., the public company for which Mr. Williamson works as president and C.E.O., is enough of an eyebrow-raiser on its own to beg the question of why Spectrum took him on in the first place."

But the derivatives debacle is just another symptom of a much larger and simpler problem that has long plagued the mutual fund business and seems to be getting worse, a problem that over time is likely to hurt more Americans than derivatives ever will.   The problem is that intense competition among fund companies and their need to sell, sell, sell often comes into conflict with good, safe investment practices. So the fund companies turn to risky strategies and untried investment gimmicks, which can backfire. It happened a decade ago with so-called option-income funds, bond funds that wrote up options to generate income but instead led to big losses. It happened two years ago in short-term world income funds. And it is happening now, some analysts say, in bond funds like Paine Webber's."

That is probably the real meaning of the bulge in business inventories that has left economists shaking their heads, and that on Friday sent bond prices soaring.   "

Arthur E. Reiner, who many had expected to help command the thorny consolidation of the two companies' New York area chains became the first senior Macy executive to publicly announce his departure. Mr. Reiner, a courtly merchant who survived a decade of corporate turmoil at R. H. Macy & Company, said yesterday that he would leave the company on Oct. 14."

Biggs predicts market booms and busts around the globe. Sometimes he even causes them.   Mr. Biggs, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, is one of the most venerable seers on Wall Street. If he says, as he has in recent years, ""Put money in emerging markets,"" plenty of institutional investors do so -- and a boom is born."

While people can still get utilities' customary slow, sure amble to high dividends, looming competition in the industry means investors may have a different ride altogether.   True, the nation's 100 electric utilities, hammered by interest rate rises, were off nearly 28 percent in early July from a year ago. And true, bargain hunters have since bid them back up, just a bit. No surprises there. Although safe in many ways, utilities have always had interest-rate risk."

Trouble is probably ahead. For when investors get that enthusiastic, they usually overdo it.   The latest test for the theory comes in the planned union of CBS, the proud proprietor of the highest rated television network, with QVC Network, cable television's second most successful peddler of cubic zirconia jewelry. On the news, QVC stock leaped 17 percent, and CBS added 19 percent."

The flight mechanics are objecting to a new work schedule that they say will cause them to work as many as 120 extra hours each year. The strike grounded 80 flights on Sunday and caused delays of up to four hours.
