Medvedev, the deputy director of Gazprom, has floated the idea of allowing foreign energy companies to take an equity stake in an operating company that will develop a large offshore natural gas field in the Russian Arctic. Mr. Medvedev’s comments suggest a softening of the Russian monopoly’s position on the Shtokman field, which could be used to supply liquefied natural gas to Europe and the East Coast of the United States. Last October, Gazprom froze talks with five foreign companies seeking a role in the project and said it would develop the field alone. Now the Norwegian companies Statoil and Norsk Hydro, which are merging into one company, Total of France and ConocoPhillips of the United States are negotiating for a role in the development. In an interview with The Financial Times, Mr. Medvedev’s suggestion that a “new model” of cooperation could be found for the big field holds the potential to ease tense relations between Russia and Western energy majors. Gazprom lacks the offshore technology to develop the field alone, industry analysts say."
