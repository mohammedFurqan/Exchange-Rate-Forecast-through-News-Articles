Separately, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Woodward disclosed that Taubman Holdings had granted to three of Woodward's top officials options to buy about 20 percent of the company for about $5 million if the merger was completed. Based on the Taubman offer, 20 percent of the company would be worth at least $40 million."

The decline in the gauge, the index of leading economic indicators, broke an 18-month string of monthly increases, the longest since World War II. It was the sort of shift that can portend the onset of a recession.   However, both private and Administration analysts were quick to insist that the economy was merely moderating, not declining. They said the index simply confirmed what many other reports had suggested of late - that the economy was slowing to a pace that was normal after the initial rush of recovery from a recession."

It was a further sign of widening differences between the Reagan Administration and Walter F.

''I think they do threaten to put inflationary pressures into wage-setting in the auto industry, and I think it's about time we think about getting rid of those quotas.'' By contrast, Mr. Mondale has endorsed a House-passed ''domestic content'' bill, supported by the United Auto Workers. With this bill, up to 90 percent of the material and labor content of cars sold in the United States would be required to come from the United States."

Housing starts, which plunged in March, gained 19.3 percent in April, and were running at an annual rate of 1.96 million units. Although that pace probably cannot be sustained in the face of rising interest rates, total housing starts are expected to exceed 1.8 million this year. Personal income rose five-tenths of 1 percent, but personal spending jumped, indicating more confidence in the recovery. Industrial production rose 1.4 percent, three times the March rise, and factory utilization jumped to 81.9 percent.    The healthy numbers bolstered predictions that the second quarter will be another sizzler. Gloomy outlooks of a 3 to 4 percent annual-rate increase are being replaced by predictions of a growth rivaling the expansion in the first quarter, which was revised to an robust 8.8 percent. But, as always, caution lurked behind the optimism: a high growth rate in the second quarter is almost sure to indicate expansion that borders on the uncontrolled."

To defend democracy we must do more than simply fight Communist guerrillas and death squads, we must also fight injustice, inequality, poverty and ignorance. These are threats equally dangerous.   We call upon the United States to join in our efforts and the glory of success. We the Salvadorans are going to do our best. But if together we fail to defend and preserve democracy in El Salvador, we will also share the consequences of defeat. If the Soviets, the Cubans and the Sandinistas succeed in reversing our achievements and prevent us from restoring the people's full rights, then the challenge will have to be faced by the United States alone, because you may be certain that we, the Salvadoran people on the front lines of the fight for freedom today, will not be here to help you.

Some American officials, who acknowledge that they may be overly optimistic, contend that the Iranians will probably launch a less than all-out attack, and that once a new stalemate develops they will finally agree to discuss terms for ending the war, which Iraq started nearly four years ago.   Khomeini Said to Back Fight    In this view, which is shared by some European intelligence officials, the main force for continuing the war is Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian spiritual and political leader.

The young Americans, whose fathers or grandfathers emigrated from the Middle East, are choosing to take a year or so away from their studies and spend it here, living with Arab families in East Jerusalem, in Galilee or in the occupied West Bank in an effort to learn the politics of the conflict and to absorb the culture and language of their forebears.   There are no statistics on how many have come this way, but they appear mainly to be young men in their 20's who are doing graduate work in Middle Eastern studies. For many, the experience has engaged their pro-Palestinian political sympathies, but it has also reinforced the American side of their dual identities, showing them how steeped they are in American values and how far they stand from Arab society."

A reinvigorated Chrysler reinstated its quarterly payout, American Telephone and Telegraph threatened to cut its dividend for the first time ever, two big utilities - Long Island Lighting and Public Service of New Hampshire - halted their common stock dividends, and just last week, General Motors surprised Wall Street by raising its quarterly payout by 25 percent.     But whether dividends are actually good for shareholders is not altogether clear. While some old-line companies, such as General Electric, have paid dividends for years, rapid-growth, high- tech concerns, such as Apple Computer, often do not pay dividends at all. Nor is the meaning of dividend changes easy to decipher."

Royal Dutch has cautioned them in a telephone campaign that $58 is the best it will offer for at least 18 months and that, once the offer expires, the stock could go back to its previous $40 price.    But under a court order expected to be issued today in a class-action suit by Shell stockholders, they would be given the opportunity to take back their shares. This would give investors another chance to decide what to do with their stock after Royal Dutch and its adviser, Morgan Stanley & Company, provide them with additional information about the value of the shares."

Mr. Banta, who has the poster taped to his office wall, does not yet have the answer to that question. But for AM, it is an old refrain. The darling of Wall Street analysts back when it was known as the Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation, AM has now come full circle.   The cycle began when former chairman Roy L. Ash tried to make AM grow by expanding from outdated office machines into high technology. That decision led to the staggering losses that the next two chairmen, Richard Black and Joe B.

''We were motivated solely by our concern for Argentina,'' Mr. Mulford said, and for other developing-country debtors.

Although the complete loss of the seven million barrels a day that flow through the Strait of Hormuz is regarded as unlikely, and four million barrels a day could quickly be made up by other producers, the situation is so volatile and uncertain that it has prompted the Reagan Administration and Congress to review the adequacy of preparedness plans.   So far, the intensified fighting in the gulf has caused virtually no reduction in the flow of oil to the West and Japan. The markets, with oil in abundant supply, have generally remained calm. Insurance premiums on cargoes and hulls have soared, but that has largely been offset by equivalent price-cutting by gulf producers eager to sell their oil."

A last-minute loan for $500 million, put together by United States officials, appeared imminent late Friday to save Argentina from becoming the first nation since the eruption of the foreign debt crisis to have its loans declared nonperforming. The emergency loan would allow Argentina to pay some of the $650 million in interest that must be paid by this weekend if United States banks are to avoid a sharp reduction in first-quarter earnings. In the talks leading up to the loan agreement on Friday, Argentina's blunt-talking Economics Minister, Bernardo Grinspun, said the banks' accounting problems were not his concern. His nation, now $47 billion in debt, has an estimated $1 billion in reserve, but Mr. Grinspun wants to use the funds at home, and put off payments on the nation's foreign debt until later in the spring, at the earliest.   The Bank of Boston said that if it had to declare its $100 million in loans to Argentina as nonperforming, its first-quarter earnings would suffer ''substantially.''"

Eisenhower's Administration in 1953 to use atomic bombs in North Korea and Communist China, if necessary, to end the Korean War.   Once the armistice was achieved, on July 27, 1953, the Eisenhower Administration continued to define plans to use nuclear weapons if the Communists renewed the war, which the North Koreans started in 1950.   President Eisenhower took office in January 1953 after talks for a cease-fire had dragged on for two years and the war had settled into a standoff, with casualties being incurred but with no change in the front line, which today still separates North and South Korea.   The fact that the Eisenhower Administration was ready to use nuclear weapons is not new.

Closely followed, but not always understood, these indicators - which are used to predict broad market movements on the basis of historic price and trading volume patterns - can prove frustratingly enigmatic. But a knowledge of what technical indicators are saying has proved a valuable resource to many investors, both large and small.    It requires a minor education to interpret the tea-leaf patterns of the technician's breadth-momentum indicators, sentiment indicators and monetary indicators, as well as a good Wall Street lexicon. The insider buy-sell ratio can seem to say something different than the Big Board specialist short sale ratio. The 10-day New York Stock Exchange volume index can appear to throw off different signals than the 30-day advance-decline ratio. But for those who believe in their prophetic wisdom, technical indicators almost always have a story to tell about the coming movement of stock prices."

In exchange, Public Serice will give the cooperative 38 mega-watts of power from its holdings in existing nuclear plants, probably Maine Yankee, a 12-year-old reactor in Wiscasset, Me.   This deal is in addition to the co-op's 2.2 percent ownership of Seabrook 1.

Despite Britain's tight laws preventing anyone who knew the secrets of the thriving textile mills from leaving the country, the 21-year-old apprentice in Richard Arkwright's Derbyshire mills disguised himself as a farmhand and, in 1789, dashed off to the United States. There he promptly re-created the Arkwright mill from memory and gave birth to the industry that was to nurture New England's economy for generations.   History does not record what his British bosses said, but the dismay they must have felt two centuries ago about the theft of their cloth-making secrets is a thoroughly modern phenomenon.

Hall of Cornell (''Oil Mergers: The Effect on Drilling,'' Letters, March 25) reminded this reader of the thinking that underpinned the ill-fated National Energy Plan I, first proposed in 1977. Arguments about finite oil and natural gas resources, running out of natural gas, a nuclear resurgence and the switch to electricity were the popular fads of the day. More realistic wellhead prices, the product of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, have demonstrated that this finite resource mentality is wrong. The gas resource base is for practical purposes finite only for a particular set of economic and technological assumptions. The essential point is that technology and economics are constantly changing."

You may think you've discovered that exotic little island, but chances are that intrepid representatives of American Express and Diners Club have already been there and signed up a host of local hotels, restaurants and merchants. And no matter how exotic the names of the local bank charge plans, if you look closely, you'll see familiar emblems indicating an affiliation with Visa or Mastercard. Carte Bleu in France and Barclaycard in Britain are both Visa affliliates, for example, while in much of Europe, Access and Eurocard are Mastercard affiliates."

The change - a minor revolution for the newspaper business - is the standardization of newspaper size and basic format so that the same advertisement will fit perfectly into newspapers from Maine to Hawaii.   The nation's newspapers have brought about this change in an unusual cooperative effort that has cost them collectively an estimated $750 million. But the publishers seem willing to invest even more money and cooperation in their drive to forge the nation's daily newspapers into a single vast network that can compete more effectively for advertising with mass mailers and television."

The seven town councilmen, five of whom are French Canadians, voted overwhelmingly early this month to ignore the order to remove the English words and to fight any fine in the courts. Their decision represents the newest serious challenge to Quebec's Charter of the French Language, a measure whose authority was somewhat eroded last week by a court ruling that allowed storekeepers to offer bilingual catalogues rather than the French-only brochures that the provincial government asserted were required by the charter."

Currently, despite general agreement that profits should show robust gains this year, analysts remain sharply divided on their advice to investors.    In a sense, the division boils down to this question: How much of the good news has already been discounted by the stock market?

The Euroyen Market    Effective Dec. 1, 1984, the number and types of issuers of Euroyen bonds will be expanded significantly with the result that any borrower meeting credit criteria can issue. Of particular importance is that non-Japanese corporations will for the first time be able to issue yen-denominated Eurobonds.   The credit criteria initially applied will parallel those in the Samurai market - that is, the domestic Japanese market for foreign yen bond issues. However, these credit criteria will be further liberalized from April 1, 1985, to permit any borrower rated AA or better as well as a reasonable portion of those world corporations that would be rated A to issue such bonds.  These corporations, as well as all other foreign issuers of Euroyen bonds, will face no restrictions on the number or size of issue, and will not be required to use the Samurai market as a prerequisite."

The slight drop in short- and long- term interest rates came after sharp increases earlier this week, leading some analysts to conclude that credit market participants might have overestimated the rapidity and degree to which the Fed was encouraging higher interest rates.   The absence of an increase in the discount rate, which the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions, was more responsible for the modest drop in rates yesterday than any revival of investor demand or change in the widespread perception that the Fed is tightening monetary policy and fostering higher interest rates.    The discount rate has been at 8 1/2 percent since December 1982, but many analysts expect an increase soon to bring it into closer alignment with other interest rates and to make it easier for the Fed to discourage banks and other institutions from borrowing at the window."

According to James Sottile, senior vice president of Citizen and a former Pulsar executive, the budget is more than the total of the company's ad spending up to now."

On the other hand, the British Government could expel any or all Libyan diplomats from its territory, close the embassy and prosecute any suspect who does not have diplomatic immunity, experts said.   In addition, the fact that the Libyan Embassy in London was taken over and its accredited diplomats were ejected by revolutionary students in February, without formal notification to the British authorities, could cast doubt on whether those now occupying the embassy were entitled to diplomatic immunity."

Mr. Volcker told a meeting of Princeton University alumni there were problems with some debtor nations, but the overall situation was manageable. ''I do not think it is possible to apply an across-the-board cure,'' he said, adding each debtor country needed individual attention."

Under a corporate buyback, a company uses its own money to repurchase part of its outstanding common stock when it considers such a move the best investment for its cash. A leveraged, or management, buyout has the effect of taking a publicly owned company private, with senior executives usually investing more heavily in their companies. These buyouts often utilize the corporate assets as collateral for loans to finance the purchase of at least a major part of the company's stock."

The final boost in prices followed the Fed's late afternoon announcement of a $3.3 billion increase in the nation's basic money supply for the week ended May 21.

A majority of the committee questioned the agency's accounting practices, including those used for some overhead and personnel costs that had not been charged against the $24 million statutory Congressional ceiling on covert operations in Nicaragua in the current fiscal year.   A key issue was the agency's financing of the mother ship in the mining of Nicaraguan harbors. The agency allocated $1 million of the $1.2 million cost to ''overhead.''

This unwritten assurance not only persuaded the five American and six foreign banks to participate in the overall $400 million package but also convinced them to lend at an extraordinarily low interest rate, the sources said.    They added that there was little risk for the Fed itself because it had been authorized by Argentina's central bank to debit Argentina's dollar account at the Fed at the end of June, when the banks are scheduled to be repaid. Argentina is reported to have about $1 billion in readily available foreign-exchange reserves and about $2 billion in such longer-term assets as gold."

While trade with Western Europe grew by 6.4 percent in 1983, Soviet exchanges with other industrial countries, notably Japan and the United States, declined by 16 percent.   This global shift in trading patterns is due in part to continued large Soviet sales of oil and natural gas, growing purchases of modern industrial technology and a decline in imports of grain.

It asserted that the Saudis needed the portable weapons immediately to help defend their shipping and oilfields against possible aerial attacks by Iran.   Israel quickly announced its opposition to the shipments, saying that the missiles could be readily shifted for use against them, and could possibly fall into the hands of terrorists."

First, Jacques de Larosi ere, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, let Mexico know that it would receive easier terms than other debtors as a reward for putting its economic house in order. Then Walter B. Wriston, chairman of Citicorp and a close adviser of President Reagan, let Brazil know that it, too, would receive favored treatment for its sacrifices.   At the London economic summit conference earlier this month, the leaders of the seven industrial countries endorsed these overtures to Mexico and Brazil by agreeing that ''in cases where debtor countries are themselves making successful efforts to improve their position,'' the summit countries would encourage ''more extended multiyear rescheduling of commercial debts.'' They also agreed to encourage the substitution of ''more stable long-term finance, both direct and portfolio, for short-term bank lending.''"

Giuseppe Consolo, Mr. Antonov's Italian laywer, confirmed in a telephone interview that he had been told of the prosecutor's action. He said that he had not seen the document but that the charges were ''probably for complicity'' in the shooting of the Pope on May 13, 1981. Mr. Albano could not be reached for confirmation of the report."

As Pete Seeger once said, after receiving prolonged applause for competently whistling a tune, ''that's not precisely what I'd like to be known for.''   Like any chronic dissenter, I choose to believe that the world has gone astray, not I. And I plead both law and history, for the fact that by some curious quirk, I find myself defending the best elements of the antitrust law that came to fruition under the Nixon and Ford F.T.C.'s.   Throughout the early and mid- 1970's, these sober Republican commissions steadfastly applied the Clayton Act which directs us to enjoin any merger that ''may'' substantially lessen competition. So vigorous was this enforcement tradition in challenging mergers of even marginal competitors that the joining of major competitors in the oil and auto industries as we have seen recently was unthinkable."

Last Tuesday, Saudi Arabian F-15 jet fighters, guided by Awacs surveillance planes, shot down an Iranian F-4 Phantom and forced several other Iranian jets to turn back in an air clash almost in the middle of the gulf.

Chernenko became the Soviet leader, the Kremlin has settled into a hostile mood of a kind that has rarely been seen since the height of the cold war 30 years ago.  Recent weeks have seen a sharp turning inward, a curtailment of ties with the West and a resort to something approaching rudeness in dealing with official visitors who have sought a return to compromise.    Little is known about the workings of the Kremlin under Mr. Chernenko, but one view among Western diplomats is that the mood owes at least something to the character of the new Soviet leader, a peasant's son from Siberia, who has shown over the years that he has strong instincts of the kind associated with conservative Russian leaders.   Apparently his views are reinforced in the current climate by those of Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko, who has emerged as the most powerful figure around Mr. Chernenko. Those attitudes include suspicion of the West, a rigid pride in the Soviet Union and a quick hostility toward anything seen as denigrating or threatening."

To understand the prevailing sentiment toward Gulf on Wall Street, a little background might help. Gulf incurred some disfavor among professional traders when it abandoned its 1982 attempt to buy Cities Service. In the midst of a takeover contest, government scrutiny of the deal for possible antitrust violations cooled Gulf's ardor and Mr. Lee was quoted as saying he ''had no stomach for this kind of thing.'' As a result, many Wall Street risk arbitragers who had bought Cities Service stock in anticipation of a successful takeover suffered losses as the stock plunged.

No major political or diplomatic event that has occurred in London since Mrs. Thatcher took office five years ago has had so little overt involvement from the Prime Minister - a surprising circumstance, as one Western diplomat commented, for someone ''usually so fond of standing up to people who she thinks are trying to push Britain around.''   For the first 72 hours after the fatal shooting of Constable Yvonne Fletcher, the Prime Minister was in Lisbon on an official visit, an important trip but not one whose cancellation would have caused vast problems. When she returned, she went to Chequers, her country estate, for the weekend. And when the decision to sever diplomatic relations with Tripoli was announced last Sunday, it was explained to the press not by Mrs. Thatcher but by Richard Luce, a junior minister at the Foreign Office."

For many months, I have encouraged the Soviet Union to join with us in a major effort to see if we could make progress in these broad problem areas, reducing the threat and use of force in solving international disputes, reducing armaments in the world and establishing a better working relationship with each other.   Let me describe to you some of the many efforts that we're making to establish a better workng relationship with the Soviet Union.   We have informed the Soviet Government that we're prepared to initiate negotiations on a new exchanges agreement, and we've completed our preparations for these negotiations. We propose to resume preparations to open consulates in New York and Kiev. We've taken steps to remove our - or revive our agreements for cooperation in environmental protection, housing, health and agriculture. Activities under these agreements have waned in recent years, because there've been no meetings of their joint committees to plan projects."

The sources say the mining operation marks the first time since the United States began supporting Nicaraguan rebels three years ago that Americans have become directly involved in military operations against Nicaragua.   The actual placement of the mines inside Nicaraguan territorial waters, they said, is handled by an elite group of Latin American commandos who use small, high-speed boats to penetrate shipping lanes close to shore.   'Closer to Direct Confrontation'    The officials said that unlike ground operations inside Nicaragua conducted by rebel forces, which American advisers monitor from Honduras but do not control, the planting of the mines in Nicaraguan waters directly involves Americans and is under their immediate control."

Each of the three men running for the Presidential nomination - former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Senator Gary Hart and the Rev.

Mr. Rubin, whose campaign title is finance chairman for New York, and his associates raised $1.9 million for Mr. Mondale last year, which he said represented more than 20 percent of the total amount contributed throughout the country.   ''I've spent most of my time trying to recruit people who, in turn, would give fund-raising events,'' he said yesterday.

That year, nearly $2 billion poured into drilling partnerships, but in the last couple of years, sagging oil prices, generally disappointing returns of drilling partnerships and the well-publicized financial problems of a few oil and gas tax shelter program sponsors have slaked investors' oil fever. Interest has declined so sharply that in the first three months of this year, sales of publicly registered drilling partnerships were down 43 percent from a year earlier, to a paltry $65 million, according to Robert A. Stanger & Company, a tax shelter research firm based in Shrewsbury, N.J.    But a number of investment advisers believe oil and gas drilling ventures hold more favorable opportunities than the sales figures suggest, mainly because the economics of the business has sharply improved.    ''For a lot of reasons, it's the best of times,'' said Martin Helpern, a tax partner at Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting firm."

''Perhaps it's because we don't have the visibility of having a big New York store, or that we don't give parties as some of the other retailers do or have their glamour,'' he said. ''But we think that our results would speak louder than any of those things.''    Mr. Macioce, who at 65 has held the post of C.E.O. longer than anyone else among the major department store chains and who has built Allied into an industry giant ranking among the nation's top seven or eight retail chains, is nearing the end of his long assignment.

As the leaders concluded their deliberations at Lancaster House, tens of thousands of antinuclear demonstrators marched through the streets of central London, carrying banners and placards denouncing American policy. The organizers said more than 150,000 people took part. They were kept well away from the conference sites by the police, but traffic was paralyzed and more than 170 people were arrested for obstruction during the march and two smaller protests.

Bankers should remember that once confidence is lost, whether through bad loans, bad management or just bad publicity, there soon is very little left of a bank.   What is a bank? One wonders about this looking at Continental, the largest bank in the heartland of the United States and long considered a pillar of strength. Yet, it survives now only because of the extremely generous assistance provided by the regulatory agencies and by fellow bankers who feared that Continental's demise could lead to major problems of their own."

They have drawn important speakers from corporate management and universities who have echoed the need for broadly trained managers and increased recruitment of college graduates with a liberal arts background.    Ralph Z. Sorenson, who combines a business and academic background, sounded an alarm of sorts at a recent seminar for the Boston region. Mr. Sorenson is chairman of the Barry Wright Corporation of Watertown, Mass., a diversified maker of computer accessory equipment, and former president of Babson, a business- oriented college in the Boston area that also offers the master of business administration degree.    One problem, he said, lies with corporate officials who do the interviewing or hiring. They ''are typically placing a much higher value on practical and professional skills, such as accounting, finance, marketing, engineering and computer science than they are on the candidate's grasp of history, politics, philosophy, literature, science or ability to think analytically,'' Mr. Sorenson said."

In a second-story office, above the store's fish market, Tomio Moriguchi, a 47-year-old United States citizen who is Uwajimaya's president, puffs on a pipe as he presides over the $20 million-a-year operation, the largest such Japanese retail and wholesale business with American ownership in the nation.    Mr. Moriguchi says the company's philosophy - developed by his father, Fujimatsu, who founded Uwajimaya as a fish market in 1928 - has been ''to take care of the home front first, our Asian customers, and then expand to the general market.''    Stores in Other Cities    Similar stores are springing up in other cities, largely to accommodate the influx of Japanese executives moving to this country to open branches of Japanese corporations. For example, there is Katagiri & Company in New York, Yaohan in suburban Los Angeles and Toguri in Chicago. But they are all smaller and owned by Japan-based companies."

CREDIT: A BUYOUT PIONEER,"   As one of the biggest purveyors of financing for leveraged buyouts and an aggressive proponent of ''creative financing'' for American companies, the General Electric Credit Corporation is growing rapidly in the turbulent financial services industry.    The credit subsidiary of the General Electric Company has been expanding on its business beyond consumer financing for more than 20 years. Beginning in 1965, long before leveraged buyouts became a fad on Wall Street, the company began financing such transactions, and has been active in more than five such transactions each year.    The company has, nonetheless, remained outside the increasing controversy that has surrounded L.B.O's in recent months by adhering to a long- standing policy of financing the buyouts of relatively small companies in transactions negotiated in relatively friendly terms.    For example, two groups that have received G.E. credit financing for these transactions in the last 12 months included the senior management of Microdot Inc., a subsidiary of Northwest Industries, which was taken private for $125 million, and Farley Industries, which bought out the shares of the N.L. Metal Products Group for $118 million,    Some Warnings Sounded    Leveraged buyouts are transactions in which public companies are taken private by management or others who borrow to purchase the shares. As a lender, G.E. Credit has typically assumed that future earnings of the companies would be used to pay off the buyout debt."

The Black Hebrews are a group of roughly 1,000 American blacks who say they are descended from the original Jews and have settled - most without official consent - in southern Israel.   As far as the Israeli Government is concerned, most of the Black Hebrews have no legal status in Israel, since they came in on three-month tourist visas and simply stayed on, and they have no rabbinically recognized connection to Judaism.   An Israeli Interior Ministry official said that to make them citizens would contradict both the letter and the spirit of Israeli law; to expel them, he said, would be awkward and perhaps logistically impossible because the United States could put noncitizens right back onto a plane to Israel."

The companies here in North Staffordshire are keeping a closer watch on overseas competitors, paying more attention to the tastes of trend- setting American consumers, stepping up marketing and increasing their investments in automation.   The last element is depressing news here in The Potteries, as this city of 250,000 and the neighboring towns are known. The region, which produces everything from fine china to toilet bowls, accounts for more than 80 percent of the British ceramics industry's $700 million output, and it bore the brunt of job losses that cut the industry's employment to 35,000 from 55,000 and brought the region's current unemployment rate to 12.2 percent."

This year's heavy bargaining calendar includes some powerhouse unions - the auto workers, miners and postal workers - and their leaders are making tough statements about hefty wage increases ahead. Washington fears that a few heavyweight wage pacts could push consumer prices skyward and endanger the recovery. ''The economic outlook,'' said Robert Ortner, chief economist for the Department of Commerce, ''is to a great extent in the hands of labor and management. But despite the springtime rumblings from labor and worried words from the Administration, the dam is not likely to burst on wages this year - or the next. Double-digit wage raises appear to be a fading memory, not a realistic fear for the immediate future. Though wages are expected to rise this year by slightly more than last year's 5 percent, organized labor is also expected to be less aggressive during the recovery under way than in any recent postwar recovery. Nevertheless, many labor analysts say 1984 may produce major innovations for some industries, such as lifetime job security and more flexible compensation packages. Labor's new moderation reflects sweeping changes in the environment in which labor operates - and in labor's attitudes resulting from those changes. The nation's unemployment rate, though down to 7.8 percent from 10.7 percent at the end of 1982, is still high by historical standards."

While the Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.40 points, to 1,138.30, yesterday, the spot June Value Line futures closed down 25 points, at 177.95, and the June S.& P. 500 contract was up 20 points, at 157.80.   With the movement of each point representing $5 per contract, holders of the spread made $225 because, in this rare instance, both legs of the spread produced gains. The best that futures spreaders normally hope for is that one leg will make more money than the other loses."

Scotland Yard took the Libyans to a ''safe house'' in the London suburbs, where they were closely questioned, before putting them aboard a Libyan Arab Airlines flight to Tripoli.   The group was believed almost certainly to have included the gunman who, according to witnesses, killed a policewoman, Yvonne Fletcher, and wounded 10 opponents of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, who were demonstrating outside the embassy on April 17.   Tonight, the Libyans were reported to have received a vociferous welcome in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.  In a carefully synchronized move, the remaining British officials in Libya hauled down the Union Jack over their embassy, and all but two of them then left for home. (Page 3.)"

The leasing project is regarded as very delicate by the Administration, which does not want to hurt relations with the Saudis, already strained over the abrupt suspension of the Stinger sale to Saudi Arabia and Jordan in the face of overwhelming Congressional criticism. The missile can be fired by one soldier from a shoulder-held launcher."

Government sources said that for the second time since the Cabinet came to office April 30, a compromise could not be worked out between Moslem ministers, who want the army returned to its barracks and put under the control of a six-member Cabinet committee representing the country's various religious factions, and Christian leaders, who want the army to continue to carry out day-to-day security tasks under a Christian-dominated command.   The nine Moslem and Christian ministers, who met for two hours, were also understood to disagree on the question of how to deal with Israeli and Syrian occupying forces."

''We are disappointed that the prime interest rate has increased to 12 1/2 percent,'' said Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, in a statement. He added that, ''although the economy has been growing at a healthy pace and inflation remains at a low level, it appears the money supply is not accommodating real economic growth.''

A bill to keep banks from diversifying into other financial services passed a House subcommittee.

The effort, the officials said, has thus far been unsuccessful. But the United States has been promoting all indications that it is gaining, they assert, thus deepening existing conflicts within the Government of President Luis Alberto Monge, who is firmly committed to the nation's neutrality, and strengthening the hand of his opponents in the country who are more supportive of Washington's position.   Some officials expressed concern that the United States was preparing an invasion of Nicaragua, and that clashes between the Sandinista forces and Costa Rica - which has no standing army - would be used as the political justification for the action."

That seems true at some firms. At Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, according to the ''National Law Journal Directory,'' only 1 percent of the young lawyers that joined the firm in 1973 and 1974 became partners. Of the New York firms listed, the second-hardest place to make partner seems to be Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, where 9 percent of the first-year associates hired in 1973 became partners."

It said the contracts were $88.4 million for 80 F/ A-18 aircraft and four TF/A-18 aircraft, $29.4 million for engineering and technical maintenance manuals for F/A-18 aircraft and $8.8 million for 32 AV-BB aircraft."

They build turnkey plants for making chemicals, steel, plastics and almost any other product from Mexico to Malaysia.     This industry's orders fell to $5.5 billion last year, nearly 30 percent less than in 1982 and roughly half of 1981's $11.1 billion.    Reasons for the poor prospects range from increasing overseas competition to the slowdown in oil producers' industrialization plans and reduced investment in countries of the Eastern bloc and the third world. Many developing nations are investing less in their economies so they can meet payments on their huge foreign debt."

They said they hoped the company would take the action voluntarily, adding that lower energy costs were necessary to make New York more attractive to businesses. However, city officials warned they would initiate legal action if they did not get an ''affirmative response'' from the company by May 23.   A Con Edison spokesman said the company would discuss the issue with the city before making a formal response. But the spokesman, Laurence Kleinman, said the company believed its current structure had ''a lot of merit,'' and any change could cause problems for shareholders and customers. Mr. Kleinman said one reason the utility was not requesting a rate increase this year was because of its strong ratio of equity to debt, which city officials want reduced."

Turner, the new leader of Canada's Liberal Party, said Friday that he would be sworn in as Prime Minister next Saturday.    The announcement came as Brian Mulroney, leader of the opposition Progressive Conservative Party, ended a three-day visit to Washington to confer with President Reagan and other top officials.  Earlier this week, President Reagan also invited Mr. Turner to visit Washington.     Mr. Turner, who was elected head of the Liberal Party last Saturday, will automatically replace Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who is resigning. Mr. Turner will then call an election later this year."

In between the arrival of Rupert Murdoch at The Chicago Sun-Times in January and the continuing saga of the shaky Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, a series of mergers, stock deals and extraordinary exchange trades have helped change the way Chicago thinks of itself.   During the recession its status as the nation's ''second city'' was lost to Los Angeles as the Sun Belt and the suburbs continued to drain away population and resources. LaSalle Street, the Chicago equivalent of Wall Street, fell into the doldrums. Chicago's chief distinction - insular capital of the nation's industrial and agricultural heartland - became a dubious honor.   'Rust Bowl' and Commodities Regional companies, such as International Harvester, wobbled on the edge of insolvency. More plants were abandoned. The term ''rust bowl,'' meaning areas of industrial blight, entered the language. And Middle Western farmers, never having fully recovered since the 1980 limitation of grain shipments to the Russians, continued to cry about low commodity prices."

Developed on the windswept Manchurian plain without foreign assistance or technology, Daqing has been producing 1 million barrels of oil a day - about half of China's daily total output. Now, the overworked wells of the aging field are being squeezed to produce a new burst of oil. In effect, the Chinese are trying to keep Daqing and their handful of other onshore fields going strong until the vast effort to find petroleum offshore finally pays off.    That might take eight or 10 years, according to the Western oil companies that are spending millions to explore for oil along China's long coastline. So far, their exploratory wells have come up dry, or with only traces of oil. Even if the ocean yields major oil fields, the Western companies doubt that China could begin offshore production before 1992."

But like so many Turkish young people, Miss Aygen got caught up in the political turmoil of 1980, was arrested after the army seized power and now four years later, is a defendant in a mass trial of young leftists before an Istanbul military tribunal.   The military prosecutor has charged that she was involved in terrorist activities, a charge that she and her relatives deny. She, in turn, has asserted that she is being tortured in prison. She is on a hunger strike to back demands for improved prison conditions."

They said that overall, the Dutch move seemed to be a step toward eventual installation of the 48 cruise missiles assigned to the Netherlands.   There had been fear in the highest levels of the Administration that the Dutch Government, which had been divided on the question of deploying the missiles, might resign in disagreement, forcing new elections that could lead to a new government more inclined to reject deployment altogether."

By now, Mr. Reagan has practiced perhaps a dozen explanations of why - after years of complaints by other world leaders - the deficit has refused to disappear, and why it may not matter that it hasn't.    Listeners who plead skepticism about one explanation are quickly provided with another. But some are apparently still unpersuaded. For example, Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, told reporters the American position was ''simple-minded.''"

But the lines of more than 40 heavy trucks parked on the dusty mountain road, the battered Mercedes taxis with piles of baggage roped to the roof and the families squatting in the shade are regular sights even when the road is open.   Since Feb. 29, when Israel blocked the coastal highway running through the major cities of Sidon and Tyre about 10 miles south of Beirut, the only way to get between the fertile coastline and rolling hills of the southern part of the country and the capital has been through this checkpoint. Rival Christian and Druse militias had been fighting near Damur, but both have since issued statements saying they wanted the coastal road reopened."

''It is simply impossible, in domestic political terms, for us to deploy in full on time,'' said a ranking Dutch diplomat who backs the cruise program.  ''To put 48 missiles in here on schedule, just like that, another job done, is a hopelessly unrealistic proposition.''   United States officials in Europe and in Washington fear that a Dutch failure to carry out their 1979 commitment in full could lead to a breakdown in the NATO plan for deployment of 572 medium-range missiles in five countries. Opinion in Belgium and West Germany could change. And, the officials say, pressure on the Soviet Union to resume arms talks would evaporate."

Norstar, which is the 11th-largest banking concern in New York State, announced in April that it would purchase Albany's Union Station, which has been vacant since 1968, and convert the turn-of-the-century landmark into its headquarters.

The long-planned meeting, beginning three days after the end of the London summit talks of the non-Communist industrial nations, will likely serve to underscore Soviet pre-eminence in the bloc, after a period of frequent leadership changes in Moscow, and document the East bloc's unity at a time of strained East-West ties, according to Western diplomats and economists.    If Western summit meetings are faulted for failing to keep promises, the Moscow gathering may prove a clone of its Western model.    Though the last economic summit meeting of the leaders of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon, in April 1969, laid the groundwork for the widened East-West industrial and financial ties of the 1970's, the Moscow meeting is thought likely to offer little in the way of major policy shifts or long-term remedies for the East bloc's pressing economic problems, such as its towering debt and cumbersome trade system."

A poll would no doubt show that far more people would agree with President Kennedy - ''In the minds of men the world over, the initials T.V.A. stand for progress'' - than with President Eisenhower, who disliked it so much he sought to ''sell the whole thing'' off to private enterprise. Just try to find an encyclopedia, for example, that fails to portray the T.V.A. as having brought unprecedented growth to an almost hopelessly backward region.        But some analysis of the T.V.A.'s first half century seems to show such praise, now elevated to national mythology, to be almost entirely unjustified. According to two current critics, approaching the issue from different perspectives, the ideas on which the T.V.A. was built are fundamentally flawed and will lead to similarly bad results when applied elsewhere in this country or in underdeveloped countries of the third world."

One finds bonds of at least half a dozen companies that are in bankruptcy proceedings, shares in more than a dozen corporations that are being liquidated and dozens of stocks that are selling well below their book value.    But what may seem at first to be a junkyard of mistakes is actually a treasure-trove of hidden values, says Max Heine, the 73-year-old president and co-founder of the fund. For 35 years now, he and his associates have been searching out stocks and bonds whose beaten down prices are a scant reflection of their true worth.    By sticking doggedly to that belief, the $343 million fund has racked up one of the best records in the mutual fund fraternity. It currently is ranked sixth out of more than 600 funds for its most recent 12-month improvement in price per share, and it is first out of 92 funds in the growth and income category, according to Lipper Analytical Securities. Over the past 10 years, it ranks eighth with a 712 percent overall gain in share value."

RCA had continued to produce the players long after anemic sales figures convinced analysts and other manufacturers that the players would never catch on. But RCA's chairman, Thornton F.

The Fed raised the discount rate to 9 percent on Friday. Investors had been expecting, but fearing, the move since the Federal Open Market Committee meeting two weeks ago. The half-point increase, coming one day after major banks raised their prime rates by half a point, to 12 percent, was interpreted by some as reflecting a tighter monetary policy by the Fed in an attempt to turn the economic boom into steady expansion. But others said the higher discount rate, which is the interest rate charged to institutions that borrow from the Fed, was simply a reflection of the current upward pressure on short-term rates. It was the first increase in the discount rate in three years."

Last week, the warnings began Thursday because it was assumed, correctly as it turned out, that most traders would not wait until Friday to cover their positions.

Analysts and utility regulators said the move could be a prelude to bankruptcy, a possibility that the utility, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, and its auditors have raised in recent weeks. Others said the layoffs could be the first step in canceling the entire project in a last-minute effort to keep the utility solvent.    Public Service of New Hampshire said the move would save the company and its partners in the project $750,000 a day in construction costs. But analysts said that overhead, primarily interest costs on the $2.5 billion already spent, would continue to run about $1 million a day."

The United States, particularly the East Coast, is now said to get most of its heroin from the Khyber area, which since 1980 has supplanted the ''golden triangle'' in Southeast Asia as the world's biggest heroin-producing region.   At the same time, the rapidly swelling flow of Khyber heroin and opium across the Indian-Pakistani border has reportedly stimulated drug use at several levels of Indian society, from the farm workers of Punjab, who have opium in their morning tea, to the literati of Bombay, who have begun taking it in cold milk as a party drink.   India has found itself in the middle of the world of hard drugs, the authorities say, because previous conduits out of Pakistan are being increasingly blocked by enforcement efforts there as well as at European and American airports.

The bill, sponsored by Fernand J.

The McDonnell Douglas engineer will be the first person from private industry to voyage into space, and with him a new era for business will be launched, one that could extend forever the frontiers of corporate America.    ''It's a new area, an area that is providing a great service to mankind in general, and it's one of the most exciting technologies for our future corporate activity,'' said an exuberant John Yardley, president of McDonnell Douglas, of the experiment that his engineer will conduct on board. In fact, he said, ''we're a little nervous we won't be able to expand fast enough, once demand for the products builds.''    The journey to space by Mr. Walker, a 35-year-old ''commercial payload specialist,'' could lead to the development of the first product made in space by a private company, a new drug that scientists and analysts say could be a major advance in the treatment of diabetes.

Carroll of Gintel & Company. Major cost factors are behind the industry, Mr. Carroll said, and leaders of the two big steel companies cited the success of their moves to modernize and cut costs."

Negotiations over the demands of the Akali Dal, the Sikh political party that started the agitation for greater autonomy in Punjab in 1982, seem to be in limbo.   Some say they believe the raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, has transformed the situation, leaving the Akali demands and the negotiations all but irrelevant for the time being.   Questions have been raised about both the future influence and personal status of Harchand Singh Longowal, the Akali leader who was arrested in the Indian Army raid on the temple on June 5-6.

Such a change may not be bad for the economy. In fact, it could eventually lead to slower, more stable economic growth.   While recessions are characterized by business selling off its inventories, recoveries are normally led by business restocking the shelves. This leads to an inventory buildup at the bottom of a recession that propels the initial surge of economic growth. But this time, consumer spending generated most of the growth during the first year of the recovery, while inventories declined to record lows relative to sales."

There is ebullient talk about ''a new era'' of Chinese-American relations, reminiscent not so much of the uncharted opening that President Nixon created in China 12 years ago as it is of Mr. Nixon's effort later in 1972 to draw the Soviet Union into a less menacing relationship with the lure of mutually profitable economic partnership and political parity.    Since the Chinese no longer favor open military cooperation nor drop hints about a link to the Atlantic alliance, as some Chinese did five years ago, the Americans are not pressing this time for a strategic partnership with China."

Production goals of 500,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent by 1987 and 2.2 million barrels a day by 1992 (more than 25 percent of our current production) were written into the law.   These goals were unrealistic then and are now clearly impossible. With the slack oil market making the large-scale commercial production of synthetic fuels increasingly uneconomical and unnecessary, some people are now calling for an end to the synfuels program. Others suggest it be scaled back to a research program within the Department of Energy."

Their willingness to increase inventories despite current high financing costs means they are confident they can sell these goods quickly and profitably.    The buildup has been such that when the Government issues its report this Friday on February inventories, it will show a rise of at least eight-tenths of 1 percent, or double the January increase, said Edward E.  Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.  Equally important, Mr.  Yardeni noted, the inventory-sales ratio for February could rise to 1.33, from 1.30 in January.

With more than 1,400 locally controlled cooperatives offering members food and household goods at reasonable prices - plus a share of the profits based on how much they bought - the loose-knit movement with headquarters here had become a major presence in working-class life. Indeed, from the first successful retail society founded eight miles north of here, Co-operative groups had branched out into manufacturing, farming, banking, insurance, education, and had even formed a political party that was soon to elect representatives to the House of Commons.   But the 20th century has not been easy on the Co-operative Movement. Today, the 1,400 societies have shrunk to 120 - and those that survive are plagued by the desertion of their working-class constituents, lack of central planning and tough new price competition from chain stores.   Indeed, the movement's close association with the Labor Party and the working class has become a mixed blessing at best. As the life style of many workers has improved, their feelings of class solidarity have waned."

A Government spokesman said Bonn regretted The Hague's inability to carry out ''fully and according to schedule'' a 1979 North Atlantic Treaty Organization decision to deploy the new United States missiles.   The spokesman, J""urgen Sudhoff, said Bonn feared the Dutch decision would cause misunderstandings in Moscow."

Since Mr. Goldberg, publisher and president, and his cousin Mr. Levine, a vice president and son of Eli Levine, the inactive chairman, took over the operation seven years ago, they have come up with a new advertising medium on almost a yearly basis. And always within their own area of expertise.   The latest, the American Baby Hospital Network, should really appeal to advertisers interested in intimate one-on-one communication with young mamas, and surprisingly it has also caught the imagination of that leading proponent of mass communications, the Procter & Gamble Company."

The Assembly also passed a seventh bill giving emergency borrowing power to school districts with funds frozen by the bankruptcy proceedings.   However, the borrowing bill is different from a version passed Tuesday by the Senate, so a common version will have to be worked out between the two bodies next week."

''They all, including the French, simply cannot get over it,''    said one pleased Reagan Administration official.   The setting was the recent London economic summit meeting. The subject was jobs. And the mood among the Europeans was one of envy.    No wonder. In the last decade, while Western Europe lost some 2 million jobs, the United States created about 20 million. And since the current American recovery got under way, the gap has widened. Major European countries continue to lose jobs, while payrolls grow in the United States - not just in the dominant services sector which has been virtually recession-proof for decades, but also in devastated manufacturing. Some 5 million Americans have found new work in non-agricultural jobs since the bottom of the recession, making this the best recovery on the job front since the 1950's."

A $100 million issue due in 2014 was offered with a lower 10 3/8 percent yield, because interest and principal were guaranteed by the Municipal Bond Insurance Association and therefore rated AAA by Standard & Poor's.

Under a proposal said to have been made this week by the Argentine Government, Argentina would pay the banks $500 million in interest on its $47 billion in debt by the end of June so that payments on all of its loans would be no more than 90 days past due.    Argentina would use $350 million of its own money, and borrow the remaining $150 million from a group of 11 international banks. Under an arrangement similar to one reached at the end of the first quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would assure the banks that they would be repaid. This would be possible because the Fed would receive authorization from Argentina to withdraw the money from Argentina's account at the Fed to repay the banks when the payments became due."

The movie, shown at a gala premiere in New York and at a by-invitation-only screening here, is about a baseball hitter blessed with mythic power and cursed with bad luck - one who, invariably, either smashes the ball into the bleachers for a home run or strikes out miserably.    It's not a bad metaphor for Hollywood. Indeed, given the vagaries of the movie business, both Tri-Star and its film could meet either fate. But whatever the weekend box office, Tri- Star is determined to a become a force - an ''instant major,'' company executives call it - in the movie industry. A major, in the Hollywood lexicon, is a company that distributes upwards of 15 movies each year, some that it has produced itself, others ''picked up'' from producers elsewhere. By most counts, there are only six majors left today: Columbia, MGM-UA, Paramount, Warner Brothers, 20th Century-Fox and Universal (Walt Disney Pictures' production has dropped too low). And the odds against Tri-Star making a seventh are daunting. Not since 1924, with the formation of Columbia Pictures, has any company succeeded in becoming a major."
