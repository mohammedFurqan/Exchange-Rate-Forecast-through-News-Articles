Braniff shut down and filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 and was reorganized through a $70 million buyout by the Hyatt Corporation, the Chicago- based hotel chain."

Similar in its organization to other well-known medical institutions such as the Mayo and Leahy Clinics, the Cleveland Clinic differs from many other clinics in the richness and variety of services and facilities it offers to V.I.P. patients.   In recent years, the clinic has treated such dignitaries as King Hussein, Dr. Albert Sabin, who had a heart bypass operation there, and the heads or leading officials of many countries."

The sensation was George Gilder, author of ''Wealth and Poverty.'' Mr. Gilder called his 1981 book ''a theology of capitalism''; supply-side economists saw the work as their bible, and embraced it as their own. David Stockman, calling it ''Promethean in its intellectual power and insight,'' gave copies of the book to new Administration appointees; President Reagan delivered a copy, complete with national press coverage, as a get-well present to an ailing Senator Bob Dole. At the same time, liberal critics called the book's conservative economic theories the ''loopy'' products of a ''crackpot.''"

Pratt's parent company, United Technologies, is Connecticut's largest employer.    The decision will hit hardest in the industrial city of East Hartford, where the engines are assembled. Parts for the engines are made in Pratt & Whitney plants in Middletown, North Haven and Southington, said Frank Giusti, a spokesman for United Technologies."

Full membership, which allows one to trade any contract in any pit, sells for $320,000 or so. Even the most limited membership fetches about $20,000.    Kevin Bulman got onto the floor for $200 a month.   Like individuals who do not have the savings to buy their dream house and thus rent from the more fortunate, commodities traders are increasingly renting memberships today. For as little as $150 a month, a trader with big dreams and a tiny bankroll can find himself jousting away in some of the newer pits."

If the marines withdraw from Lebanon in the near future, the officials believe, there will be widespread panic and chaos. In addition, they say, American credibility and interests in the Arab world will be seriously damaged for a long time to come.   They add, however, that if the marines remain - even to the end of the 18-month limit agreed on by Congress and the President - there is at this time no reason to expect that the conflict will be any closer to a solution or that the marines' exit some time in the future will be any less problematic then if they departed tomorrow.   In effect, these officials and analysts say, the marines have become hostages of the Lebanese crisis. The only way they can withdraw within a reasonable period of time and without leaving chaos and a trail of broken promises in their wake is through a constructive solution to the nine-year- old Lebanese crisis."

There will be no substantial reduction in the budget deficit before the fiscal year 1988, the officials said. The deficit for the fiscal year 1984, which began last Oct. 1, is projected at $184 billion, down from $195 billion the year before.    Officials said all final decisions on the 1985 budget had been made. ''We are locked up,'' one of them remarked.

But slowly, as the importance of revisions in the Japanese commercial code has come to be appreciated, things are starting to change: Japanese shareholders are talking back.    Thus, while the typical annual meeting until recently might have lasted no more that 20 minutes or so - just long enough for management to get its proposals rubber-stamped - they have become far more drawn out in recent months. Indeed, some have turned into marathons."

Largely as a result, farm production for 1983-84 has soared to record levels, far surpassing anything India ever saw before.

The officials said that small United States ground units would conduct limited maneuvers, some of which will take place in the region of Honduras between El Salvador and Nicaragua, from now until the start of a large exercise in June. The exercises are intended to intimidate Salvadoran guerrillas and their Nicaraguan backers, one official said."

If the marines withdraw from Lebanon in the near future, the officials believe, there will be widespread panic and chaos. In addition, they say, American credibility and interests in the Arab world will be seriously damaged for a long time to come.   They add, however, that if the marines remain - even to the end of the 18-month limit agreed on by Congress and the President - there is at this time no reason to expect that the conflict will be any closer to a solution or that the marines' exit some time in the future will be any less problematic then if they departed tomorrow.   In effect, these officials and analysts say, the marines have become hostages of the Lebanese crisis. The only way they can withdraw within a reasonable period of time and without leaving chaos and a trail of broken promises in their wake is through a constructive solution to the nine-year- old Lebanese crisis."

Since then his ''Star Wars'' speech has inspired furious debate about whether powerful lasers placed in orbit could shoot down enemy missiles, how much such a system would cost, and whether it would trigger yet another round in the arms race.   Because space-based lasers are still largely imaginary from an engineering standpoint, none of these questions are likely to be answered soon. George Keyworth, the President's science adviser and an expert on lasers, has judged that the hardware is at least 20 years away. To answer the question of how programs to build a laser defense system would translate into jobs means gazing into a crystal ball that could be shattered at any time by myriad political forces."

On one side, apparently, stands Rupert Murdoch, an Australian publishing executive with a penchant for being both secretive and sensational. On the other is the flamboyant Steven J. Ross, whose vast Warner entertainment conglomerate has been badly battered of late, and Mr. Ross's most recent ally, Herbert J. Siegel, a scrappy, high-living investor and chairman of Chris-Craft Industries who has never given up his romance with the movie business.    For Mr. Murdoch, buying up to 49.9 percent of Warner - as he announced yesterday he plans to do - would be the greatest gamble yet in a career of risky ventures. For Mr. Ross, who built Warner into a major force in the entertainment industry, it would be a battle for control of his company. And for Mr. Siegel, who seemed to come to Mr. Ross's rescue last month, it would be an avenue back into the movie business."

The name is somewhat forbidding - ''in-substance defeasance'' - but the pitch is easy: pay off large amounts of old, cheap debt with smaller amounts of new bonds that pay high interest rates and, through some accounting magic, report extra profits and clean up the balance sheet.   ''You could see a couple billion dollars of it done in early 1984,'' said John H. Erdman, a principal at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''I can tell you there's a lot of talk about it.''   Corporate Cash Use Questioned    The issue, however, is whether this new financial maneuver is a poor use of corporate cash and another example of short-term accounting gimmickry to dress up one quarter's profits at the expense of a carefully developed corporate strategy for generating long-term profits.

But the recovery, accompanied by unusually high unemployment,has not been a normal one for the industry, which is only now beginning to tote up impressive sales.  ''The first priority of many consumers when the recovery began was to buy cars and other big-ticket items,'' says Michael Culp, restaurant industry analyst at Prudential- Bache Securities. Families, particularly those with more than one wage earner, are just beginning to flock to the fast-food chains now, Mr. Culp says.  Thus, he expects the leading chains' profits to surge by 20 percent this year, compared with more modest growth of 12 percent in 1983 and 9 percent in 1982.   Another phenomenon affecting industry revenues is an increasing willingness by diners to move up from the average $3 meal at a fast-food chain to one costing $4 or $5, ''provided the shop offers a quieter and more esthetically pleasing ambiance,'' Mr. Culp adds."

Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, so the story goes, three women from Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's family dropped in for a friendly visit. One was Nehru's daughter, Indira. While the women and the Mahatma chatted, Indira's 3-year- old son, Rajiv, played with the great man's feet, decorating his big toe with a garland of flowers.   The tableau fraught with dynastic symbolism is turning out to be more prophetic than anyone might have guessed. For as Nehru's daughter prepares for an election that is viewed as likely to extend her rule as India's Prime Minister into a third decade, her son has clearly emerged, after three years in politics, as the second most powerful figure in the country."

The counterfeited goods, which include copies of such brand-name products as Levi Strauss jeans, Capitol recordings of the Beatles and Cross pens, are manufactured abroad and sold both in the United States and in foreign countries.   The commission, a Government fact- finding agency that investigates trade matters, stressed in its 221-page study:   ''The quality difference can be of particular importance in some industries to the health and safety of the consumer, as is the case for defective auto parts, ineffective or nonsterile drugs and pharmaceuticals, and ineffective agricultural chemicals.''"

Andropov found ways to break the stagnation into which the Soviet economy had lapsed in the last years of the Brezhnev regime.    Those hopes are based partly on the improved economic performance in 1983, Mr. Andropov's one full year in office. Soviet industrial output increased 4 percent, compared with a gain of only 2.9 percent in 1982. Labor productivity in industry rose 3.5 percent last year. Mr. Andropov pushed up productivity by imposing tougher discipline on both workers and managers, however, and most economists view the gains from his crackdown on loafing, absenteeism and corruption as a one-shot improvement, which Mr. Chernenko cannot extend."

But if the buoyant retail season just ended showed anything, it is this: Americans will probably save less of their disposable income in 1984 than they did in the past two years.   The reason? ''Americans traditionally save less when they sense good economic times ahead, and more when they worry about their jobs and the economy generally,'' says Philip Braverman, chief economist at Briggs, Schaedle & Company, Government securities dealers.  In 1981, when the latest recession took hold, the annual rate of savings jumped to 6.6 percent of disposable income from 6 percent the year before. It then declined to a cyclical low of 4 percent in the second quarter of last year, Mr. Braverman says, and rose to 5 percent in the last quarter of 1983."

Fueling the optimism are recent upward revisions of forecasts for Japan's economic growth this year and surveys concluding that corporate earnings will rise sharply in 1984."

Under the leadership of Verghese Kurien, a champion of India's producer cooperatives, peanut farmers in Bhaunagar and four other districts of Gujarat began banding together in 1979 in an effort to break the hold of the area's powerful oil millers and traders on the peanut industry.   Their cooperative is part of a growing network of village units that are seeking to restructure the region's economy, which revolves around peanut production.   In Bombay, 200 miles south of the village of Rajpara, a wealthy oil miller told a visitor recently that he was pulling out of the peanut processing business because he thinks the cooperatives will eventually control the trade. The oil miller, Tulsidas Tanna, predicted this would happen because of the support the cooperatives receive from the Government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi."

The pattern is as uneven as the patchwork of Roman Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox faiths that crisscrosses the six junior partners of the Warsaw Pact, and it is colored by the struggles between the countries and various churches that occurred both before and after the imposition of Communism in the late 1940's.   Particularly in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland, clergymen and scholars say growing numbers of people are turning to - or turning back to - churches that, under Marxist theory, should be on the road to extinction. In cities in Bulgaria and Rumania, there are reports of increased churchgoing, but few signs of a major revival.   Not a Mass Movement    With the exception of Poland, where the Roman Catholic Church is the guardian of national aspirations, the movement of renewal is not a mass phenomenon. Rather, active Christians are normally a minority in societies that have become secularized through industrialization, Communist propaganda and persecution."

On the whole, professional military men here appeared inclined to accept the Iraqi statement that Iraq had stemmed the Iranian offensive and won a major victory in the southern sector near the Iraqi oil port of Basra. But these sources conceded that the Iraqi statements, like those by Iran, could not be verified because neither side has allowed foreign military attaches or independent reporters to visit the battlefields."

The latest statistics illustrate the difficulties the Government has in creating jobs and maintaining buying power. Unemployment accelerated in February, rising faster than the 9.8 percent rate of last year; inflation, running at 9.2 percent in 1983, remains at the same level, or more than twice as high as for France's main trade competitors; disposable income declined last year, and the national debt grew."

Such upstart airlines would proliferate and flourish, the thinking went, even taking on large carriers in major markets.    But for Pacific Express and about a dozen other carriers started since decontrol in 1978, the vision of the major airlines as cumbersome dinosaurs, unable to respond effectively to competition from feisty young fare cutters, has proved myopic.   Indeed, six years after deregulation, a new pattern is finally emerging in the airline industry. The pattern is that of a three-tiered industry with the major airlines - the strongest are United, American, Delta and Northeast - on top, dominating many of the most lucrative routes. They are co-existing more or less peacefully with a cadre of older, well- established regional airlines, among them Piedmont, Ozark, USAir and PSA. Most of the upstarts begun since 1978 are on the third tier, scrambling now for the leftovers."

Despite the upswing, Joseph W. Duncan, chief economist at the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, expects the number of new job openings in 1984 to decline to 3 million from last year's 4 million. Kathryn Eickhoff, executive vice president of Townsend-Greenspan & Company, says that 1984 is likely to be just as strong as 1983, perhaps even stronger.   What is significant, by Mr. Duncan's reckoning, is that large companies, which did relatively little hiring in 1983, are now increasing their work forces."

In his Budget Message to Congress, the President asked for cuts in domestic spending for the rest of the decade, a delay in major tax increases and more money for the military. (Page A1.) The $305.7 billion military budget includes 15 contracts worth more than $1 billion each that have been awarded to 10 companies. (D2.)   Democrats, sharply critical of Mr. Reagan, proposed spending cuts and tax increases that they said would reduce deficits by at least $200 billion over three years.

The new report shows that previous NATO estimates of growth in Soviet arms spending were overstated. Last year's report said real annual growth of at least 4 percent was continuing."

There was a bit of substance - a decline in the basic money supply figures - and a lot of hope behind the market's rebound Friday. On the latter score the Reagan Administration and Republican lawmakers agreed on a plan to cut the budget deficit by $150 billion over three years. But it is unclear how that plan will fare in Congress."

Top-selling cosmetics, perfumes and hair care products often command advertising budgets that exceed 10 percent of the revenues they generate. And anyone brash enough to introduce a new product into this field had better be ready to spend much more than that for early marketing and promotion.    Little wonder, then, that Chicago's Helene Curtis Industries has become one of Madison Avenue's big spenders. Since introducing its Finesse line of women's hair care products two years ago, its advertising budget has mushroomed from $4 million a year to a projected $30 million in 1984.

Optical physicists and electrical engineers are experimenting with ways to transform electical impulses into laser beams that can course through this incredibly clear glass fiber across continents and under oceans without being diminished through refraction.  The variety of skills needed to develop - and, ultimately, to manufacture, install and repair - fibers made of this substance, called halide glass, exemplifies the interdisciplinary nature of the work being done at the forefront of the rapidly advancing field of fiber optics.

The reason: In recent times the metal has failed, time and again, to respond to the sort of negative political and economic developments that the bullion market traditionally thrived on.   But now it seems that the pendulum of market sentiment has swung back again. For example, the metal, which a year ago traded at more than $500 an ounce and which had fallen to just below $370 at year- end, has risen in recent weeks, and last week was hovering around $400.  Analysts have attributed the turnabout to heightened fears about inflation and the worsening Middle East situation - the very kinds of news developments that the bullion market had been ignoring until only a few weeks ago.  ''What we are seeing is a basic change in gold market psychology, one that is peculiar to this trade,'' says Jeffrey A. Nichols, precious metals research director at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''Given the nature of the market, sentiment could just as easily reverse itself overnight.'' So does the recent price rise portend a rosy outlook for bullion prices? ''Investors in any market believe what they want to believe,'' Mr. Nichols says."

The approach, part of the Administration's general push for deregulation and promotion of free-market principles, has succeeded all too well as far as some of Mr. Miller's Congressional critics are concerned.    A subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the F.T.C., will call Mr. Miller to testify Monday and ask him to defend what panel members see as a systematic gutting of the function Congress intended the agency to perform.

Thanks to Europe's economic problems in the last decade, that debate has heated up again in most European nations. The recession and the industrial restructuring generated by it have led to state takeovers of numerous companies to prevent the job losses that would come with bankruptcy. At the same time, the economic troubles have persuaded millions of European voters that there are limits to how many social services they can afford to support.

Farmers in Tailandia and other communities close to the power line in the state of Para were reportedly affected by some epidemic or poisoning between December 1981 and June 1982, but the extent of their problems has only recently become known.   The high-voltage transmission line was laid in the late 1970's and early 80's from the Sobradinho dam on the Sao Francisco River to Belem in an effort to reduce the condumption of costly petroleum products in Para state.   Tailandia settlers said in newspaper interviews that, after bathing in nearby streams, members of their family fell ill, with some slipping into a coma and dying days later. Some women reported spontaneous abortions, headaches, stomach pains and swollen joints."

Earlier commitments from the West German, French and Spanish Governments to invest in the $2 billion project had made it likely that it would have been undertaken even without British participation, but British Aerospace's agreement to make the wings has made the 1988 delivery target feasible.   The A320 will give Airbus Industrie, an international consortium, the only all-new plane in the market for medium-range jets.

''The markets continued to suffer from a general lack of investor presence,'' said Maria Ramirez, a financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics. In addition to the heavy supply of recently auctioned Treasury notes and bonds, market participants said, prices would have a hard time rising because many investors fear that the strong growth of the economy and some measures of the money supply might cause the Federal Reserve to adopt a slightly tighter monetary policy in coming weeks.    In the money markets, the fear of a Fed tightening has caused rates to rise recently, despite small declines in yesterday's trading. At yesterday's auctions of new Treasury bills, rates were the highest since early September, with the three-month issue averaging 9.13 percent, up from 9.04 percent a week ago and 8.87 percent Jan. 30, while the six-month issue averaged 9.28 percent, up from 9.16 percent a week ago and 8.97 percent on Jan. 30."

The 53-year-old economist, who has spent more than 25 years in Washington working for such agencies as the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers, was the first women to serve as a Fed governor.    Mrs. Teeters was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978, when she was chief economist for the House Budget Committee, and was seen as one of the more liberal members of the Fed. In her more than five years on the board, she often disagreed with monetary policy decisions, particularly when she thought the Fed was pushing interest rates too high.    However, despite her dissents, she generally went along with the central bank's tight monetary policy of the early 1980's, having decided that the less stringent Fed policies of the 1970's had not been successful in curbing inflation."

Ruling on another aspect of the case, the Court voted, 5 to 4, that, once a company has filed a bankruptcy petition, it may unilaterally breach its collective- bargaining agreements with labor unions while awaiting the bankruptcy court's formal permission to do so.   The decision grew out of the 1980 bankruptcy filing by the Bildisco Manufacturing Company, a New Jersey building supply concern. The decision, applying to companies that request reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, seems likely to encourage the use of the bankruptcy law by companies seeking relief from high labor costs."

According to one of the diplomats, discussions with Soviet officials have produced ''evidence of a link'' between Soviet interest in a statement renouncing the use of force and a resumption of the talks on limiting strategic and medium-range nuclear missiles, which broke up late last year.   The diplomat said it would be up to West to decide whether to test ''a number of fairly explicit hints'' from the Russians. The Soviet suggestion is that if the United States, as leader of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, were to say publicly that it would consider a statement on nonuse of force, this would provide ''a favorable element'' toward restarting the talks."

In the past 10 weeks, the major companies have again been in a rush to spend billions - but this time to buy up their sister oil companies. Three of the world's largest producers - Royal Dutch/Shell, Texaco and Standard Oil of California - are set to spend $28.5 billion on these takeovers. Although they still spend billions on drilling new wells, not a cent of the staggering new outlay for acquisitions is directly aimed at searching for new reserves.    For the domestic oil industry, the snowballing merger movement marks a major turning point. After the whirlwind decade of the 70's, dominated by OPEC's gyrations, the industry has reached a slow- growing maturity. Domestic reserves are shrinking, prices and profits have weakened, refining and marketing operations are suffering from huge overcapacity."

Weiner, to help him find a market niche and financing.    The partners set up their company in one of Manhattan's manufacturing centers - gritty, loft-lined Hudson Street in the lower West Side.

In St.-Francois in the early morning hours of Feb. 4, an explosion ripped a hole in the Meridien, a leading Guadeloupe hotel, sending visitors, choking on acrid smoke, into the night and leaving an incongruous scar on the gentle tropical landscape. More or less simultaneously, another explosion and fire destroyed a discount department store on the edge of the island's international airport."

Mrs. Klarsfeld said it was the first such assurance from the Paraguayan Government, which she said has protected the Nazi fugitive since his arrival from Argentina in 1960. Survivors say Dr.  Mengele conducted medical experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz and selected new arrivals to be put to death in the gas chambers. He is wanted for trial in West Germany."

Mr. Griffin, who could not be reached for comment last night, is expected to operate the upscale, trendy paper in a lower key and with a new staff.    The current staff said that Clay Felker, the editor, had made a counteroffer, which was rejected by Leonard Stern, the owner, and that as far as the staff was concerned the fate of the newspaper they had nurtured was sealed.    For many weeks, there were reasons to believe that the latest version of the paper could succeed.

Israeli officials indicated that the patrol had been undertaken between Monday night and today.   The Israeli military action came amid signs that President Amin Gemayel was seriously considering another proposal for a political settlement of the crisis here and that it would include scrapping of the May 17 peace accord between his country and Israel, as a previous plan did. Key Christians Oppose Move    Mr. Gemayel has been under increasing pressure from Syria and Syrian-backed opposition groups in Lebanon to break the agreement. Today, however, key pro-Israeli Christian leaders said they would oppose any move to abrogate the accord, further complicating Mr. Gemayel's delicate political position.   The air attacks came at about 10:30 A.M. Ten Israeli fighter jets struck at sites in the Shuf Mountains while other planes circled above them. Syrian antiaircraft guns fired on the bombers, but Israel's Defense Ministry said all planes returned safely.  Beirut radio stations said the Israelis hit sites at Bhamdun and the nearby towns of Ain al Jadida, Bikh Shtay and Mansuriya."

The Tass dispatch from Stockholm, where Mr. Gromyko met with Mr. Shultz, was issued while the five-hour meeting was still under way. It appeared to reflect a prepared statement Mr. Gromyko may have brought with him rather than the substance of the discussion.   The dispatch was characterized by the same criticism of United States policies as Mr. Gromyko's earlier speech at the European security conference. Tass said that, ''from the Soviet side,'' the conversation was ''conducted in a totally frank and principled manner''- implying both that the United States was less than frank or principled, and, in the parlance of Soviet communiques, that the Soviet tone at the session was combative."

A third, he says, ''doesn't know what he's talking about.''   Mr. Grinspun is what Argentines call a person with no hair on his tongue - he speaks his mind in no uncertain terms. That outspokenness is only one of several traits that set the 58-year-old economist apart from many of his more decorous predecessors. He is also only the third Jew ever to hold a ministerial post in this officially Catholic state, a man of humble origins in a position often held by patricians and an unreconstructed politician doing what in the last decade has been mostly a technocrat's job.   Whether Mr. Grinspun's unusual background and opinionated manner will have any impact on the Argentine economy remains to be seen. But clearly some break with the past is required: Mr. Grinspun and the fledgling Administration of President Raul Alfonsin, whose election last October followed eight years of military rule, are facing the worst economic crisis in Argentine history.  ''All the economic variables are out of control,'' Mr. Grinspun groaned in a recent interview.

Wyatt Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Coastal Corporation in Houston, wants very much to acquire a natural gas pipeline company that operates within Texas.   But it looks like he will have to fight very hard to get one.    Mr. Wyatt's current target, the Houston Natural Gas Corporation, would meet his goal better than any other company, analysts say. And so a subsidiary of Coastal is offering to buy 45 percent of Houston Natural Gas's common stock for $68 a share. The $1.28 billion offer, made late last week, would give Mr. Wyatt a controlling interest since Coastal already owns slightly more than 5 percent of the company."

She was referring to the practice whereby brokerages buy such securities, ''strip'' their interest coupons from them and then reissue them as zero coupon bonds. These bonds are sold at a substantial discount from their par, or face, values, with all interest paid at maturity.

However, the suit did not charge Mr. Thayer with any monetary gain from the stock tips. Mr. Thayer called the charges ''entirely without merit,'' but said he had decided to resign so that he could devote all his time to his defense and could save the Reagan Administration political embarassment."

But a senior P.L.O. leader virtually ruled out negotiations with Israel in the near future to try to work out an end to the occupation.   The P.L.O.'s second-ranking official, Khalid al-Wazir, or Abu Jihad, as he is known, said after the King's speech that it was essential that Jordan and the P.L.O. find a ''common basis for political action.'' But he rejected the plan put forth by President Reagan in September 1982 as a basis for negotiations.

Certificates of deposit for up to five years are widely offered, at fixed rates established when the account is opened or at variable rates tied to some external benchmark and that may change periodically until the certificate matures.   Many also offer money-market deposit accounts with rates that move up or down weekly, as well as regular savings accounts, to their I.R.A. customers. Money market interest rates have been ranging from 8.5 to 11 percent. The more often that interest is compounded, the higher the effective annual yield."

Bouyed by the recovery, some companies have lifted hiring freezes on white- collar workers, including scientists and engineers. And according to colleges and employment agencies they are actively pursuing the brightest, most highly trained applicants.   The Reagan Administration's military buildup seems to be fueling the hiring in scientists and engineers; employment prospects in computer sciences are also generally high.   Even in the older nondefense and low- technology American industries, a beleaguered sector that has suffered extensive blue-collar and even white-collar layoffs, there is demand for manufacturing engineers as companies turn increasingly to computer systems and robots to increase productivity. This trend also seems sure to continue, according to the experts."

The change, which affects the way banks account for their reserves, is intended to give the Fed tighter control over the growth of M-1, the closely watched measure of money available for spending.    Actual results may be different, however, since Fed officials have been saying since October 1982 that they are setting monetary policy less according to changes in M-1 and more according to what happens with inflation and the economy as a whole.    In the credit markets, analysts are grinding their teeth because the change could make short-term rates more volatile and make it harder to predict money supply changes and to interpret Federal Reserve policy."

Some suggested that Houston Natural, which as recently as October reported more than $100 million in cash and marketable securities, might respond with a competing offer for control of Coastal."

Consequently, each person confronts somewhat different problems in filling out a tax return. While it is impossible to anticipate all the different situations that may have important tax consequences, some of the more common items are discussed below.     Income Averaging    Income averaging helps taxpayers whose incomes have suddenly taken a big jump, by spreading the higher income over the previous five years, in effect leaving them in a lower tax bracket. To figure out whether income averaging will help lower your tax, add up your taxable income for the last four years. Then take 30 percent of that figure and, if this year's taxable income is at least $3,000 more than that figure, you can profitably average your income.    ''If you can average your income, you should ,'' said Lester Marks, a partner at Ernst & Whinney. ''It is a privilege that will help you.''"

So what if the Administration was submitting a budget with deficits of $180 billion or more for the next several years, coming down, on its own optimistic assumptions, only to $122 billion by 1989?   But, somewhere on the way to President Reagan's opening of his re-election campaign, something happened: Suddenly, the President has decided that deficits do matter, matter enormously.

They are opposing the developer's petition for zoning variances before the Board of Standards and Appeals.   The developer, Paul Milstein, together with Robert Olnick, has proposed a 51-story building for the 64th Street site, a height that is 14 to 20 stories taller than any other building in the neighborhood.

Its existence depends on the 600 white farmers in the district whose land is so highly valued in the good years that most of them are potential millionaires.

Right now, the dollar is showing phenomenal strength. But some economists fear that international confidence will eventually snap, forcing United States officials to push up interest rates again to halt an inflationary plunge in the dollar's value as foreign capital flees the country. If this were to happen, this view maintains, economic growth in the United States would grind to a halt, and with it, the single most powerful engine propelling the rest of the world toward recovery.   Others, however, fear that without a radical change in United States economic policy, the dollar will remain overly strong, gradually bankrupting a big slice of American industry as it attracts cheap imports and prices United States goods out of foreign markets. According to this scenario, it is support for free trade that would then snap as the United States retreats behind tough protectionist measures."

''It will take some sign that the Fed is shifting gears to move the market out of its recent range,'' said James R. Lothian, an economist at Citibank. Although he favors the view that ''the Fed is more likely to move toward ease than tightness within the next month,'' Mr. Lothian acknowledged that confidence in interest rate forecasts is not very strong right now."

Under a more assertive foreign policy being pursued by the Socialist- led Government of Prime Minister Mario Soares, Lisbon is seeking a larger role in world affairs through its former African colonies, especially Mozambique and Angola.   It is involving itself in the tangled search for solutions to armed conflicts, seeking to build up export markets to rectify a dismal balance of trade, and hoping to send off to Africa hundreds of technicians and semi-skilled workers who can't find jobs at home.   All of this comes under the rubric of serving as a bridge - or a ''marriage guidance counselor,'' as one Portuguese diplomat put it - between the two strategically situated Marxist countries and the West, especially the United States."

Without doubt, they all see the bull market continuing into the New Year. But most agree that the market will fall short of its stellar performance of the last 18 months, and that selecting the right stocks is an increasingly difficult task.   Stock prices ''will continue rising in the first half of the year,'' said Steve G. Einhorn, vice chairman of investment policy at Goldman, Sachs & Company. But he added that many stocks have already become ''too expensive'' in relation to their expected earnings, and that the market in general ''holds no promise'' of equaling the broad run-up of the last year."

That is below both the 1.55 million who voted in the 1982 legislative elections and the 1.8 million total that the Salvadoran Government had estimated would vote Sunday.   The American delegation met this afternoon with President Reagan. Afterward, both the House majority leader, Jim Wright of Texas, and Senator Walter D. Huddleston of Kentucky said they were more inclined to support additional aid for El Salvador despite having seen firsthand some ''bureaucratic difficulties'' with ballot boxes and voter lists."

The seven included four American Jews charged with wounding seven Arabs Sunday in an attack with automatic weapons on a bus on the West Bank, and three Israeli Jews charged with trying to plant explosives in January at the Temple Mount, the holiest Moslem site in Jerusalem.   There is no evidence so far, Mr. Carthy said in an interview at his office, that those arrested had anything to do with two other major attacks on Arabs that remain unsolved: the planting of bombs in or near the cars of three West Bank mayors in 1980, and the attack last summer on the Islamic College in the West Bank city of Hebron, which killed three Arabs and wounded 33. Nor was it certain, he said, that they were involved in the recent rigging of booby-trapped hand grenades at the entrances of mosques, churches and Arabs' houses."

Shrewd investors, however, can more than halve their tax liability, or at least delay the payment of taxes without seeing much of their profit disappear. The trick is planning.  Assuming the alternative minimum tax is not a problem, the goal is long-term gains and short-term losses. With exceptions for certain commodities futures, a gain or loss becomes long-term when the security is held more than one year.  Long-term gains are advantageous because they are taxed at a maximum rate of 20 percent. Short-term gains are treated like ordinary income, taxed at a maximum rate of 50 percent."

If past precedent is followed, the selection will probably be described as unanimous.   The reality is likely to be different. Although the Central Committee is established by the statutes as the party's sovereign body between conventions, or congresses, which are held every five years, the actual power lies in two offshoots of the Central Committee, the Politburo, a consultative group that meets once a week to formulate policy, and the Central Committee's Secretariat, the permanent staff that executes policy."

This tax, which is intended to make sure that the well-to-do pay a fair share of the income tax, will strike many more people this year than ever before, including some who may not consider themselves at all well-to-do. Moreover, according to tax advisers who have already made preliminary calculations for their clients, it will strike with greater force.    As Herbert Paul, a New York tax attorney, put it: ''I think the American public is in for a rather disturbing awakening on how many of them are going to be affected by the alternative minimum tax.''    Nonetheless, the impact of the A.M.T., as the device is known in accounting circles, will not be as dramatic as one might infer from the anxious conversations heard in executive suites, at cocktail parties and in first-class sections of airliners."

Mr. Reagan then turned to Mr. Jackson, the 42-year-old civil rights leader and Democratic Presidential candidate who headed a delegation that went to Syria to make an appeal for the flier's release. ''Reverend Jackson's mission,'' he said, ''was a personal mission of mercy and he has earned our gratitude and our admiration.''"

During the week, the commission, headed by Henry A. Kissinger, has made changes in a seven-volume draft report to accommodate objections of some Democratic members, commission officials said.   Although the draft report generally endorses Reagan Administration policy, the officials said, it is now ''less hostile'' toward Nicaragua's Sandinista regime.   Mr. Kissinger met with President Reagan for 20 minutes today to outline ''the thinking and direction'' of the 12- member panel. Officials said Mr. Reagan was advised that there was ''a consensus'' in favor of doubling United States economic and military aid to Central America to roughly $1 billion a year for the next 15 years."

The Minister of Defense, Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, was a colonel and commander of the national guard when the women were murdered. Five men who were in the national guard at the time have been charged with the murders.   The investigation, conducted by a former Federal judge, Harold E. Tyler, concluded that the cover- up began within a day or two of the killings."

Syria also denounced the plan, with the official press agency describing it as a ''trick that has been unmasked.'' (Page 5.)

The billions once spent on petroleum are now staying at home, helping to lift personal incomes and finance purchases of more productive goods.    But for the companies that saw the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries blossom into a major market from 1973 to 1981, the picture is quite different.    Sales of heavy equipment, trucks and consumer goods, to name just a few areas, have fallen sharply in the past year because of the falloff in OPEC oil revenues. Data Resources Inc., which does economic analysis, said those revenues peaked in 1980, when the group's current accounts surplus hit $130 billion."

In more recent years, however, the RCA Corporation has brought little more than disappointment in the form of erratic earnings, paltry dividends and, naturally enough, unimpressive stock action.   The latest blow came earlier this month, when RCA said it would seek shareholder approval for measures to make a takeover of the company more difficult. The shares took another battering, immediately plunging 1 3/4, to 30."

Industry officials say this new job market results primarily from the variety of new plastic consumer products that are increasingly replacing their glass and metal counterparts. With ever-greater skill, chemists are rearranging the loops and chains of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen in plastics not only to create lighter, cheaper, and better protectors of perishables but also to give these materials extraordinary properties: for example, they can be made to conduct electricity or to possess the strength of steel. A surprising amount of plastic is even used in the construction of houses.   This is resulting in such new plastic products as auto engines, tennis racquets, lightweight batteries and packaging materials. ''In five years,'' said Dr. Laszlo Bonis, chairman of the Composite Container Corporation in Medford, Mass., ''you'll hardly be able to find glass or metal in the supermarket.''"

At the same time, the special American envoy, Donald Rumsfeld, conferred with President Amin Gemayel for three hours to brief him on his visits to Syria and Israel and to discuss the prospects of a plan that would disengage the rival militia forces and try to stop the shooting. Mr. Rumsfeld declined to speak to reporters after the meeting, which did not appear to produce any breakthrough on the much-debated plan.   The Syrians appear to have decided to tell their Lebanese allies not to support the plan until the Gemayel Government agrees to abrogate the May 17 Israeli-Lebanese withdrawal agreement - which the Syrians contend gives Israel too much political influence over Lebanon. As a result, there appears to be no immediate hope of putting the plan into effect."

Hussein's call for extra aid at a news conference here Saturday was couched in caveats and conditions. His thrust was clear, however: Jordan needs and welcomes military assistance, but will not become a surrogate military presence for the United States.   Jordanian officials said military aid should be provided not because Jordan would act on behalf of the United States, but because the two nations have an overlapping strategic interest in assuring the security and stability of ''moderate'' Arab nations in the Persian Gulf."

In the short term at least, these people say, the prospect is for increased tension between rightist and moderate elements and possibly between the civilian and military authorities. The danger is that this could lead to increased political violence or possibly even a military coup.    Reagan Administration officials have privately expressed worry in recent weeks that these results were possible, but the Salvadorans interviewed seemed to consider some increase in instability a virtual certainty."

Roberto d'Aubuisson, the candidate of the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance Party, also said he still planned to visit the United States Monday, although he has no visa.   Responding to an article Saturday in The New York Times in which a former Salvadoran military officer linked Mr. d'Aubuisson and other high Salvadoran officials to the death squads, Mr. d'Aubuisson said, ''They are not taking into account that I have been busy the past two years writing a Constitution.''   Mr. d'Aubuisson served as president of the Salvadoran Constituent Assembly beginning in April 1982. He resigned that post to run for the presidency."

The new violence came as Lebanon's political leaders prepared for the opening of talks among Lebanon's warring factions next Monday in Switzerland.   In the meantime, the leader of the Phalangist militia warned that his group would shell Beirut International Airport if the Moslem leadership in West Beirut tried to open it.   The renewed fighting today involved what the Beirut radio called ''an all-out blowup'' along the line separating predominantly Christian East Beirut and the Moslem western part of the city."

The February increase in output by the nation's factories, mines and utilities, reported today by the Federal Reserve Board, indicated the economy was much stronger than many analysts had predicted in December. Last month's production was 15.8 percent higher than a year earlier.   The February increase duplicated the 1.2 percent rise in January, which had been the best since a 1.3 percent jump last September. All figures are adjusted to allow for normal seasonal variations."

The belongings are fairly standard for a pampered member of the ''golden youth,'' the well-to-do offspring of the Soviet elite. But ''khailaifist''?   It turned out, according to the Soviet daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, to be ''high-life-ist,'' a new entry in the ever- expanding, English-derived jargon of Soviet youth that has already enriched Soviet speech with dzhinsi for jeans, dzhaz for jazz, rok for rock, diski for records, kasety for cassette and even striptiz for striptease, shuz for shoes, vach for watch and fazer for father. The English words and phrases are retransliterated from the Cyrillic alphabet, used by the Russians."

It is possible, these sources said, that the Iranians, by combining their remaining regular forces and tens of thousands of raw but eager teen-age volunteers, will be able to pierce Iraqi defenses at some point. But reports from representatives of NATO countries with embassies in Teheran, the Iranian capital, say that offensives appear to strain Iran's limited logistical resources.    Two weeks ago, intelligence sources from these countries said, they expected an Iranian attack involving a quarter of a million men to be made from the hills facing Iraq's Missan Province on the central front. But no such offensive developed, the sources went on, largely because the assembly of such a large force and the needed supplies was beyond the capacity of the Iranian Army."

She said Mr. Kinnock, here on a four- day visit as guest of Greece's Socialist Government, had pledged the support of the Labor Party in efforts to restore to Greece the marble frieze from the fifth century B.C. if and when his party comes to power.   Mr. Kinnock met with the Minister of Culture Thursday. He called the Elgin Marbles ''a moral issue'' and said they should be restored to their place of origin on the Parthenon."

They said the ER-200 Express completed its first round trip Friday traveling at speeds of up to 112 miles an hour on the 440-mile journey. The new train, which carries 380 passengers, travels on a conventional track and tickets cost the same as for the regular overnight sleepers.  "

But a Helen Cohen can come along looking for a way to get back into the work force after having a couple of kids and come up with what might be called a viable concept: Sportswise.    Begun in 1980, Sportswise is the umbrella title for a number of regional six-a-year magazines. Each of them is built around a local calendar of amateur sporting events. Although it hardly seems appropriate healthwise, the biggest national advertising category for Sportswise is cigarettes."

But for the moment, most of the Spanish press and most of the people seem content to think so.    The ceremony was to induct a Chief of Defense Staff, a new position to head the armed forces, and three new Chiefs of Staff for each of the services - army, navy and air force. The change in command structure is to bring it more directly under civilian control and, by lessening the threat of a coup, to make Spain's eight-year-old democracy that much more secure."

Moreover, in random interviews conducted in this huge and crowded black township outside Johannesburg, some residents said they felt betrayed by and disappointed with President Samora M. Machel of Mozambique, regarded by South African blacks as a nationalist idol, for signing the treaty last Friday.   The anger, however, was offset in some cases by a professed sympathy for Mozambique's plight after years of economic decline and attacks by South African-supported insurgents.   The thrust of many comments was that, if the Government was prepared to talk with Mr. Machel, a revolutionary who led nationalist guerrillas in 11 years of war leading to independence from Portugal in 1975, it should also be ready to talk to Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress inside South Africa."

On a visit to Washington last month, the opposition party's parliamentary leader, Hans-Jochen Vogel, carried the message that the Social Democrats' spurning of the American missiles should not be read as a spurning of North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Vogel conspicously left behind in Bonn Egon Bahr, the architect of the party's reversal of a policy it forged when Helmut Schmidt was Chancellor.   Mr. Bahr, one of the Social Democrats' most adventuresome thinkers, has gone so far as to propose the removal of all nuclear weapons from countries that do not possess them, including West Germany.

The figure, higher than the department's estimate of 4.5 percent a month ago, was welcomed by the Reagan Administration but revived concern on Wall Street that continued high growth could result in economic problems later in the year.    These fears were bolstered by findings in the report that net exports of goods and services fell by $5.1 billion in the final three months and that inflation rose to 4.2 percent from 3.6 percent in the third quarter.   Interest rates rose in response to the report, with investors responding to fears that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit availability in response to the continuing strength in the economy. The stock market, sharing those fears, finished moderately lower in slow trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 6.07 points, to 1,148.87. It was the lowest close since April 12, 1983."

But Arthur Laffer won fame, and the devotion of supply-side Reagan campaigners, with a parabolic curve first conceived 10 years ago - the story goes - on a napkin over lunch.     The ''Laffer Curve,'' a simple representation of Mr. Laffer's theory that a cut in the tax rate would eventually increase tax revenues, became the standard for supporters of the Administration's 1981 tax-cut bill. The current recovery, Mr. Laffer now believes, ''is exactly what you would expect to see'' following such a tax cut. ''My view was that it would lose revenues for a certain number of years and then pick up, which it did.''"

It has n't yet. And faced with a tight election-year timetable, it seems unlikely to do so in 1984 either.    But even as concerns about rising protectionism in Congress have faded, American trade policy has nonetheless become more restrictive. The villain, surprisingly, is the executive branch and the President, whose commitments to free trade have been compromised by the politics and legal tangles of Washington. Unless advocates of relatively open markets can mobilize more effective counter pressure, this trend is likely to accelerate. To understand why, it is useful to look back at what happened - and didn't happen - in 1983."

A week ago Mobil declared that it was buying Superior Oil for $5.7 billion. This announcement followed closely on the heels of Standard Oil of California's decision to merge with Gulf Oil, Texaco's takeover of Getty Oil and Royal Dutch/Shell's buyout of the remaining 30 percent stake in Shell Oil.   When President Carter decided to decontrol oil prices, it was with the understanding that the additional billions of dollars consumers would be forced to pay in higher gasoline and heating oil prices would be used by the oil industry to explore for more oil and gas in the United States."

But Mr. Getty, who controls 40.2 percent of the company's stock, joined the rest of the board in voting for the Texaco offer. Pennzoil said it would sue, and the plan must still clear an antitrust review. (Page 1.)

The Slava may be intended to counter United States aircraft carrier battle groups. Her main armament is 16 SS-N-12 surface-to-surface missiles with a range of more than 300 miles.

Alexander M. Haig Jr., who was Secretary of State during that period, said he had ''probably mentioned'' the matter to Mr. Reagan.   Mr. Haig said that because of the sensitivity of the discussions, which were carried out by John Edwin Mroz, a specialist on Middle Eastern and Soviet affairs who now heads a New York foundation, he did not send a memorandum on the matter to the White House, which would have been the usual procedure. Mr. Haig said he felt that such a memo would be disclosed, embarrassing the Administration.   Some officials said the fact that the White House staff was largely kept in the dark by Mr. Haig on a matter of such potential sensitivity as contacts with the P.L.O. was a reminder of the bitterness that marked relations between Mr. Haig and the White House staff. Since leaving office, Mr. Haig has asserted that senior White House staff members repeatedly tried to undermine him."

If you are like most young people you probably can't qualify for a loan - particularly in New York City, where real estate prices have put home ownership out of reach for most first-time buyers.   So what advice can financial experts offer recent graduates or newlyweds who want to sink their small nest eggs into a first house, cooperative or condominium apartment?    While the age of the bargain mortgage is over, they say, there are still ways to better one's chances of qualifying for a home loan - primarily by making the monthly mortgage payment more affordable. But although imaginative financing may lighten the load for a while, such deals in the long run can cost as much or even more than traditional packages."

In a speech yesterday to the United States League of Savings Institutions, Mr. Volcker repeated many of the points he has made before Congressional committees in recent weeks.

And yet, the nation's shipbuilding industry is trying everything from robots to lasers to build them even faster.    It seems to be a paradox. But the shipbuilders say that if they can produce the vessels faster, they can reduce their labor costs - one of the central reasons American shipbuilders cannot compete with their counterparts abroad. By reducing the cost of labor, they may be able to preserve an industry that some of them say is in its worst state since the Great Depression.   Only two commercial ships were ordered built in the nation's 26 major shipyards last year, compared with 43 vessels 10 years ago, according to the Shipbuilders Council of America, a trade group. Although the number of ships contracted by the Navy increased from 7 in 1973 to 27 last year, the shipbuilders say they have not filled the gap left by the loss of nonmilitary shipbuilding."

Then, when they sit down with sharpened pencil and calculator and compute their income tax obligation, they belatedly discover a desperate need to scrounge for angles.     The tax-cutting angles available at this late date are, of course, limited. After all, the tax return covers income and expenses for the year that ended Dec. 31, and any significant tax-saving measures should have been executed before then.    But the tax law does provide time for a few transactions and a multitude of decisions that can save an individual hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars in taxes."

Despite the turnover among S.E.C. commissioners of late (four of us have left our posts in the last 18 months) and the periodic change of leadership in the White House, this aphorism seems still to apply to the regulatory agency whose charge it is to protect the American shareholder.  The Deregulation Myth.  Viewed in the context of its 50 years of existence, the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the chairmanship of John S. R. Shad, has not changed the essential thrust of its policies. Despite some accounts to the contrary, the agency has not been a ''knee- jerk'' deregulator. Of more than 60 major actions taken since June 1981, only 31 involved the removal or lessening of government restrictions, 23 involved the creation of such restrictions, and seven were neutral.  It is impossible to square this record with deregulation as a distinct and paramount goal. This commission's goal, rather, was investor protection. In pursuing that goal, the commission favored the less-restrictive regulatory solution, or the nonregulatory solution. We had a pro- competitive bent. But when competition would not suffice, we were not hesitant to regulate by writing rules to enhance investor protection."

Hundreds of Russians popped champagne corks high into the air, set off firecrackers and sparklers and burst into boozy hugging and dancing. It was a curious sight on the vast square, which is usually given to respectful visits by Russians and foreigners, set-piece parades and hushed queues at the mausoleum.   But then New Year's is a curious holiday on the Soviet calendar - a hybrid of the prerevolutionary Christmas and the Western New Year, a family rather than a state occasion, a national holiday with almost no ideological baggage."

But this suggestion, by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, was questioned by Federal bank regulators. (Page A1.) Argentina is more than 90 days overdue on $650 million in interest payments to U.S. banks, and accounting regulations require the creditor banks to deduct this amount from earnings. But the banks had expected the repayment delays and do not expect their stocks to be depressed further. (D6.) Argentine officials said they expected to reach a settlement over the arrears by mid-April. (D6.)    Common Market nations again failed to settle differences over finances and farm subsidies. Britain, which wants a refund on its contribution to the European Economic Community's budget, again found itself standing alone against the nine other members. (A1.)"

Mr. Volcker's message was, in essence, ''cut the deficit before it's too late.'' While the Fed plans to orchestrate continued steady growth for the economy, he warned that it could not be expected to loosen its monetary policy to block a deficit-induced rise in interest rates, which could easily bring on another recession. The chairman added that Congress and the Administration would have to cut up to $125 billion in the next two years to make any substantive progress. As a result of his warnings, the stock market plunged and it appeared that Wall Street suddenly became concerned about the $200 billion annual deficits. So adverse was the reaction that Mr. Volcker took pains on Thursday to note that his comments had been ''a little blown up'' and that markets had overreacted."

It suggests, as does Senator Metzenbaum, that such mergers will reduce the capital available for drilling, national drilling rates and our nation's ability to find more oil.   It is not clear, however, that increased drilling rates, such as occurred following the quadrupling of oil prices in the 1970's, leads to the finding of much additional oil. We analyzed United States oil drilling and oil discovery rates from 1946 to 1978 - using yield per effort techniques borrowed from fisheries analysis - and found a strong decline in yield per effort, from 33 to 7 barrels of oil found per foot drilled (Charles Hall and Cutler Cleveland, ''Science,'' Feb. 6). Our results agree with the predictions of Hubbert and Davis made decades earlier based on physical analysis techniques, and do not support the many statements made by various economists and representatives of industry that increased monetary incentives would increase oil finding rates. Of somewhat greater surprise, we found that less oil was found per foot drilled, relative to the downward trend over time, during periods of greater drilling, and the converse. During that approximately 30-year time interval there was no indication that increasing or decreasing drilling rates had any particular influence on the total quantity of oil found in a year, which tended to decrease over time regardless of drilling rates."

But as seen by a range of Reagan Administration officials, Yuri V. Andropov's death offers not so much a chance for breakthroughs as a time for gestures that might lead to breakthroughs later on.  There is little evidence that anything fundamental has changed in either Moscow or Washington with Mr. Andropov's passing. Essentially, the same people have been running Soviet foreign policy for five or six years. Mr. Andropov was ill for almost one year of his 15-month tenure. His predecessor, Leonid I. Brezhnev, seemed inactive for his last three years. Soviet policy has been much the same throughout.    Nor is there much evidence that President Reagan is prepared to propose new compromises that might help break the impasses over the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan or the Lebanon situation or the talks on nuclear arms. All that can be seen thus far is a softening of the Reagan oratory on Soviet-American relations in the last two months."

Adolfo Calero Portocarrero, leader of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, which is the largest of the rebel groups and is estimated to have as many as 8,000 men under arms, praised the report of the Kissinger commission. The commission, headed by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, indirectly endorsed United States aid to Nicaraguan rebels and the pressure to negotiate that the commission said the rebels were putting on the Sandinista Government."

''Gold investments are in the form of bullion for personal trust accounts and in North American mining stocks for the institutions,'' the money manager said.

Earlier this month, the California authority sold $1 billion of notes and bonds to help finance construction of electric power lines connecting power plants of the Intermountain Power Agency in central Utah with cities in southern California.   The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service frown on purchases of high-yielding Treasury securities by local authorities who have just sold tax-exempt bonds at lower interest rates, but such buying is permissible within limits."

Libyan troops, in conjunction with Chadian rebels under the command of former President Goukouni Oueddei, have been in control of the northern third of Chad since August, when they seized Faya-Largeau and Fada."

THATCHER CALLS FOR DEBATE ON WELFARE STATE,"   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that Britain was sitting on a ''social-security time bomb'' and that she therefore felt it essential to reconsider the whole web of public benefits built up since the end of World War II.   Excepting only some system of basic pensions and a National Health Service of some kind, though not necessarily like the present one, she argued that it was time to begin a public debate on the structure and financing of the welfare state. She said she was looking for ''as many views and disapassionate assessments'' as she could obtain.   The Prime Minister's comments were certain to provoke criticism from the opposition Labor Party, which enacted many of the public benefits into law and defends them fiercely. But she said it was no use for her political and press foes to shout ''scandalous'' every time she proposed change. ''It would be absolutely scandalous if seeing these great problems coming I do nothing about them now,'' she said."

The banks said they sought the plan in case the company became ''unable to access the public securities market for any significant period.''   The move appeared to reflect growing uneasiness in the financial community over whether Seabrook 1 will ever be completed. It came only a day after the company yielded to pressure from its consortium partners by conditionally agreeing to scrap Unit 2 if they will meet its demands.

Reading of the layoffs in the American steel industry during the recent recession brought them back to me with the bittersweet nostalgia of a good childhood remembered with almost painful clarity.   Our home in Bethlehem on East Fourth Street was on the right side of the tracks, but just barely: Just beyond our back fence were the tracks of the Lehigh Valley Rail Road. Three blocks away was Bethlehem Steel. My mother's housekeeping chores included a daily assault with dustcloths and a monthly wash of all the curtains."

Analysts and industry executives said the early-March figures showed that sales could be expected to remain strong for the remainder of the model year.    The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold 211,240 cars in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last, when they sold 160,617.   The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate was 8.1 million domestic units in the period. Most analysts had expected sales in the first quarter of about 7.5 to 7.8 million domestically produced units, but an 8.3 million rate for the month of January and an 8.5 million rate in February caused some to revise their forecasts for the year and brought about some minor adjustments in production schedules by the manufacturers for the second quarter."

Father Agostino, a 74-year-old monk who was christened Agostino Saccomano, is one of four Benedictines who remain who were at the monastery on Feb. 15, 1944, when Allied bombers dropped over 450 tons of bombs on the abbey.
