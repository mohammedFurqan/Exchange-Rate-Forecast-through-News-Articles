Financial stocks, being sensitive to interest rates, helped pace the market's advance, with PNC Bank, Comerica and Barnett Banks among the gainers. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 23.67 points, to 5,689.45, fueled by oil stocks. For the week, the Dow was up 8.14 points. But with many technology stocks off, the Nasdaq composite index slipped 1.04 points to close at 1,1133.65. $(Page 36.$)    Treasury bond prices gained for the first time in a week, as traders took the slide in housing starts as a sign of a slowing economy that should bode well for keeping interest rates down. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32 , to 9928/32 , as its yield fell to 6.76 percent from 6.80 percent. But the yield was up 7 basis points for the week. $(39.$)    Western Resources Claims Victory   Western Resources claimed a victory in its $1.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Kansas City Power and Light, saying Kansas City Power shareholders rejected a plan to buy out Utilicorp United. The votes have yet to be counted, however, and Kansas City Power was not conceding defeat. A triumph, it is believed. would be the first successful hostile takeover of an American electric utility, and analysts predicted it would lead to more. $(37.$)    Directors of IES Industries, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, rejected a $1.17 billion buyout offer from MidAmerican Energy and approved a sweetened offer to merge with two other utilities, WPL Holdings of Madison, Wis., and Interstate Power of Dubuque, Iowa. $(35.$)    New Rules for Commuter Planes   Commuter aircraft, under rules taking effect today, will have to fly farther behind jet airliners when approaching or leaving airports to reduce the risk of crashes.

Simpson trial and a $1 million advance to write a book about the case. But Mr. McGinniss, best-selling author of ''Fatal Vision,'' quit the project, citing a lack of anything new to say about the case. The 53-year-old writer plans to focus on his true passion: European soccer. He thus loses a two-book deal with Crown Books, and must forfeit a total advance of $1.75 million. $(36.$)    Coke Aces Pepsi in Venezuela   Coca-Cola raided Pepsico's long-time partner in Venezuela, heating up the global cola war between the two American companies. In what analysts viewed as an embarrassment to Pepsi and a blow to the company's international expansion plans, Coca-Cola announced that it had formed a joint-venture company with the Cisneros Group, a Pepsi bottler for five decades. Pepsi, contending it had a contract with Cisneros until 2003, vowed to fight. $(35.$)    Crude Oil Price at 3-Month High   Crude oil rose to its highest price in almost three months -- $22.60 a barrel for September delivery, up 70 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange -- reflecting optimism that demand is robust enough and stockpiles lean enough to absorb the oil that Iraq is expected to start exporting next month. $(32.$)    Dollar Rises Against the Mark   The dollar rose to 1.4918 German marks, from 1.4854 marks on Thursday, bolstered by growing speculation that the Bundesbank will reduce interest rates when its policy council meets on Thursday. $(32.$)    Indians Raising Capital Abroad   Government institutions like the State Bank of India, under increasing pressure from India's leftist parties to halt sales of public-sector companies to foreign investors, are finding novel ways to raise capital abroad while sidestepping criticism. $(34.$)  "

The increase, which was somewhat brisker than expected, was driven by increases for food and vacation lodging.     Consumers meanwhile increased their spending at retail counters a scant one-tenth of 1 percent for the month, following a revised June decline of five-tenths of 1 percent. Neither report, analysts said, fundamentally altered the economic outlook. The core C.P.I., which does not include food and energy, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent. $(Page D2.$)    The price report spooked the bond market, which had a sharp selloff.

The owner of the Liberty Media Group and TCI Communications Inc. reported a loss of $184 million versus a loss of $95 million last year. $(D5.$)    Wal-Mart Profits Rise 11.5 Percent   Wal-Mart earnings rose 11.5 percent, to $706 million, in the company's second quarter as sales grew by 12.3 percent.

But the practice among physicists of observing a phenomenon, creating a testable hypothesis, then sometimes elevating that hypothesis to a named law has become a popular hobby in other fields. For example, the laws of motion in physics have been joined by the laws of markets in economics.         And as information technology and computer science have risen to prominence  in the economy, they have given rise to a few laws of their own. These lie somewhere between the laws of physics, which are not all exactly true, and the laws of economics, which are not all exactly false. Einstein showed that Newton's laws were false, except for practical purposes. As for the various laws of economics, we can expect one to prove true any day now, but don't hold your breath."

New Government data showed that the economy created 193,000 jobs in July, a somewhat slower rate than during the spring, pushing the unemployment rate for July up slightly, to 5.4 percent of the civilian work force, from 5.3 percent in June. Also, upward pressure on wages ebbed last month. Consumer spending fell during July for the first time since winter, and orders to factories fell in June for the first time in four months. $(Page 1.$)    Prices of Treasury securities surged in response to the positive economic news, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond to a four-month low of 6.73 percent. $(45.$)    Economist Links Jobs and Yields   The monthly employment report seems to have a greater effect on stock and bond markets than any other single piece of economic data. In a study to be released on Monday, Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton University economist, measures the correlation between the interest rate on the 30-year Treasury bond and job creation. $(37.$)    Wage and Health Bills Passed   Lawmakers, rushing toward a monthlong recess, resoundingly approved bills to raise the Federal minimum wage by 90 cents, to $5.15 an hour, insure safer drinking water and make health insurance portable between jobs. They then sent the agreements to President Clinton for his expected signature. $(1.$)    It's Still the Economy   More than any other issue, the economy was Bill Clinton's ticket to the Presidency four years ago. With the country struggling to climb out of a recession, Mr. Clinton campaigned as the champion of the ''forgotten middle class.'' Now he is basing his re-election campaign on a much improved economy. $(1.$)    Democrats contend that Bob Dole's tax-cutting package, expected Monday, is based on overly rosy economic predictions. The Dole camp sees its numbers as far more credible than the Democrats' assumptions. $(9.$)    World Bank Studies New Role   Taking the first step to stimulate the flow of billions of dollars in private capital to the developing world, the World Bank effectively set aside $250 million to start a new fund to guarantee new investment in poor countries against expropriation and other political risks. James D. Wolfensohn, the bank's new president, reasons that private investors would be willing to lend far more money to the developing world if their investment could be insured. The bank's executive directors like the idea, but final approval awaits a detailed plan. $(36.$)    Ford Ordered to Pay Sanctions   Ford Motor was ordered by a Dallas judge to pay $10 million in sanctions to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit related to a fatal car crash. The judge accused Ford of ''wrongful and abusive conduct'' during pretrial proceedings. $(37.$)    Steroids, a Black Market Success   Whenever the Olympic Games take the world stage, accusations about the use of performance-enhancing drugs are sure to follow. But world-class athletes -- if they take the drugs -- are not alone. An estimated 500,000 Americans, mostly young, white and male, spend $400 million a year in the black market on synthetic steroid hormones to improve their sports prowess -- or just to show off their brawn. Separately, there is a legal, medical market in the drugs. $(45.$)    Dollar Falls Slightly   The dollar ended slightly lower, settling at 1.4750 German marks, down from 1.4762 marks on Thursday, and 106.89 Japanese yen, down from 107.13 yen. $(38.$)    Heating Oil Futures Rise   Heating oil futures prices rose sharply to 58.71 cents a gallon, as traders worried about a possible winter shortage. $(38.$)  "

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.2 percent, or 68.58, to 5,838.52, eclipsing its May 22 record of 5,778.

This long-brewing controversy has pitted owners of domain names afraid of losing their names against trademark owners who contend that their marks are being compromised. And both sides now are clamoring for someone to do something. Someone, in this case, is Internic, an organization serving as the registry for the most recognized categories of Internet domains: .com, for commercial enterprises; .edu, for educational institutions; .net, for organizations that run networks, and .org, for research and nonprofit groups. Internic has registered some 400,000 names in these domains, first-come, first-served, since it was founded in 1993 through an arrangement with the federally backed National Science Foundation.          Last year Internic began charging registrants $50 a year for each name registered. Previously, Internet name disputes were rare and, invariably, had been settled cooperatively. But as commercial interest in the Internet increased, domain-name speculators and trademark lawyers descended like locusts. Speculators staked out names of well-known companies and products and began selling them back to the companies themselves. Trademark holders began sending threats to holders of domain names that came close to, or matched, their trademarks. If the domain holders didn't relinquish, the trademark owners often  would sue -- even if the trademark was for Acme Plumbing, say, and the registered name holder's business, Acme Bakery, was unrelated. And if threats didn't work, many trademark holders were also happy to threaten Internic. ""Their lawyers say, 'We'll sue everyone, including you,' "" said Grant  Clark, corporate counsel for the Science Applications International Corporation, which owns Internic and the company that operates it, Network Solutions Inc. According to Internic, such threats have forced it to assume that it will be sued in such circumstances -- despite the fact that Internic lawyers say it has  never performed, nor does it intend to, any kind of trademark search or verification before issuing a domain name. To deflect some of its perceived liability, Internic adopted a name-dispute policy that appears to favor trademark holders. The policy so infuriated holders of existing domain names that the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public policy group, is actively seeking pro bono counsel to file a class action suit against both Network Solutions Inc. and the Federal Government. It's not clear how much of an effect such a suit might have. Although Internic's name registry was formed with the blessing of the National Science Foundation, Internic has no known legal authority. It was given its responsibility by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, a clearinghouse chartered by the influential Internet Society and the Federal Network Council to coordinate how domain names are linked to the physical locations of computers on the global network. In any event, one worrisome feature for groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a contract that Internic requires domain-name applicants to sign.  The contract says they must agree not to sue Internic over a name dispute. And in the event of a dispute, they must post a bond to cover Internic's legal fees. The amount of the bond, according to a lawyer for Network Solutions, could be little or nothing if the company is not named in the suit, though if the company is named, it would be higher. Another concern is that Internic overwhelmingly favors trademark owners over those with registered domain names. A trademark holder must simply inform Internic of a registered trademark that predates the registration of an Internet domain name and contend that the duplication is causing confusion or harm. These two conditions are sufficient grounds for Internic to start a dispute proceeding against the existing holder of the domain name. At the end of 30 days, the name ""goes dark,"" or is taken off the network pending an agreement between the name holder and the trademark owner. Going dark, of course, could put a network provider, or anyone who conducts business on the Internet, out of business overnight. One such unresolved dispute involves the domain name ""sylvan.com,"" registered with Internic by Kayvan Sylvan, a software consultant. His domain name is being  challenged by Sylvan Learning Systems Inc., which sells franchised educational services. If Mr. Sylvan and the company are unable to settle the dispute in the allotted time, Internic will take the ""sylvan.com"" address off the Internet until the matter is finally resolved. Internic contends that its only alternative would be the dubious one of waiting for Sylvan Learning to slap it with a lawsuit for contributing to a trademark infringement. The logical solution to this industry problem would be to indemnify Internic from trademark liability so that name disputes could be settled directly between the parties involved, through existing trademark law. Such legal protection would have to come from the Federal Communications Commission or from Congress.  Mr. Clark, the lawyer for Internic's corporate parent, said he would be ""ecstatic"" if Congress granted his organization immunity from lawsuits accusing  it of contributing to trademark infringement. ""It would put an end to the need for the dispute policy,"" he said. Even Internic's biggest detractors agree. By whatever means, ""Internic needs to  get out of the business of deciding who will have their domain name taken away,"" says Carl Oppedahl, a lawyer who had sued Internic on behalf of clients who wanted to challenge its dispute policy. ""If a trademark owner doesn't like a domain name, it should go to the courts. Existing trademark law applies to the Internet, just like it does to toothpaste brands in stores.""         "
