Chernenko, calling him ''an outstanding leader of the party and the state'' and noting that relations between the two Communist nations had improved ''noticeably'' in the 13 months that Mr. Chernenko was in power.     The official News China News Agency, reporting swiftly on developments in Moscow throughout the day, followed close on the heels of Western agencies with its reports of Mr. Chernenko's death and the choice of Mikhail S. Gorbachev to succeed him as General Secretary of the Communist Party. But the agency's brief biography of the new Soviet leader gave no hint of the official reaction here to his designation.    However, there were indications last year that Peking already viewed Mr. Gorbachev as the likely successor to Mr. Chernenko. His visit to Britain in December received close coverage in the Chinese press, and Chinese leaders were said to have quizzed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about him when she arrived here to sign the agreement on the reversion of Hong Kong a few days after meeting Mr. Gorbachev in London."

Icahn. Phillips, characterizing Mr. Icahn as a ''notorious takeover entrepreneur and greenmailer,'' is fighting the bid every way it can - with a new recapitalization plan, for example, and a ''poison pill'' that would require Mr. Icahn to pay as much as $1.5 billion above his original $8.1 billion bid. But Mr. Icahn, indicating he just might swallow the poison pill, continued to lock horns with Phillips. Analysts say that Phillips, still recovering from a bid by T. Boone Pickens just two months ago, may be too weak to fight for long, and may soon have to find a friendly suitor.          Stocks continued a wild ride, with Big Board volume surpassing 100 million shares a day every day last week. The Dow Jones industrial average had a relatively lackluster performance - ending the week at 1,289.97, up 12.25 - but other indexes gained. Some analysts believe the Dow is falling out of step amid investor enthusiasm for stocks in other sectors and on other exchanges."

It also scaled back its planned production of what it called a ''sporty compact'' line, but said it would upgrade the line of P-cars to take them out of the low-cost end of the market. This new strategy represents Chrysler's yielding of the low-cost market to its Japanese partner, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation."

Even allowing for high commercial rents, hundreds of independent pizza shops have been thriving here, with high sales volume in very little space and profits that can reach 80 percent a pie.    More important, the city's pizza entrepreneurs, unlike their counterparts almost everywhere else in the country, have not had to compete with the fast-growing, well-financed chains that have come to dominate the national pizza picture.    But now that part of the idyll seems to be over. The third largest of the national chains, Godfather's Pizza, has established a beachhead in Manhattan and is already planning to expand. The second largest, Domino's Pizza, is close behind, and Pizza Hut, the largest, may be heading to Manhattan as well."

Among other qualities, leaders have an overriding faith in themselves and their own ability to succeed - a faith that may defy the practical odds, in fact. And with this faith, leaders seem to be characterized by a higher degree of ego development than that of the average person. Yet, successful managers do not attain the highest order of ego development - which may be just as well for their corporations.    A recent study that I conducted illustrates these points. Despite the many demographic differences among the 70 managers that we studied, a striking 95 percent of them were in what we call the post-Conformist stage of ego development. In most social groups the majority, or a large minority, of people are at a less advanced level, the Conformist ego stage. But what does this finding mean in terms of how these leaders work and why they succeed?"

But not every worker in the private sector will get a lift on payday. The biggest pay raises on average this year will go to nonunion labor, a trend that began in 1982.   B. K. Atrostic, an economist with Joel Popkin & Company, Washington-based economic consultants, expects nonunion wages and salaries this year to inch up 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent in 1984. But union workers' pay is expected to rise only 3.8 percent, compared with 3.9 percent in 1984. Neither group will receive wage increases that match the expected 4.8 percent inflation rate.  Miss Atrostic offered several reasons why nonunionized workers are expected to move ahead faster again this year.  ''The industries most severely affected by Government deregulation, such as the airlines, were heavily unionized,'' she noted. ''The strong dollar also cost unionized jobs and forced workers to accept wage freezes or pay cuts.''"

But so intense is the interest in engineering that college and university faculties have failed to keep pace with the sharp increase in students, and some authorities fear this shortage of teachers may mean a decline in the quality of electrical and computer engineering and computer-science graduates.   An indicator of the strong demand for skilled technical graduates comes from the American Electronics Association, based in Palo Alto, Calif., which predicts an annual growth rate through 1987 of 10.6 percent for electrical engineers, 16.5 percent for computer engineers, and 15.2 percent for computer-science professionals.  Other groups make similar forecasts. The National Science Foundation, for instance, predicts a growth of 10 to 15 percent in jobs for electrical and computer engineers and a substantial shortage of computer-science professionals.

In the past the Administration said it would try to influence currency levels only when markets were ''disorderly,'' but after meeting with a group of finance ministers, Mr. Regan said a second guideline is to be ''helpful.'' A joint statement from the meeting reaffirmed that the leading industrial nations would ''undertake coordinated intervention in the markets as necessary.'' Treasury officials said this was more a warning that they would intervene if speculation continues than a threat of imminent action. (Page A1.) The dollar fell modestly before the statement was issued, on conjecture that the ministers would act to restrain its record-breaking climb. Gold rose $3.35, to $307.15, in late trading in New York. (D11.)         Stocks ended mixed again, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 1.99 points, to 1,228.69, but with more shares advancing than declining.

In the midst of an economic crisis, the arrival of Ethiopian Jews and a national debate over the question of withdrawing troops from Lebanon, Israel's religious parties have again introduced a bill in Parliament that would amend Israel's Law of Return to redefine who is a Jew.   The proposal has prompted a storm of protests from American Jewish groups that oppose the amendment because it would invalidate the Jewishness of anyone who converted through a ceremony performed by a non-Orthodox rabbi - meaning rabbis of the Reform and Conservative Jewish movements.        Would Affect Some Decendents    The amendment would also bar recognition of those converted by Orthodox rabbis not recognized by the Israeli rabbinical authorities and would apply as well to the descendants of anyone who was converted by non-Orthodox rabbis."

His promises to revamp industry, eliminate corruption and forge a new national unity stirred hope even among the cynical in India.  But this week, the results of the latest parliamentary election brought India back to some familiar realities. Instead of the 80 percent electoral sweep he scored in December, Mr. Gandhi and the Congress (I) Party won 57 percent of the seats at stake in state legislative elections that were held in 11 of India's 21 states and one union territory.    More sobering was the fact that the party failed to make inroads in the opposition areas of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, where two charismatic Chief Ministers are now in an improved position to challenge Mr. Gandhi. The party also fell sharply behind its 1980 showing in the heavily industrial state of Maharashtra and even in Uttar Pradesh, in the Hindi- speaking heartland that has long been its power base."

Under the agreement reached by Mr. Shultz with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko last week in Geneva, the two sides agreed to hold talks on space weapons, strategic arms and medium- range missiles.

Not since the Vietnam War has there been such heavy demand for weapons. The Reagan Adminstration has been progressively increasing budgets for military hardware since it arrived in Washington four years ago, and the Pentagon, for its part, has been working overtime to help contractors overcome their reputation for gross industrial backwardness and woefully inefficient production.     Yet, after four years of Pentagon nurturing and Reagan Administration budgetary largess, a dizzying procession of highly publicized cost and quality fiascos has left the industry's image more tarnished than ever. Why, critics ask, can't the industry find a way to remedy its mistakes and stop wasting billions of taxpayer dollars?    There is a litany of woes. The explosion earlier this month of a Pershing 2 missile in West Germany, which killed three American soldiers when its motor caught fire, shocked Europe. Eight governmental units are investigating the Navy's nuclear submarine building program, looking into allegations of multi-million dollar abuse. Other inquiries are focusing on possible illegal overcharges at Ford Aerospace and kickbacks at Hughes Aircraft. The armed services are rejecting shoddy products from military contractors at an unprecedented rate, including fighter jets from McDonnell Douglas, missiles from Hughes Aircraft and semiconductors from Texas Instruments. And cost increases and cost overruns persist, with inflation in the defense sector running 2 percentage points above the overall inflation rate."

The Government's recently released LIFO department-store price index, on which retailers base their year's inventory evaluation, has come in at the lowest level in at least six years.    This means that, since companies adjust the cost of their inventories based on the inflation rate reported by the Government at year-end, their earnings improve if the inflation rate is lower than expected. In the year just ended, the LIFO index for retailing came in much lower than generally expected. As a result, many retail companies in the next few weeks will report higher income in the final quarter than they expected and probably have to pay less taxes."

Moreover, the Soviet Union has no vital interest in the Southwest Pacific and has paid little attention of any kind to the region.  Yet in the last few days United States officials have treated a refusal by New Zealand's Prime Minister, David Lange, to permit a port visit by an American destroyer as a major foreign policy crisis, as a matter of ''grave concern,'' and an event meriting possible economic retaliation against New Zealand's lamb, wool and butter exports.

That is the first commandment according to Sir Michael Edwardes, Britain's best-known doctor for ailing corporations. It is important to act before a situation ''solidifies around you,'' he explained in an interview last month. ''You really only have a matter of months to set the direction.''    But even for Sir Michael, the recent pace has been unusually rapid. He had scarcely settled in as chairman of International Computers Ltd., Britain's largest computer maker, when that company was taken over last summer. Sir Michael was soon appointed chairman of Dunlop, the troubled tire and sporting goods manufacturer, but by early this month he had received a takeover offer from BTR, a rapidly expanding industrial conglomerate, that was too good to refuse.   With Dunlop sold, no one expects the 54-year-old Sir Michael to continue nursing the company much longer, even though his employment contract has more than two years to run. Speculation is widespread that he will soon succeed Ian MacGregor as head of Britain's strike-weakened National Coal Board, despite Sir Michael's public denial of reports that he has discussed the job with Government representatives and Coal Board officials. Through his closest advisers he has let it be known that he would be more interested in private-sector employment."

Australia, New Zealand and the United States are members of a 34-year old South Pacific alliance known as Anzus.    Australia's unwillingness to associate with the testing of the missile coin cided with a decision by New Zealand's Prime Minister, David Lange, not to permit an American warship to pay a port call to his country because of his Labor Party Government's antinu clear policy.

Random checks of polling places by journalists indicated that the voting patterns varied, with some districts reporting a turnout below 20 percent and others well over 50 percent.    It thus appeared that the political opposition to President Zia ul-Haq had fallen short of its goal of keeping the turnout below 10 percent.    General Zia, who has said he would be satisfied with a turnout of 40 percent, has promised that, with the election of a National Assembly and of provincial assemblies, he would relinquish some of his powers and eventually lift martial law, which he imposed in 1977 when he took power in a coup."

Its pacts with these ideological foes, hailed at the time as a breakthrough in regional diplomacy, seem to have brought few and ambiguous benefits to those nations with which South Africa concluded the accords.    In the last week, Angola, Botswana and Zambia have complained in varying degrees of what they say is South African aggressiveness, and South Africa has responded caustically to some of the complaints.   Reports from Mozambique, meanwhile, indicate there has been a widening of an insurgency that the Marxist authorities in Maputo hoped to end by signing a nonaggression pact with South Africa last March. On Tuesday, for the first time, a ranking Mozambican official directly accused South Africa of flouting the accord."

IF the 1960's were the Age of the   Conglomerate, as the decade has   often been called, then the Textron Corporation was the father of an age. Throughout the 1950's, right through his retirement in 1965, Royal Little, Textron's now-legendary founder, bought and sold companies at a breakneck pace. He transformed Textron, once a textile manufacturer, into the nation's first and most widely emulated conglomerate, with businesses ranging from helicopters to lawn mowers to buzz saws.   ''I'd just get it in mind to do something,'' Mr. Little, now 89 years old, said the other day, ''and I'd go ahead and do it.''    But times have changed. Takeovers are difficult and costly - and often unnecessary, many believe. Analysts and academics no longer revere the Royal Littles, Harold Geneens and other conglomerateurs who bought and sold companies on a whim. Today, conglomerate stocks often sell below what their subsidiaries could command as stand-alone units. The 1980's have become the Era of Synergy, in which conventional wisdom dictates that corporations limit their acquisitions to companies that complement their core businesses."

She can also start drawing the money before he retires. And even if her husband has remarried, she may still arrange to receive survivor's benefits if he dies before retirement.   Under the new law, a long-standing conflict between state law, which had been fairly liberal in permitting the award of all or part of a husband's pension to his ex-wife, and Federal law, which had been more restrictive and often prohibited such awards, has been cleared up. Now, as long as the divorce decree or separation agreement meets several key requirements, a woman can be awarded a claim against her ex-husband's pension."

The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency estimated that the weapons part of the Soviet military budget had increased by 5 to 8 percent from 1982 to 1983, the last year studied, and said preliminary signs pointed to another increase in 1984.    The C.I.A., basing its estimate on what one official called ''a little more cautious'' forecast of how fast the new weapons would roll off the assembly lines, said that Soviet weapons spending rose between 1 and 2 percent in 1983 and that it was too early to tell about 1984."

Some writers hailed the speech as heralding a new golden age for Chinese literature.    But a description of the new charter that was issued today by the official New China News Agency indicated that it retains strictures about writers remaining faithful to the party and to Marxism-Leninism. In effect, the party seemed to have loosened its controls as it has on earlier occasions, but to have retained broad ideological constraints that could be invoked against any writer venturing too far."

ABC, CBS and NBC were perceived as monolithic entities, beyond the ordinary tides of business. But since early this year - when assorted interests cast acquisitive eyes on CBS - a sense of impending upheaval has been growing in the industry. And yesterday, when Capital Cities Communications Inc. moved to take control of ABC, the unthinkable happened.     The question now confronting ABC executives is whether the surprising new arrangement with Capital Cities will signal a dramatic change. The role of momentum in the fortunes of a network is crucial. When things are moving forward and up, they tend to stay that way for a while, sometimes for years. The problem that has to be faced is whether ABC's recent slide in audience ratings will be temporary or sustained. Has success during the last eight years made the network sluggish? Can it bounce back?    Network spokesmen say that it can. They point to new series such as ''Eye to Eye,'' which has its premiere Thursday, and several multimillion-dollar mini-series, including a drama special dealing with the Vietnam War years in this country, which are well along in the planning stage."

The prolonged ascent of the dollar has baffled even the members of the Reagan Administration and has aroused a new ambivalence about how to deal with it.    The dollar's long climb from its depths of 1980 confirms the validity of the Administration's economic policies, they say, but it is causing immense dislocations in the politically important sectors of the economy most affected by it, especially exporters, and undermines the ability of developing countries, such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, to make payments on their dollar loans.    For Europeans, as for the Japanese, the strong dollar has brought a boom to exporters, but in pushing up the cost of the goods they import from the United States and other imports that are priced in dollars, especially oil, they fear that the dollar will push up the inflation rates, undoing years of austerity meant to bring them down."

The agreement was signed in Amman on Feb. 11 by King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O.   The text of the accord, distributed in English and Arabic in the Jordanian capital, specifies five principles upon which their ''bid for joint action'' should be based. A key provision includes ''total withdrawal'' by Israel from ''the territories occupied in 1967 for comprehensive peace as established in United Nations and Security Council resolutions.''   Jordan's Acting Information Minister, Taher Hikmat, said at a news conference in Amman today that this meant the P.L.O. had accepted United Nations Resolution 242, which calls for recognition of Israel's sovereignty and borders in exchange for the return of occupied Arab lands."

The rebound was a continuation of the better conditions that became apparent Monday afternoon when prices rose enough to end the day unchanged to slightly lower.    Government securities dealers said investor demand was fair to good for the $7 billion of new five-year notes auctioned yesterday by the Treasury, but said demand for longer-term issues remained weak as many investors remain convinced that interest rates will trend higher this year.    At the 1 P.M. auction, the new 11 3/8 percent Treasury notes due May 15, 1990, sold at an average yield of 11.43 percent. Several participants said demand for the new notes was very strong at a yield of 11.43 percent or higher. By late in the day, prices had improved enough so that the new notes were offered with a yield of 11.37 percent, down from 11.40 percent a day earlier. The 11.43 percent average yield was higher than the 11.02 percent average for similar notes sold last November, but well below the 13.93 percent yield for five- year notes sold in May 1984."

The survey of 80 large chemical companies found that thousands of tons of cancer-causing agents and other very hazardous materials are being released into the atmosphere from hundreds of factories. There are no uniform standards to control the emissions of most of the substances, the study's directors said, and some of the materials are subject to no regulations.   ''No government agency has ever attempted to gather this information, and the information we received is not reassuring,'' said Henry A.

They are easily the most complex machines coming out of major computer manufacturers, university laboratories and now even Silicon Valley start-up companies.  They are supercomputers, machines that can run circles around the quickest mainframes now made.   But supercomputers are in short supply, and so is the highly specialized talent used to design and operate them. ''The best number I've heard is that there are about 250 people in the United States who really understand the monsters,'' an executive of one of the nation's largest mainframe manufacturers said recently. ''And there's probably about an equal number of companies bidding for them.''   So acute is the shortage, in fact, that the Federal Government has stepped in. Last month the National Science Foundation said it would provide at least $200 million to create four supercomputer centers around the country, each equipped with a different kind of machine. The stated goal is to make the computers available to researchers for everything from designing airplane wings to simulating what happens to an automobile as it crashes."

The stepped-up assault on organized crime, many believe, has permanently altered the relationship between the Mafia and the people of this Mediterranean island at the southern edge of Italy.    Magistrates, politicians, church leaders and ordinary Sicilians who express this view do not play down the importance of recent police breakthroughs, notably the confessions of a former Mafia leader, Tomasso Buscetta.   Nor do they argue that the war on the Mafia has been won. Indeed, some Sicilian authorities contend that in certain respects, the Sicilian Mafia is more powerful than it was a decade ago."

A variety of changes has been made in all of these areas for 1984 tax returns.    Taxpayers who do not itemize deductions, for example, will find generosity rewarded with a bigger deduction for charitable giving.    Changes were also made in itemizing deductions for medical expenses. These changes will disappoint people who spent large amounts on over-the- counter drugs but will benefit those who traveled to a far-off medical clinic for treatment. A recent court decision also should help some taxpayers who do not want to file an insurance claim but still want to claim a medical expense deduction."

The exporters demonstrated, after all, that the country's worst economic crisis in decades could be overcome with good, salable products and hard work. As a result, the Brazilians were held up as models to other Latin American nations being urged to cover their huge foreign debt payments by earning more from exports.   Brazil's achievement was impressive. A record $13.1 billion trade surplus fueled a 4.4 percent growth rate last year - the first expansion of the economy since 1980 - and supplied the dollars necessary to meet interest payments on the country's $102 billion foreign debt. It seemed the worst was over for Brazil."

On Nov. 26, a bomb exploded under a car near the embassy, killing a Colombian woman but not harming any Americans."

But a personal computer can ease the task of preparing taxes to the extent that the taxpayers using it understand how the tax laws apply to their particular returns.

New York City, which has turned its last 20 years of garbage into the highest peak on the Eastern Seaboard, in a Staten Island landfill that will soon run out of space, is preparing to spend $2.5 billion on the construction of eight trash-to-energy plants, and billions more to operate them.   San Francisco and neighboring municipalities recently agreed to the construction of a $200 million plant that will burn hundreds of tons of garbage a day and produce 40 megawatts of electricity. In the meantime, since they have filled nearby landfills, they haul their refuse 57 miles.    From the burgeoning population centers of Florida to the sparsely settled reaches of Alaska, North American cities are finding that burning their wastes and selling the energy as electricity or steam is cheaper or healthier than operating dumps.

Billions of dollars worth of old bonds are candidates for refinancing, and investors should not expect to hold until maturity bonds with a coupon, or stated interest rate, two percentage points or more above current interest rates for similar issues.    ''We expect one of the major 1985 developments to be companies redeeming high-coupon issues and either retiring them or, more likely, refinancing,'' said James R. Stork, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, a Chicago-based subsidiary of the Security Pacific Corporation that specializes in credit analysis.    Techniques of refinancing vary from issue to issue, but the aim is usually the same - reduce interest expenses by replacing high-interest bonds with low-interest bonds. Corporations benefit because reduced interest expenses mean higher profits, and local governments and agencies benefit because lower interest costs mean more money for other uses or maybe even lower taxes."

Although the company failed to capture the hearts, minds and wallets of the computer-buying public, the Otrona did deliver some unique software.   An accessory program called Valet allowed you to call up an appointment calendar, telephone directory and other on-screen aids without having to switch out of the main program, say word processing, that you happened to be using at the time.   Valet vanished, ahead of its time, but now programs reminiscent of it are all the rage - so much so that 1985 is apt to go down in microcomputer history as the year of desk management software.

Mr. Sprinkel's appointment may enhance a renaissance of monetarism that is already apparent at the Federal Reserve Board. Monetarism is about all that is left to the Administration following the failure of the supply-side economists to show that large tax cuts would eat away the budget deficits and the subsequent failure of more conventional conservatives to show that the deficits portended soaring interest rates and another recession."

He means to consolidate the conservative revolution in public policy - he calls it a Second American Revolution - that he began four years ago.    In fact, the Reagan revolution, which he suggests is a reprise of George Washington's, is meant to be the counterstroke of the Roosevelt revolution of the 1930's. Where Franklin Roosevelt sought to overcome the problems of the Depression by increasing the economic and social role of the Federal Government, Ronald Reagan has attacked ''stagflation'' - that combination of stagnation and inflation that dogged the economy in the 1970's - by cutting the role of Government and by relying increasingly on what he calls ''the magic of the market'' to generate strong economic growth.    To date, Mr. Reagan's economic policies look like a striking success. The economy's performance was a major - perhaps the major - factor in the President's landslide re-election, and that victory has emboldened him to stay the course he began in 1981. As he envisions that course, a free-market economy, with steady growth and low inflation, will emerge from the changing tax system, from the deregulation of major industries and from cuts in long-standing Federal subsidies in many areas, including agriculture, housing and medical care."

They got a break on capital gains. The amount of time investors need to hold stocks or other assets for profits from their sale to be eligible for preferential tax treatment was reduced to six months and a day from one year and a day.   At the same time, however, Congress sharply restricted the capital gains that can be taken on bonds bought at a discount, and it put new limitations on the deductibility of interest on money borrowed to purchase bonds.    The reduced holding period for capital gains applies to assets acquired after June 22, 1984. So investors who purchased assets soon after that date and sold them in late December will be the first beneficiaries of the change and the only ones to benefit from the provision on 1984 tax returns."

Such an economic contraction, in turn, adds to the already- bloated deficit as unemployment pushes upward again.    Our recent research, however, leads us to be skeptical of this orthodox approach, and to conclude that a tax increase would at worst be only mildly contractionary - and at best could even generate stronger growth."

In a 75-minute presentation to a rapt and occasionally boisterous House of Commons, Mr. Lawson proposed more limited income tax cuts than the Government had projected last autumn and ignored pressures to initiate a major spending program to combat Britain's record unemployment. But Mr. Lawson promised to cut the cost of creating new, low-salaried jobs and extend work training programs for youths.    The move to encourage new jobs by the elimination of the salary ceiling on which British employers pay a 10.45 percent national insurance tax, was the biggest surprise. That move will make it more expensive to employ higher-salaried workers but is expected to generate more than $910 million toward a program to reduce the insurance charges for lower-salaried workers and the self-employed. The overall effect is intended to encourage small entrepreneurs and make it cheaper for large businesses to hire unskilled workers."

In prosperous West Germany, the anniversary evokes pain, embarrassment and ritual expressions of a distant guilt. The phrases ''zero hour'' and ''collapse'' are much in use to fix the date in the imagination - as if to say the Nazi enterprise, however evil, led, after all, to the collapse of a unified Germany, the sundering of the fatherland. It is a rare and bold West German politician who says openly it was a good thing the war was lost.   By contrast, in spartan, Communist East Germany the official mood is one of shrill enthusiasm. This month an entire front page of Neues Deutschland, the party daily, was filled with a bannered summons to start observing ''the 40th anniversary of the victory over Hitler fascism and the liberation of the German people.'' May 8 has been proclaimed an official holiday."

Since Mr. Kirkland made that remark, lawyers on both sides of the labor-management struggle have squared off over his suggestion that unions would have far more success organizing workers if both labor and management were to use their raw economic might, rather than the N.L.R.B., in trying to overpower each other. That was the situation that existed before the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.    Mr. Kirkland's thought is that labor, by using such techniques as secondary boycotts, which the N.L.R.B. moves quickly to stop, would be able to pressure more companies into recognizing unions."

In itself, the magnitude of the threat to the financial system posed by Gov. Richard F. Celeste's closing of 71 Ohio savings and loan institutions appears to have been vastly exaggerated. It is a much smaller threat than that resulting from the near- collapse of the Continental Illinois Bank. Where Continental Illinois had some $35 billion in deposits, all 71 Ohio savings associations have only about $5 billion in deposits. The Federal Reserve can supply all the liquidity the Ohio thrift institutions need to get through by putting up less than $250 million, where Continental Illinois, at peak, needed nearly $9 billion."

In recent months, however, several blue-chip giants and scores of small new companies have adopted bylaws that allow for unequal voting rights. For example, one class of common stock, usually controlled by management, may allow 10 votes per share, while another class, owned by nonmanagement investors, may have just one vote per share or perhaps no vote at all.   This trend has caused the New York Stock Exchange to rethink its 59-year-old ''shareholder democracy'' rule that calls for delisting companies that authorize two classes of common stock with disparate voting rights. As the Big Board seems ready to loosen its rules as part of the heated competition to keep and win listings, corporate lawyers, members of Congress and Securities and Exchange Commission officials are debating the legal, managerial and economic implications of the move away from shareholder democracy."

All her life she had lived in the East - Virginia, Massachusetts, New Jersey - and she wanted to sample the Western life-style. ''I didn't want to deal with 'Silicon Valley,' with its high cost of living and its congestion,'' she recalled, so she picked Portland, Ore. Six months ago, Miss Gleason began work at the Lattice Semiconductor Corporation in Portland, and she delights in both the job and the location.   Miss Gleason's journey, and the contentment she has found at the end of it, reflect the increasing high- technology opportunities in cities around the nation like Portland, Atlanta, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia - even New York.    The best-known technology centers, like Silicon Valley in northern California and Route 128 near Boston, continue to dominate the public mind. But as more and more cities and states try to reorient their economies from smokestacks to computers, a second tier of cities is becoming important in technology research and production. These locations spawn their own offshoots, and in time there is a critical mass that feeds on itself and generates more and more jobs. So an employee is no longer bound into one job and one company, but has good prospects at other companies in the same city."

John Paul's announcement last Friday, on the 26th anniversary of the summoning of the Council by Pope John XXIII, stated little more than the Pope's desire to set aside two weeks to ponder the changes brought about by the Council. At the least, the timing of the synod - it is to end on the 20th anniversary of the close of Vatican II - is seen as an expression of the Pope's sense of drama and occasion.   Given the vague description of the synod, Catholics across the theological spectrum reacted with reserve. Many see it as a potentially valuable review of the Council's work but too brief a session to entail further change."

Late tonight, less than 12 hours before he was to receive the sash of office, the 75-year-old President-elect, Tancredo Neves, underwent emergency surgery for an acute intestinal inflamation, and doctors said the surgery was successful.    With dozens of foreign delegations in town, congressional leaders said the inauguration would take place as planned, with the elected Vice President, Jose Sarney, temporarily occupying the presidency. Mr. Neves's unexpected operation - doctors said they had hoped to postpone surgery until after the inauguration - temporarily switched attention from the difficult legacy that he will inherit to the more immediate question of his health.   But the incoming Government's principal challenge lies in the continuing economic threat to Brazil's stability. Mr. Neves, who was chosen by a 686- member Electoral College last January, has defined his challenge as ''the very difficult task'' of simultaneously fighting inflation and recovering traditional rates of economic growth."

Planning Plant Conversion,"   The General Motors Corporation said it would spend about $105 million to convert a major part of its former Oldsmobile division manufacturing complex in Lansing for assembly of a new front-wheel-drive car, possibly as early as 1987. G.M. said conversion of a part of the plant, which now builds rear-axle cars, would result in temporary layoffs for about 500 workers, beginning in June or July.   The plant had previously been scheduled to close in June, but Robert Stempel, a G.M. vice president, said a labor agreement reached last month aimed at improving productivity was a ''major factor'' in the decision to convert it for car assembly. G.M. declined to give details of the new car to be built."

Profits fell for the first time in eight years in 1983, then rebounded by 12 percent last year.

Church officials had hoped the Pope would clarify his position on liberation theology, a doctrine that encourages the poor to take political action to improve their lives and that has its roots in Latin America.    The Peruvian Bishops have been split over whether the doctrine should be condemned. Some say it dangerously uses Marxist analysis and stresses political rather than spiritual liberation. Supporters say the theology only deals with the lives and struggles of the poor as reflected in the Gospel."

As a result, its earnings performance has been poor since 1982, and analysts do not see much improvement before 1986. In the fiscal year 1984, ended July 31, Datapoint earned $26.4 million, or $1.29 a share, on $600 million in sales."

A Federal judge in the Southern District of Florida issued a temporary restraining order against Jose L.

The judge, Jose A.

Today's action is the latest twist in a complex financial debacle that began with the March 1 closing of E.S.M., a securities firm based in Fort Lauderdale. The closing led in short order to the collapse of an Ohio savings and loan.

The Hartford-based toy manufacturer said it was selling off its inventory of Adam systems, only 18 months ago one of the promising entries in the chaotic home computer industry, and would post a ''substantial loss'' for the fourth quarter and the year. Analysts speculated yesterday that the company could take a write-off of as much as $75 million, before taxes, and would report a loss for the year of perhaps $55 million.   Nonetheless, Wall Street cheered the move as overdue, and Coleco's stock surged on the Big Board in heavy trading. It closed at $14.375, up $2.25.

As evidence against Mr. Barbie is assembled by the investigating magistrates and the charges against him are pared down, it has become clear that the trial will deal with three specific charges, instead of the eight originally announced.  The three charges exclude Mr. Barbie's role in the arrest and death in 1943 of Jean Moulin, the underground chief, and the Nazi police official's campaign of repression against French Resistance fighters.   If lawyers' evaluations are correct, the case against Mr. Barbie, who is 72 years old, will concentrate on about 800 of his Jewish victims, offering a microcosm of a beastly system rather than a confrontation with the Nazi mechanism on its widest, most brutal scale."

But it was so broadly worded that it became increasingly popular as the basis for private civil lawsuits.

First, such attempts at financial engineering of the marketplace are an inexact science at best, economists say. Especially in the last few years, with the dollar having defied the standard influences on its movements, it is difficult to know what will affect it, and by how much."

''I think we have tremendous philosophic differences and I know he doesn't want me as chief executive of the company, so I don't think it would be worthwhile for me to stay,'' Mr. Smith said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Milwaukee.    ''At this point I think it would be best if I exercised my contract and left,'' Mr. Smith said. Under the terms of his contract with Pabst, Mr. Smith, who is 49 years old, can collect more than $560,000 if the company is taken over. He said he did not know how soon he would leave the company after formally submitting his resignation, adding that he has no definite plans for the future."

George Scharfenberger, the chief executive officer of the City In vesting Company, for instance, has made finding tax-saving deductions his hobby. He often spends his free time poring over tax materials, and tells friends that he does not consider his weekend complete unless he has figured out a new way to save on his taxes.    ''The key is I keep meticulous records of everything,'' he said, adding that he files information on four personal computers, one for each of his residences.    But even for those who are not prepared to devote such time and effort to the task, there are a number of easily employed tactics to reduce tax bills, from using income averaging where appropriate to setting up a special trust that allows beneficiaries to be taxed at a lower rate."

Bankers are concerned because the court rulings could require them to pay F.D.I.C. insurance premiums on billions of dollars of letters of credit they have issued for businesses or as backing for bonds and other securities.   The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, hearing a case stemming from the July 1982 failure of the Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma, found on Dec. 27 that the bank's letter of credit backed by a promissory note fulfilled the legal definition of a deposit, and was therefore backed for up to $100,000 by the F.D.I.C.   The Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Northern Division, reached a similar conclusion last October in a case in which Jacob F. Butcher used a letter of credit from the United American Bank in Knoxville, Tenn., to back his bid to buy the stock of another bank. Mr. Butcher, who was then chairman of the United American Bank, has since been indicted for bank fraud in other transactions."

Swedenborg, the 18th-century mystic philosopher, considered such theories, and mulled over the idea that Sweden was the original Garden of Eden. His contemporary, Olof Rudbeck, insisted that Atlantis, no myth, never mind the cold, had existed right here at home, the light of the universe, the hope of mankind."

Under pressure to reduce the Federal budget deficit, and irked by some luxury car dealers who were advertising tax benefits as if they were standard equipment on new models, Congress applied the brakes to business deductions claimed for cars used more for personal pursuits than business. It also applied similar restrictions to computers.    Professionals and businessmen motoring around in new luxury sedans or sports cars will also discover the Federal Government is no longer as generous a benefactor in helping subsidize the extra comfort and style with tax breaks.    ''If the car you bought was an expensive car, you're going to find the tax benefits reduced, and if you don't use your car or computer more than 50 percent for business you're going to find the tax benefits reduced,'' said Robert M.

Areas of Achievement    ''The Japanese companies generally outperformed their American counterparts in terms of quality products, the absenteeism rate, the relationship with workers and their relationship with customers,'' said Martin K.

The Court's decision of Nov. 26, 1984, finding that it has jurisdiction, is contrary to law and fact. With great reluctance, the United States has decided not to participate in further proceedings in this case.        U.S. Policy In Central America    United States policy in Central America has been to promote democracy, reform and freedom; to support economic development; to help provide a security shield against those - like Nicaragua, Cuba and the U.S.S.R - who seek to spread tyranny by force, and to support dialogue and negotiation both within and among the countries of the region. In providing a security shield, we have acted in the exercise of the inherent right of collective self-defense, enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Rio Treaty. We have done so in defense of the vital national security interests of the United States and in support of the peace and security of the hemisphere."

Analysts credit Del Webb's chairman, Robert K. Swanson, with rescuing the company from a brush with bankruptcy in his first year as chief executive, in 1981, and putting it on an increasingly sound footing by reducing its exposure to hard times in construction and gaming.

The rebels have not been able to take and hold a single Nicaraguan town. But the country's economy is in bad shape and Sandinista leaders say the rebels are to blame for that. They say the rebels' war of attrition has forced the Government to take measures restricting civil liberties in defense of national security.    The restrictions include the reimposition of press censorship, which is applied especially vigorously to the major opposition daily, La Prensa; the limits on campaign activities preceding the elections last November, and the recent orders preventing some opposition leaders, such as Arturo Cruz and Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, from entering the country."

The network reportedly extended to the office of the Prime Minister and to the Defense, Commerce and Finance Ministries.   The Western diplomat said Friday that officials in the Defense and Finance Ministries were shaken by the extent of the network, which purportedly sold military, economic and other Government secrets to diplomats from the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany and France. Many officials were ''lying low,'' he said, and were apparently unwilling to make major decisions while the spy ring continued to unravel."

The program has two objectives, according to Sandinista officials here and Western diplomats in Managua who specialize in military matters. The first is to deprive the rebels of material support and intelligence by removing relatives and neighbors sympathetic to them from war zones.   But equally important, these sources said, is the creation of ''free-fire zones'' where the Sandinista People's Army can operate freely against the rebels."

Mr. Bryan, whose union has 12,000 members and is the largest at Eastern, said in a telephone interview: ''I'm extremely disappointed.

But the outcome of the voting for regional councils on Sunday, in which the conservative and centrist opposition made clear advances, has not clarified a second area of conjecture about the country's political future. It is that France could be moving into a period of institutional instability, something it has not known since the Fourth Republic and the days in the 1950's before the presidency of Charles de Gaulle.     Because the victories of the opposition in the local elections dovetail with polls on the electorate's intentions for the 1986 legislative voting, they make a strong case that Socialists will be unable to retain power alone. Yet the results suggest a series of potential circumstances that in a year's time could raise the question, who governs France?"

The order came as the Israelis imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on southern Lebanon in the sixth day of what Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel called an ''iron fist'' crackdown on Shiite Moslem-led resistance to the occupation.   ''Journalists who will attempt to arrive from Beirut and from other areas in Lebanon which are not under I.D.F. control will not be allowed to cross into areas where the I.D.F. is currently deployed,'' the Israeli General Staff said in a letter hand-delivered to the Tel Aviv bureau of The Associated Press to be relayed to journalists here. I.D.F. stands for Israeli Defense Forces.    ''Recently, I.D.F. checkpoint commanders have been issued strict orders to prevent the crossing of journalists from the north into areas in the south under I.D.F. control.'' the letter said."

The company is now willing to pay $28 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American grade, which is among the lowest levels for a major producer.   Texaco is the first partner in the Arabian-American Oil Company, which includes the big companies that produce Saudi Arabian crude oil, to cut its posted price to $28. Other partners, such as the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation, still post a price of $29 a barrel. The cuts in posted prices put pressure on the official oil prices of Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries."

The company's million-dollar promotional effort in the business and advertising trade press is aimed at erasing any lingering doubts about its integrity - doubts that appeared in the wake of tax-evasion charges brought against its founder, William B. Tanner.    Mr. Tanner sold the company, then called the William B. Tanner Company, in late 1982 to Media General Inc., the giant communications concern. He was indicted in 1983 on three counts of income tax fraud and one count of mail fraud related to his activities at the company, particularly in the way he handled its accounting procedures. He pleaded guilty to the four counts on Jan. 31, and will be sentenced later this year."

Computers can handle incomprehensible amounts of information at dazzling speed, but they are, for all intents and purposes, hopeless at doing several things at once. Somehow, they have to sort out an order in which to handle each piece of information.   Although the computer's sequential approach works wonderfully on some problems, and acceptably on many more, many computer designers concerned with building the super information processors of the future - sometimes known as fifth-generation computers - believe that the path to a real breakthrough is through systems that operate more like the human mind. Their jargon for simultaneously handling several problems, or several parts of one problem, is ''parallel processing.''"

Senior Israeli officials said they responded to Mr. Urquhart that the Lebanese and Syrians were completely out of touch with the reality of what Israel intended to do. They warned that if Lebanon and Syria did not take control of the areas Israel plans to evacuate by Feb. 18, there would be chaos and killings between the Lebanese religious and political groups - for which the Israelis said they would not be responsible.   Mr. Urquhart, who spoke here after visits to Damascus and Beirut, met separately with Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir to brief them on his conversations with Syrian and Lebanese leaders, and heard essentially the same response from all three, Israeli officials said."

Bryan, president and general chairman of the machinists union at Eastern Air Lines and a director of the company, has not had much time to celebrate the fact that on an operating basis the fourth quarter was the carrier's most profitable ever.    Instead, he has been deeply involved in a pivotal round of negotiations that will decide whether or not Eastern will continue to exist. But unlike a year ago, when Mr. Bryan was instrumental in pursuading his membership to accept sharp pay cuts in return for stock ownership, he says that the current round of talks may produce a different result."

The city has had little success in arranging any coordinated relocation to that area, but there have been some individual moves. The latest, and one of the biggest, is now under way.   Special Additions Inc., a large manufacturer of maternity clothes, is keeping its offices and showrooms on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. But it is moving its cutting and shipping operations from the West Side to a 78- year-old restored factory building in the Port Morris section of the South Bronx."

The disclosure contradicts a repeated assertion by William L. Brown, chairman of the bank, that the reason for the bank's failure to comply with the currency reporting requirements was that it was unaware of them until 1984.   Earlier this month the Bank of Boston pleaded guilty to failure to report $1.2 billion in cash transfers with Swiss banks from 1980 to 1984 and was fined $500,000, a record amount.        Chairman's Remarks on Filing    Mr. Brown said at a news conference on Feb. 11 that the bank had simply failed to notice the regulations in the Federal Register, and he said that in June 1984, ''as soon as we had determined that these reports were required to be filed, we did so.'' To underscore his point, Mr. Brown held up a copy of the Federal Register showing how many regulations it contained and how small the print was."

In an abrupt half-hour digression, the witness, Grzegorz Piotrowski, a former captain, said that once when the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the pro-Solidarity priest he is charged with murdering, was released from a day's detention ''I saw adult men cry like children.''   He also affirmed that he had told pretrial investigators ''there would be no trouble in obtaining volunteers if he issued a call for police willing to maltreat the activist clergyman.''    This segment of testimony centering on the defendant's charge that the Government was soft on the church and that political authorities tied the hands of the secret police made it appear at times that it was the murdered priest and even the Minister of Interior, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, who were on trial rather then Mr. Piotrowski and three other dismissed employees of the state security department that monitored religious groups and minorities."

Investors often wait until the last minute before committing funds at major Treasury financings, and their normal caution has been increased recently by concern that interest rates will rise later in the year, even if the Fed holds monetary policy stable in coming weeks.         Federal Funds Below 8 1/2%    A slight decline in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to less than 8 1/2 percent helped raise prices slightly yesterday.

Despite the erratic swings in the currency market   this week, exacerbated by the statements and interventions of central bankers, the general view of traders and bankers around the world is that the ''fundamentals'' have not changed and that a steep downfall of the dollar is not imminent.    Those fundamentals include United States advantages over other major countries, such as a more dynamic economy, lower inflation, higher after-tax real returns on capital, a positive spread in interest rates, the size and diversity of the capital market and the nation's political stability, which makes it a safe haven in turbulent times.       Those are the factors, optimists say, that have attracted such a huge influx of foreign capital, and nothing has happened to change them.

The company was not seeking a life preserver in case the then-thriving video arcade games business collapsed.   But collapse it did. And today, Robert E.

In fact, such an opinion provides the public with reasonable assurance that the representations of management reflected in the company's financial statements comply with generally accepted accounting principles.    Some members of Congress have raised questions about the ability of the profession to properly oversee its members. In truth, many of the criticisms of individual auditors are unfounded, and the profession remains fully capable of assuring that the highest standards of fairness, integrity and objectivity are maintained."

That amounts to a staggering $1,421 per person, according to figures released Wednesday by the Commerce Department.   Lured by the rising dollar ; ich makes them cheaper, and by robust American demand for all kinds of goods, imports surged 26.4 percent last year, to $341.2 billion. The rise was almost across the board: low technology as well as high technology, capital goods as well consumer goo s.    Japanese cars, Mexican oil and French wine were all among the imports. They improved the American standard of living by holding prices down - but at the cost, at least in the short term, of American jobs."

There has already been a noticeable increase in the past few days in attacks on the Israelis and the local militia forces they set up, most of them in territory they will still be holding after they pull out of the area around Sidon.   The Israeli Government, tired of the disastrous occupation because of the incessant ambushes made largely by militant Shiite Moslems, decided on the withdrawal plan over sharp internal objections.   But if the major goal is to cut down the attacks and the casualties, the withdrawal from Sidon will present several new problems, according to diplomats in Beirut, Western military sources, Lebanese factional leaders and others familiar with the area."

It was a highly unusual move for a company that for years towered well above its competitors. But the meaning was clear: After years of profits so fat that they immunized the $30 billion American pharmaceutical industry against economic downturns, the big drug companies have suddenly found themselves mired in the same sort of troubles that have plagued less-glamorous industries for years. Spiraling imports, legislative changes and new competition at home and abroad have struck hard. And with new blockbuster products harder and harder to come by, America's supremacy as the world's premier maker and seller of prescription drugs could be in jeopardy.    ''The pressure is on us, if we're going to survive at the growth rates we had in the past,'' said John J. Horan, chairman of Merck & Company, one of the world's pacesetting pharmaceutical houses."

RELAXING RULES ON USE OF CARS FOR BUSINESS,"   Under pressure from business people and Congressional leaders, the Internal Revenue Service announced today that it was relaxing its record-keeping requirements for some taxpayers who drive company cars or drive their own cars on business.    Under the new rules, many people who use the cars only incidentally on personal matters would not have to keep detailed ledgers documenting each trip.  Salesmen and others who drive partly for business and partly for other reasons would still have to keep careful records.

''They said the reason we won the contract was that we had the highest-priced product,'' said Charles J. Aschauer, an executive vice president at Abbott. Concerned that health-care costs were skyrocketing to unsustainable levels, Mr. Aschauer remembers how uneasy he felt about the stated reason for his company's victory. ''When you saw that happen, you knew something had to give someday,'' he said.   And indeed it did - with a vengeance. The nation's health-care industry is now being rocked by a revolution, begun in late 1983, that is drastically changing the way Americans are being treated for everything from cataracts to hardening of the arteries. And nowhere is the economic fallout more visible than in the hospital-supply business, which is groping for ways to dig itself out from one of its worst years on record."

Mr. Reagan was referring to recent reports that the Government had been moving residents out of their homes in the north of Nicaragua, where fighting has been under way between Government troops and United States-backed rebels. The object, according to Sandinista officials and Western diplomats in Managua quoted in the reports, is to deny the rebels material support and intelligence from sympathizers, and to allow the creation of ''free-fire zones'' where the army can operate without fear of harming civilians.    The President, speaking here before a group of about 100 merchants, businessmen and others from Central American countries, also charged that the Sandinista Government had attempted to ''dwarf and bully'' its neighbors."

This simple gospel has been spreading in recent years at many of America's best known companies, such as I.B.M. and General Motors, have recognized quality's competitive potential.   The proponents of this new doctrine begin with the idea that most companies incur large and unnecessary costs because they fail to do things right the first time. A manufacturing process that is error-free would avoid a multitude of expenses. Efforts to reduce manufacturing defects and to improve product reliability will almost invariably lead to a reduction in a company's costs. It is in this sense that quality is said to be free."

But a host of new tax rules were rung in with the new year, and those who take steps now may be able to save money by maximizing the benefit - or minimizing the damage - caused by the changes.    The flurry of new rules were enacted in last year's tax act and various other laws dating back to 1981. Among the January moves: the Internal Revenue Service raised the interest rate on underpayments to 13 percent from 11 percent, so taxpayers' mistakes will now be more costly. Following is a rundown of some other recent regulatory changes that are of interest to individual taxpayers."

The appeal came in the aftermath of what American officials have characterized as an Iranian defeat in a weeklong offensive.    Administration officials conceded that the chances of Iran's yielding to American and other international pleas were minimal, but one senior official said, ''We have to keep trying and hoping that the sheer numbers of Iranians killed on the battlefield will persuade Khomeini to try another tack.''    Iraq has repeatedly agreed to accept a United Nations cease-fire and negotiation, but the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran has refused to do so until President Saddam Hussein of Iraq resigns and Iraq agrees to pay reparations. Partly because of Iran's refusal to negotiate unconditionally, the United States has been publicly sympathetic to Iraq and critical of Iran, even while officially professing neutrality in the war."

Americans alone are expected to buy 10 million to 12 million of these machines in 1985, up from 7.3 million last year.   At this stage, investors wanting to capitalize on the V.C.R. craze are limited to a few companies that specialize in the production or distribution of the movies, what the industry calls the ''software.'' The machines themselves, the ''hardware,'' are manufactured by such major electronics companies as the RCA Corporation and the Sony Corporation, and V.C.R.'s contribute only a small portion of their revenues and profits. Consequently, V.C.R. sales have a relatively small impact on these companies' stocks."

Uncertainty about the pace of economic activity has been building among market participants for two weeks, as reports from February on key components, such as industrial production and retail sales, have sent conflicting signals to traders and have caused bond prices to lurch up one day and then down sharply the next.    Signs of weakness are apparent, but analysts say that growth remains solid and that a further rise in bond yields is almost certain by midyear.    Richard Green, president of Money Market Services Inc., an economic information service concern in Belmont, Calif., said that ''the market got a little excited about the softness in the February data we have seen, but now it is beginning to reassess that prospect, and bond prices will be subject to downward pressure for at least the next two months.''"

The poison pill is an increasingly popular defense against takeovers. Though it can take different forms, the basic strategy involves a company giving its stockholders the right to buy shares at a special price, or get other benefits, when a hostile bidder tries to take over the company - making such a takeover prohibitively expensive, or ''poisonous,'' for the would-be acquirer.    The defense, and the phrase, emerged in the course of Lenox Inc.'s 1983 battle to fend off a takeover by the Brown-Forman Distillers Corporation - although Lenox ultimately decided to dissolve its pill and accept a bid from Brown-Forman. Still, most takeover experts see the poison pill as a perfectly effective preventative: No company that has adopted the pill has ever had to use it."

The Catholic conference, which consists of about 285 Roman Catholic bishops in the United States, said its opposition to the missile was based on these two considerations: ''the potentially destabilizing impact of this weapons system on the nuclear arms race,'' and ''its cost, viewed in light of pressing human needs here and elsewhere in the world.''

''There isn't any economist in the world who can do that and accurately tell you what you're going to need down the road,'' he said.    The requirement that the Administration make long-term budget projections stemmed from the October 1967 report of the bipartisan Presidential Commission on Budget Concepts, on which key members of the Johnson Administration, Congressional leaders and private economists and budget experts served.       Concerned about inflationary pressures from the Vietnam buildup of military spending and the rise of Great Society spending programs, the commission, responding to the urgings of business and other groups, decided that the inability of Congress and the public to see the distant consequences of present decisions was a major weakness of the budget process."

''Ten years ago, many us thought that merit would be recognized and rewarded in these fields regardless of a person's gender, but we've been proved totally wrong,'' said Betty Vettor, Executive Director of the Scientific Manpower Commission, ''I don't expect opportunities to equalize within the next twenty years,'' she added.  Still, Dr. Vettor and others point out, women have been making inroads into scientific, engineering and computer fields. Between 1965 and 1982 (the latest year for which figures are available), there was a 10 percent increase in the number of women majoring in the physical and life sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer science, according to ''The Professional Women and Minorities'' report of the Scientific Manpower Commission. On the graduate level, the growth was somewhat higher: a 12 percent increase in master's degrees and a 15 percent increase in doctoral degrees.  These increased percentages do not, however, point to a change in women's preferences about career fields, according to Sue E. Berryman, a resident consultant with the Rand Corporation in Washington, D.C.  They simply reflect the growing representation of women in all fields in college.  ''As long as girls expect to assume the major child-rearing responsibilities of their families, they will be less likely than boys to choose quantitative occupations that require major educational and labor force commitments,'' said Dr. Berryman, who conducted the study, ''Who Will Do Science?'' for the Rockefeller Foundation."

To the extent that the credit and stock markets are a barometer of society's confidence in the future, lower interest rates and higher stock prices suggest that the outlook is brighter than it was four years ago.    As to the future, economists and investors are quick to warn about the perils of huge budget deficits, but few forecasters expect any quick or dramatic changes in the financial markets.   ''With short rates steady, long rates are not likely to vary much,'' said Mitchell J. Held, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Deficit reduction talk, favorable inflation prospects and pockets of weak economic numbers'' could encourage some drop in note and bond yields, he said, but those impulses should be offset by ''strong economic growth'' and worries that short-term rates will trend higher later in the year."

In better times, the program had been a continuous chatter of transactions being announced in the shorthand of company names and share prices.    ''But by last year,'' explained Ramon Gonzales, an executive at a big Manila brokerage house, ''it was mostly just long periods of silence.''    Reflecting the economic troubles and political uncertainty in the Philippines, the Manila stock market - composed of two exchanges, the Makati and the Manila, which trade the same issues - may well have been the worst-performing market in the world last year."

General Rogers also said he believed the European allies were paying an ''equitable share'' to build up NATO forces, and he urged Congress not to pressure the Europeans for more military spending by threatening to cut American troops there.   The general's remarks, in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, came as some members of Congress are bracing for a re-examination of NATO's military operations."

Mr. Mubarak came to Washington promoting a plan by which the United States would meet with the Jordanian- Palestinian group as a preliminary step toward eventual talks between it and Israel.   According to American officials, Mr. Mubarak advocated that plan forcefully, arguing that if Washington would stop refusing to deal with the P.L.O., this could encourage P.L.O. hard- liners to agree to talks with Israel.   But Mr. Reagan repeated to Mr. Mubarak that the United States would not talk to the P.L.O. before it unequivocally accepted Security Council Resolutions 242 of 1967 and 338 of 1973. In the recent agreement with Jordan, the P.L.O. accepted ''all'' Security Council resolutions, but some of its leaders subsequently condemned Resolution 242, which calls on Israel to give back land occupied in the 1967 war in return for secure and recognized borders."

Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional director of the bureau, attributed the rise to dramatically increased costs of fruit and vegetables, medical care and women's clothing.   Produce prices, which increased 4.7 percent, rose the sharpest. Although increases in the prices of produce are common in winter months, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, cold weather in Southern states, particularly Florida, helped account for the higher prices."

Environmentalist groups opposed to the Koeberg plant, 20 miles north of Cape Town, expressed concern about the shutdown, but the South African Electricity Supply Commission said the problem was not serious.   ''We could probably have run for years with these faults and nothing would happen,'' a spokesman for the commission said."

Shultz and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko was in the end as much a foreign policy signal as it was a starting point for arms control.  As detente unfolded in the early 1970's, arms control negotiations led the way. As the two sides reach out toward each other this time, the thrust is more diffuse, and both are warier of arms limitations.    Diplomats on both sides intended the Geneva sessions as an unmistakable sign that after five years of saber-rattling and recriminations, the two superpowers are going to try to get along."

The Tokyo-based company said that it was negotiating for a plant site in Chattanooga, Tenn.   Analysts said Komatsu, which has about 7.5 percent of the American construction equipment market, is expected to build even more plants in the United States as the company tries to meet its goal of capturing 20 percent of the American market.    ''They're trying to convince dealers that they are making more of a commitment to the United States,'' said Andrew Silver, an analyst with the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. ''They want to show that they will be close to the market and will be ready to respond to it.''"
