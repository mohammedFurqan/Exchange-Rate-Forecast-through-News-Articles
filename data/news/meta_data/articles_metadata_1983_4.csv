Along with awe-inspiring walls and mighty towers with names like Peep- in-the-Kitchen, Stout Margaret or Tall Hermann, some 1,500 medieval buildings remain in the ancient heart of this capital of Estonia, one of the Soviet Union's 15 republics, or states.   A general restoration was completed in time for the 1980 Olympic Games, during which Tallinn served as host for sailing events. Since then this Baltic city has set about restoring each building to its original state, a project that may take generations."

If Gulf's management had not done such an effective job during the past few years in changing the company into a sleek concern with good operations and respectable earnings, Gulf would not be such an attractive target for Mr. Pickens.  Gulf Oil's management, led by James E. Lee, has adjusted its strategic planning, sold or shut down losing operations, trimmed the fat from ongoing operations, disposed of nonproductive assets and done a creditable job of getting new oil and gas production onstream. On this basis, Gulf shareholders have reason to be satisfied with Mr. Lee and company."

Officials in the foreign ministries of the larger European countries are considering what kind of pressure the Soviet Union might exert in a harder, more tense international climate and the range of potential Soviet actions once new NATO missiles are deployed in Europe. They are also considering possible Western responses.   The wide acceptance of the idea that the talks will be halted is essentially based on statements of Soviet officials who have insisted that the negotiations will be robbed of sense once the stationing of Pershing 2 and cruise missiles begins at the end of the year."

But they said Mr. Arafat, if he survived, was likely to be forced to move to Tunis or some other place far from the West Bank of the Jordan.   Once that happens, the officials said, it will raise the question of who is authorized to speak for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which Israel has controlled since 1967. American officials said it was too soon to know what would happen."

The report is the Government's definitive inquiry into the Oct. 23 terrorist attack that killed 241 American servicemen. The five-member commission, appointed by Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger last month, was charged with investigating the circumstances surrounding the attack and reporting its findings and opinions on the adequacy of security measures. The commission was headed by Adm. Robert L.J. Long, retired.   The report, submitted to Mr. Weinberger last week, was made public by the Defense Department with an indeterminate number of passages deleted for security reasons. The report said the policy of stepping up American military involvement in Lebanon endangered the marines' safety, and it also found intelligence inadequate. Its discussion of accountability, however, was of most immediate concern to Administration officials because the conclusions, they said, might raise questions about President Reagan's assertion that blame should rest with him."

Thus, the F.T.C. ended an investigation that had dragged on for 15 months. The final approval came only after the two big companies agreed to a consent decree that limits production to 200,000 subcompacts a year. Even so, the the five-man commission was split, with the three Reagan appointees pitted against the two appointed during the Carter Administration. ''A plain and unambiguous violation of the antitrust laws,'' said Michael Pertschuk, who was chairman of the F.T.C. under President Carter and voted against the Toyota-G.M. deal. The venture was also opposed by the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, which argued that because of their size, G.M. and Toyota could use their venture to dominate the subcompact market.

It is the stuff of which legends are made, especially in the personal computer software business.    Throughout the land, other young and ambitious entrepreneurs are toiling away late into the night struggling to write that next great piece of software - a set of instructions, usually embedded in a gray disk, that allows the nation's computers to perform useful tasks. These lone programmers working in their basements are also dreaming of creating the next Lotus.   But such visions may be unrealistic - for Mr. Kapor's accomplishment, dramatic as it may be, is no rags-to- riches success story. Mr. Kapor was amply backed by nearly $5 million in venture capital. To introduce its personal computer program, called simply ''1-2-3,'' Lotus spent more than $1 million in advertising in a three- month period - an unprecedented level for the industry."

General Kelley told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Defense Intelligence Agency had estimated that the truck that sped into the Marine headquarters in Beirut carried 5,000 pounds of explosives, not 2,000 pounds, as had been reported earlier.   At the same hearing, the commander of United States forces in Europe, Gen. Bernard W. Rogers, took responsibility for the security precautions arranged by the Marines in Beirut, since they are within his theater of operation.   ''I am responsible,'' General Rogers told the committee. ''Anything that happens or fails to happen in that theater is my responsibility.''"

''I believe in Lebanon,'' said Mr. Kassar, whose windows were blown out last Sunday when two bombs ripped through the compounds of the French and American forces.   ''I don't want to be a millionaire refugee in Paris or New York,'' he said.   For eight years of fighting in which more than 100,000 people have died, many Lebanese, like Mr. Kassar, have hung on.   But this week, many of his friends, especially the Christians, have begun finally to despair. The attacks on the multinational forces, in which around 230 Americans and 58 French soldiers were killed, have led many to conclude there is no hope of reconciliation in Lebanon. Even if the leaders of warring factions resolved their differences at the talks in Geneva, which are scheduled to open this week, any truce would only be temporary, said those who despair of a settlement."

In addition, the company was damaged by the new Government's austerity policies, which include drastic cutbacks in spending.

The Israeli and United States sources who take this view also say the presence of 5,000 to 7,000 Soviet soldiers in the country has strengthened Syria's defensive position.   Syria's present tactical deployments, intelligence officials said, make it virtually certain that any deep penetration of Syrian airspace by Israeli fighters and bombers would meet heavy antiaircraft fire, both from missiles and guns, that are largely manned by Soviet personnel. Only one of the four major surface-to-air missile bases in Syria is now said to be operated by Syrians."

The truck bomb that transited and exploded on the Battalion Landing Team (B.L.T.) headquarters building, with the loss of 240 lives, rolled through a concertina wire fence that was primarily a personnel barrier; it went between guard posts where the guards had their guns unloaded and had no opportunity to fire before the truck got past them; it went through a gate that was generally left open and was almost assuredly open that morning; iron pipes in front of the building were not large enough to stop the vehicle and had an opening the vehicle could drive through.

The Pope stopped just short of explicitly urging all military researchers to quit their jobs.

Speculators sold shares in order to raise cash to buy dollars in anticipation of a major devaluation of the Israeli shekel, which has not occurred.   While industrial shares were also heavily hit during the run, the banks propped up their shares by borrowing tens of millions of dollars abroad. But toward the end of the week, the banks indicated they could not keep it up and asked the Government to help."

Consumers will not be able to buy the long anticipated computer, called the PCjr (pronounced PC Junior), until early next year and it will be in limited supply even then, the company said. The delay is expected to slow holiday season computer sales in general because many consumers, already confused by a rapidly changing market, may delay their purchases until they can see and test the PCjr.   The home computer industry has been characterized by severe price cutting, which helped lead to last week's announcement by the Texas Instruments Corporation that it was quitting the business. There is also a growing disenchantment among consumers who are finding that the machines, many of which carry base prices of $200 and less, can do little more than play games."

HUMPHREY, whose father, Champ Humphrey, was once chairman of Gardner Advertising, St. Louis, is the new president of the New York office of Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson and the chief operating officer of the whole organization.   In the year and a half since he joined the agency, Stephen Humphrey, who is 41 years old, has been executive vice president and director of account services. Like Thomas E. Lawson, the president and chief executive, he came from Ogilvy & Mather. And he has something else in common with the boss: both their wives are executives on the account side at Kenyon & Eckhardt. They are Nina Lawson and Mary Lou Humphrey."

President Chun Doo Hwan, who apparently escaped harm only because a traffic delay kept him from the scene of the explosion, said upon his return to Seoul this morning that the incident was a ''carefully premeditated plot against the life of your President.''   'Not Talking From Evidence'    However, Government officials acknowledged they had no evidence that North Korea was behind the bombing, in which 47 people were wounded, many of them seriously. A principal Government spokesman, Choi Tae Soon, said, ''We are not talking from evidence but from the past record of the North Korean conspiracy.''"

There is, for instance, the ''Kenya cowboy,'' a roguish, raffish figure set against a backdrop of sunlit safaris, pink gins and polo, and possibly dubious deals in an East African playground, whose roots might be traced to the minority of white settlers in the 1930's.   Then there is the ''two-year wonder.'' The label is affixed by settlers of long standing to fellow whites of briefer tenure in a continent of adoption - technicians or businessmen who come to Africa on a contract and amass a little wealth to warm their fortunes back home, usually in Western Europe, Britain in particular. The two-year wonder is a figure of some derision, without the faded glamor of the Kenya cowboy."

Chrysler officials have high hopes for both the new product and the new facility, which cost $660 million. With a new production system that reduces inventory in the plant, they expect an increase in efficiency that will help pay for the $1 billion labor contract recently signed with the United Automobile Workers Union.   The vans, to be marketed as the Plymouth Voyager and the Dodge Caravan, are intended to woo buyers away from conventional station wagons and larger vans."

The embassy bombing, and at least seven other serious car bombings this year in Beirut, gave warning of a common tactic. But a determined terrorist overwhelmed the new airport defenses, raising questions about why the security measures were inadequate.    Larry Speakes, the chief White House spokesman, said tonight that President Reagan had ordered the Marine Commandant, Gen. P. X. Kelly, to go to Beirut to determine what security measures could be taken to improve protection for the marines in Lebanon.    'Unbelievable,' Kennedy Says    Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a member of the Armed Services Commitee, asked for an investitation by the committee into what he called the ''unbelievable breakdown in security that allowed it to happen.''"

President Hurtado, a 44-year-old former economics professor, conceded in an interview Friday that Ecuador, which has a foreign debt of more than $6 billion, was far from solving its payments problems.   He said that with a combination of austerity measures undertaken two years ago and increased petroleum production that ''we have been able to resolve our immediate problems'' and that Ecuador was headed toward eventual economic recovery."

A senior official of the Baghdad Government said recently that Iraq had already fired Soviet-made surface-to-surface missiles at Kharg Island, the Iranian oil terminal at the head of the gulf, and neutral military analysts believe that there will be further attacks from missile sites in Iraq.   The type of missile supplied by the Soviet Union to Iraq, known as SCUD B in the West, has a range of 187 miles and is capable of hitting Kharg Island and other targets in Iran from sites deep in Iraq. Recently these missiles have hit cities 125 miles into Iran. However the SCUD B, which can carry either a nuclear or a non-nuclear warhead, is not an accurate missile and informed opinion in London is that the Iraqis might fire as many as 10 without hitting the Kharg Island terminal."

In Washington, the Marine Corps Commandant, Gen. Paul X. Kelley, said he was ''optimistic'' that the Marine unit could be withdrawn early next year. But a Marine spokesman and Government officials said no decisions had been made. (Page A14.)"

Earlier this week, the General Motors Corporation reported a profit of $737 million and the Chrysler Corporation reported one of $100 million.

Nobody knows, even as the heating season gets under way, whether there will be more deregulation or just the opposite, what some are calling reregulation.   The Senate will have before it this month a bill reported without recommendation - that is, without enthusiasm - by an 11-9 vote of the Energy Committee. The main provision is a decontrol device under which gas selling above the presumed free-market price of about $2.90 per thousand cubic feet would be ''ramped'' down over a 12- month period, while gas selling below $2.90 would be ''ramped'' up over 36 months. In the end there would be deregulation that includes ''old,'' or pre- 1977, gas."

Today, with Socialists in power everywhere in southern Europe, there are no more great symbolic intellectuals of the left, offering their transcendental reputations, both as artists and militants, to a political cause. Not only are the resounding names gone, but many intellectuals feel that caution, for the most part, has replaced passion and involvement as the theme dominating the relationship between intellectual life and the Socialist experience of the five countries.  A series of interviews and conversations in the three central countries of the group, France, Spain and Italy, often found intellectuals split between their own definitions of themselves as ''people of the left,'' and their notions of how their Governments should perform.   A Badge of Legitimacy   The Governments from Portugal to Greece spend more money on culture, talk more about it, and insist they care more deeply about culture than any of their non-Socialist predecessors. For each of them, the approval of intellectuals and the Government's involvement in cultural affairs seem to be unusually important elements in establishing their legitimacy, shaping public opinion, and sinking Socialist roots."

It said the New Mexico utility operations account for 60 percent of its utility assets and $350 million of its total annual revenues of $1.10 billion, but have been only marginally profitable."

Yesterday's acts of terrorism in Beirut, which killed so many young American and French servicemen, were a horrifying reminder of the type of enemy that we face in many critical areas of the world today - vicious, cowardly and ruthless.   Words can never convey the depth of compassion that we feel for those brave men and for their loved ones.   Many Americans are wondering why we must keep our forces in Lebanon."

Rather, I.B.M., their favorite growth stock, is back.    The stock of International Business Machines has nearly tripled in price since late 1981. And, this year alone, it has advanced 40 percent, compared with a 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average, of which I.B.M. is a significant part. On Oct. 10, the stock hit a record high of $134.25 a share. Not since the late 1960's and early 1970's has I.B.M. been on such a roll."

Prices in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey area also rose by just four-tenths of 1 percent. (Page D2.)    With the moderate October increase, inflation nationwide so far this year is running at a 3.9 percent annual rate. That matches the increase in all of 1982, a recession year that saw the slowest pace of price increases since the 3.4 percent registered in 1972, when price controls were in effect. In 1981, prices rose 8.9 percent; in 1980, they increased 12.4 percent."

They are charged with high treason, an offense that carries a possible death sentence.    The hearings in the Rand Supreme Court have provided a rare glimpse into the world of South Africa's secret police and its operations against foes of apartheid.    Moreover, the disclosures at the trial seemed designed to create suspicion and mistrust among South African dissidents because they have highlighted the authorities' ability to undermine the nationalist movement by planting spies and informers in its ranks."

Vartan Trust Concern Looks Abroad,"  T HE Bessemer Trust Company, which manages $3.3 billion for wealthy individuals and   60 pension funds and foundations, is cutting back its holdings of United States equities while increasing commitments in foreign stocks.   ''We are less certain today of the sure opportunities of making money for our clients in the United States stock market, so we are also raising some cash reserves,'' said John R. Whitmore, president and chief executive officer. As a result, slightly less than half of all assets under management will remain in a core portfolio of American stocks, while the allocation to overseas issues will almost double, reaching 15 percent of total assets.   ''There are two key reasons for this decision,'' Mr. Whitmore said. ''First, we believe that European economies and markets that have lagged behind the United States, along with those in the Pacific Basin, now look attractive. Second, we expect foreign currencies to improve against the dollar as the economies abroad pick up.''"

The police said the shelling here today was the lightest since dawn Thursday, when the attack on positions held by supporters of Mr. Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, began.    The city officials formed a committee to try to negotiate a cease-fire and sent a message to Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, urging him to help end the fighting. Mr. Arafat has been contending that without strong support from Syria it would have been impossible for rebel Palestinians to begin their attack against his last remaining strongholds just north of here.   Meeting With Rebel Chief Sought    The officials said they hoped to have a similar meeting with Col. Saeed Musa, the leader of the rebel group opposing Mr. Arafat.   (In Washington, Reagan Administration officials said the crisis in the P.L.O. could provide an opportunity for renewing efforts to bring King Hussein of Jordan and West Bank Palestinians into negotiations with Israel.

She still cannot make the new machine do everything the old one did.   Hod Caulkins, an investment officer in White Plains, has been translating computer programs since July so that they can run on his new computer, also an I.B.M. ''Its a royal pain in the neck,'' he complains.    Mrs. Lassberg and Mr. Caulkins are both struggling with perhaps the single most important change in personal computers this year: the rapid emergence of the International Business Machines Personal Computer as an industry standard.   While few doubt that over the long run ''I.B.M. compatibility'' will make it much easier to use personal computers, hundreds of companies and thousands of office workers are discovering that abandoning their first desktop computers - either voluntarily or because of a company mandate - can be a technical nightmare.    Different Languages Used    The chief problem is that nearly every brand of personal computer sold before 1982 used a different language. While the Apples, Commodores and Radio Shacks that seeped into offices across the country increased productivity, they also stored letters and notes, statistics and financial statements in their own unique code. That meant information stored on a memory disk in Apple code could not be used in a Commodore, which had a code of its own."

FIGHTING BUT DOUBTS ARISE,"   The Foreign Ministers of Syria and Saudi Arabia announced today that rival Palestinian factions had agreed to stop fighting here and withdraw from the area within two weeks. But the Palestinians later cast doubt on whether the agreement would be put into effect.   At a news conference here, Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the forces opposing him had sent in reinforcements overnight and that ''we expect tomorrow they will try another big attempt.'' Saturday is the day that rebels in the P.L.O. have threatened to begin fighting Mr. Arafat in the streets of Tripoli.   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, Col. Abu Khaled al-Omlah, the chief of staff of the rebels, indicated that his faction was unwilling to comply with a provision of the agreement that requires the withdrawal of all Palestinian guerrillas from Tripoli and its environs.   'We Will Never Leave'    ''We will never leave these camps,'' Colonel Omlah said of the Beddawi and Nahr al Bared refugee settlements near Tripoli. ''They are our camps. We are the only ones who can insure the protection of our people in these camps.'' At his news conference, Mr. Arafat seemed not to have seen the full text of the agreement, which was announced in Damascus, and possibly had not given his final endorsement."

The Government of President Raul Alfonsin, which inherited a $40 billion foreign debt when it took over five days ago, asked a steering committee that represents more than 300 international banks to defer until June 30 the refinancing of nearly $9 billion in debt that was due today.   In meetings with bank representatives here and in a telex to the 12- member steering committee in New York, Economics Minister Bernardo Grinspun also asked to put off the payment of nearly $3.5 billion in both overdue interest and new interest that will be due by then.

They said in interviews that the committee would likely recommend that Argentina's creditors put off the refinancing that was due today but not put off all the interest payments.  ''The new Government is being responsible and realistic,'' said one of the representatives. ''It's clear they cannot pay all the interest, but we can't waive it all for six months.''"

Hollie Klein's Bid for Puritan,"  FOLLOWING the death last summer of Carl Rosen, the chairman of the Puritan Fashions Corporation, Puritan's stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose to a high of 26 7/8 on rumors of a takeover. Last Friday it reached a low of 12 1/4, after the company reported a 60 percent drop in third-quarter earnings.    This week a takeover offer came from Calvin Klein, the fashion designer, and the stock climbed to 16 7/8. Mr. Klein offered $16.50 a share for Puritan, a maker of Calvin Klein jeans, which amounted to a premium of about 35 percent on the market price the day of the offer, and was 65 percent over the book value of the shares.   Several factors have made Puritan particularly susceptible to these wide stock swings. It is still a family-run company, with Mr. Rosen's 27-year- old son, Andrew, as president; Puritan depends on one customer, and that customer, Calvin Klein, is operating in a weak jeans market and an even weaker designer jeans segment."

J. Maidenberg Taxing Futures Options,"  EVER since trading in options based on futures contracts resumed on Oct. 1, 1982, after a hiatus of 40 years, investors, their accountants and the Internal Revenue Service have faced an unusual problem: how should the profits on these options be treated?   Confusion has reigned, with the I.R.S. offering no guidelines. For its part, the options and futures industry has strongly urged that profits on options be treated the same way as gains on futures have been since June 1981 - 60 percent as long term and 40 percent as short term, which works out to a maximum tax bite of 32 percent. Unlike the securities markets, no tax holding periods are involved in futures trading."

The article states that ''. . . department stores generally operate at a 50 percent markup over wholesale prices.'' This is not true. Department stores usually try to operate at a 100 percent markup over wholesale prices. This gives them a 50 percent gross profit on sales. It also said that ''. . . traditional stores . . . have started promoting merchandise at reduced prices - with markdowns sometimes as high as 50 percent.''

While this somewhat brighter outlook is generally shared by American bankers, many in Europe remain deeply skeptical that the third world's liquidity needs will be met.

There are 385,100 jeepneys, or minibuses, whizzing around Philippine cities and towns, large numbers of them with more than one driver taking turns behind the wheel.   Jeepneys take their name from the military vehicle that was converted by enterprising Filipinos at the end of World War II to transport six people in the back, but the latest models are specially manufactured and much larger, with room for 12 to 18.   What is more, jeepneys are probably the most imaginatively decorated public conveyance in the world."

They said they hoped to create such a bond now to take advantage of what they regard as a growing convergence of American interests with Israel's.    By coincidence, Under Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger was in Israel winding up a mission aimed at reducing the misunderstandings and distrust of the last two years when the terrorist explosion occurred at an Israeli compound in Tyre. A goal of his trip was to persuade the new Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, to make an early trip to Washington for discussions on how the two countries can collaborate in these tense times in Lebanon and the Middle East.   A Major Shift for U.S.     This represents a major shift in American thinking about Lebanon, a shift caused both by the diplomatic stalemate over the country's future and a major buildup of Syrian forces. Ever since Israel pulled its troops back from the Shuf Mountains against the advice of the American and Lebanese Governments in early September, the Administration has feared that the Syrians may be under the impression that they can force Israel and the United States out of Lebanon without making any concessions themselves."

The number of men in these irregular forces engaged in operations varies from day to day, these sources said. There are, however, two constants. Between 6,000 and 7,000 Syrians serve with the guerrillas as officers, noncommissioned officers and technicians. In addition the Pentagon estimates that 100 Soviet officers tour the area of operations each day to check on troop dispositions, training and the use and maintenance of Russian weapons supplied to the guerrillas by Syria. Those Soviet officers disappear at sundown, the Pentagon sources say.   The basic weakness of the irregular forces is the absence of an effective command and control structure. A band may decide on an operation and carry it out without telling other groups or the Syrian high command. The Syrian influence was described as pervasive, but it is clear, these sources said, that the Syrians do not have operational control of all their clients."

The term RDX is more common in the United States, he said, adding that it is primarily a military explosive with a few specialty applications in the oil industry.   RDX was developed in World War II and is one of the most powerful conventional explosives. A white powder in its pure form, it is more effective than TNT and contains almost the theoretical limit of stored energy for a chemical of its type."

A NATO officer notes that the British have been fighting Irish Republican Army terrorism in Northern Ireland for years and that the French have recently encountered terrorism in Corsica.   President Reagan on Tuesday and the Long Commission report issued yesterday by the Pentagon both said terrorism posed a new military problem for which, in Mr. Reagan's words, the services are ''inadequately equipped.''

As the Democrat from the Oak Cliffs section of Dallas recalls it, a meeting with the Mayor of Dallas, a call from Gov. Mark White of Texas, a fellow Democrat, and entreaties from the supporters of the new Dallas Mass Transit Authority, all conveyed adamant opposition to curbing these tax-exempt, low-interest bonds.   This type of lobbying, repeated across the country by supporters ranging from local governments to underwriters, has now effectively stalled a measure to slow the proliferation of these bonds.

The document appears to outline an attempt to respond to growing criticism of Nicaragua in particular from some West European members of the Socialist organization.   According to the document, a meeting was held in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, on Jan. 6 and 7 to consider ''the balance of forces'' in the Socialist International and to propose ''initiatives to be taken to strengthen the position of progressive forces of Latin America and the Caribbean.''   The meeting was presided over by a member of Nicaragua's ruling Sandinista party and included representatives of the National Revolutionary Movement of El Salvador, the People's National Party of Jamaica, the Radical Party of Chile, the New Jewel Movement of Grenada and the Communist Party of Cuba, the document says."

To attain that goal, Detroit will have to overcome resistance to turbocharging that developed during the late 1970's, when the few domestic turbo models on the market proved to be unreliable and difficult.

The Palo Alto Brewery, which is really based in nearby Mountain View, is the latest of the ''micro- breweries'' that have sprung up over the past few years to produce a few thousand barrels of specialized beers each year for limited distribution.   Most have been founded out of simple love of the brew, and a thirst by connoisseurs for an alternative to what many say is the bland nature of popular American beers.   The West Coast has been especially active in spawning micro-breweries, likely inspired by the granddaddy of small California brewers - San Francisco's Anchor Steam Brewery, which produces 28,500 barrels a year. By comparison, the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the beer industry's largest, annually produces a bit more than 54 million barrels."

Journalists, many sent recently to Bridgetown, Barbados, 150 miles from Grenada, have been unable to get firsthand confirmation of information on such matters as the extent of casualties in the invasion or the situation of United States students and tourists caught in the upheaval.   Virtually all Western reporters were expelled from Grenada more than a week ago, when the Government of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was overthrown. No reporters were allowed to accompany the invasion force of United States Marines and troops from half a dozen other Caribbean countries - so the major stories were written by reporters in Washington, based on information given to them by State Department and other Government sources."

For his part, the Druse chieftain, Walid Jumblat, went out of his way to emphasize that his decision to set up a local administration, announced Saturday, was taken to provide basic public services to people living in the war- shattered areas under his control. He also emphasized he would welcome any help the central Government could provide. This move, he added, was not meant to be a prelude to the establishment of a Druse ''ministate.''   'Conscientious Objectors'    But Mr. Jumblat raised some suspicions about his ultimate intentions in the minds of senior Government officials today when he visited several hundred Druse soldiers who had gone to Hammana, a Syrian-occupied town some 18 miles east of Beirut. The soldiers there are acting as ''conscientious objectors,'' refusing to take part in any attempt by the Lebanese Army to use force to impose its authority over Druse-controlled areas."

Congress asserted in the legislation, which Mr. Reagan signed Oct. 12, that any substantial expansion in the number or role of United States armed forces in Lebanon would require a new approval from Congress. Mr. Reagan had earlier said that ''it would be my intention'' to comply with the requirement.   Although the Administration said today that it had no plans to expand the marines' role or withdraw them, Mr. Reagan has in the past carefully hedged his commitment to abide by Congressional limitations on his use of armed forces abroad.   He insisted obliquely in his Oct. 12 statement that he had the power to keep the marines in Lebanon even without Congressional approval. He hinted that the central provision of the War Powers Act of 1973 - requiring the President to ''terminate'' the use of armed forces in ''hostilities'' abroad in 90 days unless Congress authorized longer involvement - was unconstitutional."

Eleven years ago, the club's study, ''The Limits to Growth,'' cast a chill over the buoyantly producing, reproducing and consuming world by predicting that mankind faced catastrophe within a century unless it acted quickly to establish an equilibrium in which population growth, industrialization and the depletion of resources were halted.   Since publication of the report, which was prepared by an international research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the club has sponsored a continuing series of more limited studies and international conferences that have elaborated on the same theme.   Mr. Peccei recently returned to his elegant Rome apartment from a conference in Budapest devoted to the discouraging question of how by the end of ths century the world will manage to feed six billion mouths.

Mr. Wu's long-planned three-day trip came as the Administration grew concerned about a possible rise in tension in northeastern Asia after the explosion in Rangoon on Sunday that killed some South Korean officials and that President Chun Doo Hwan of South Korea said was meant for him.   The subject of possible arms sales was discussed at length during Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger's recent visit to Peking. Washington is seeking a closer strategic relationship with China."

Barring an unusually cold winter, the excess supplies should mean lower prices for heating oil and gasoline.   The oil surplus, coming seven months after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its crude prices to stimulate demand, has also led to mounting conjecture that OPEC may lower its prices again in December.   On Friday, in one of several indications of the excess of supplies worldwide, the Soviet Union said it was cutting the price of crude oil it exports by 50 cents a barrel, to $29. On the same day the Sun Company, a large United States producer, said it was lowering its wholesale price of heating oil by a cent a gallon, to 82.5 cents. Analysts said they expected other oil companies to reduce wholesale prices this week."

This is an attempt to answer some of them.   Q. Why were the Marines sent to   Lebanon in the first place?    A. In August 1982, after Israel's invasion of Lebanon and encirclement of Beirut, the special American envoy, Philip C. Habib, worked out an arrangement to permit the Palestine Liberation Organization and Syrian forces in Beirut to be withdrawn. To insure their safety from Israeli attack, the United States, France and Italy sent detachments of about 800 men each to Beirut. The three-nation force remained in Beirut from Aug. 25 to Sept. 10."

The importance of such selective assassinations has often been overlooked in the heated debate over human rights in El Salvador, which has concentrated on the rate of killing rather than the identities of those killed and the political motivation of the killers.   But as one United States official said of the death-squad assassinations, ''This is an effort to destroy the political center in El Salvador that United States policy has sought to nurture and protect for the last four years.''   In recent weeks, United States officials in El Salvador and Washington have issued statements deploring the death squads' activities and warning that failure by the Government to curb them could lead to a Congressional cutoff of American aid. They also assailed what they said were links between the death squads and the Salvadoran military. The statements appeared to represent a shift from an earlier, stated Reagan Administration policy of dealing with human rights abuses through what was called called quiet, behind- the-scenes diplomacy rather than publicly applied pressure."

At home, the white minority is warned it is facing an ''onslaught'' that is likely to make urban terrorism and rural insurgency a permanent part of its experience.   Abroad, South Africa writes off the Congress movement - which was banned 23 years ago, after nearly half a century of futile nonviolent protest - as ''a small clique of blacks and whites,'' as Prime Minister P. W. Botha put it in an interview, that is ''controlled by the Kremlin.''  A Contradictory Reality    The contradictory perceptions distort a contradictory reality. From a military standpoint, the African National Congress has been one of the world's least successful ''liberation movements.'' After more than two decades of armed struggle, it is still restricted to infiltrating across South Africa's borders in tiny bands - two, threes and fives - and recruiting on a small scale, to limit the number of police spies it takes into its ranks.  But its desultory bombing campaign, which averages one incident every two weeks, has as much to do with its pre- eminent status among black nationalist movements in the country as a history that goes back 71 years - two years before the founding of the National Party, which now governs South Africa, and five years before the Bolshevik Revolution."

Much of the discussion of the    A.T.& T. divestiture suggests   that it will create many problems. Does breaking up the company really make sense?     A. It is probably fair to say that none of the parties to the antitrust suit envisioned the outcome quite the way that it has turned out.    The divestiture plan that finally resulted has been criticized on many counts. Some other plan could undoubtedly have been devised, but no plan would have pleased everyone. To some, no change would seem a more attractive alternative than the current plan. But it is unlikely that the Bell System would have remained in place forever. Increased competition and other changes were beginning to occur even before the breakup was agreed upon."

The United States believes the Soviet Union may have violated provisions of the 1972 treaty limiting antiballistic missile defenses by building a huge new radar installation in Siberia and the 1979 treaty limiting strategic nuclear arms by testing more than one new intercontinental missile. The 1979 treaty has not been ratified but both sides have agreed to abide by its terms.   American officials are also concerned about encryption of electronic data broadcast from Soviet missiles during test flights. Such coding is forbidden if it would impede treaty verification.

Sales in the general metropolitan area, which includes results from the retailers' stores in the city and the suburbs, rose 7 percent.

But the relatively warm weather has not yet created the proper environment for such buying, retailers said."

During a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, questions arose over whether tooling purchases were properly classified as capital expenditures.    U.S. Surgical's presdient, Leon C. Hirsch, said that the company had appointed Touche Ross & Company as its new independent auditor and that an investigation of the tooling purchases is under way. U.S. Surgical, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., and makes surgical stapling instruments, was the second-biggest percentage loser yesterday in over-the-counter trading, plunging $5.625, to $14.375."

The crisis in South Africa's black schools has been simmering since the 1976 riots in Soweto, Johannesburg's sprawling black ghetto. Schools for blacks are generally held to be overcrowded, teachers are often poorly trained and there is a high dropout rate. There are also far fewer educational aids in schools for blacks than there are in schools for whites."

But a significant minority rejects such optimism for the year ahead.   One of these is Milton Friedman, the monetarist, who has argued for some time that strong money-supply growth during the first half of this year has already made a new surge of inflation inevitable.  Now he's joined by Geoffrey H. Moore, director of the Columbia Business School's Center for International Business Cycle Research. Mr.  Moore's new index designed to foretell inflation is flashing a warning.

The decision signals a reluctance to put further bars on trade with the Russians, and helps the United States avoid new trade frictions, such as those arising from last year's sanctions against selling equipment for construction of the natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe.   Currently, the Administration restricts the sale of most high-technology equipment to the Soviet Union. But the Administration has permitted the sale of some pipeline construction equipment, such as conventional drilling rigs, that involve less advanced technology. Most recently, equipment to help lay pipelines has been removed from the restricted list."

The labor unrest, it is widely agreed, has its roots in one of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's most important initiatives: her effort to limit trade-union power. It has therefore become a legal, industrial and political test case, with implications extending far beyond Fleet Street.    One of the biggest factors in Mrs. Thatcher's victory in May 1979 was popular resentment over strikes by public employees in the preceding months - strikes that led to crises in some hospitals and to the appearance of mounds of uncollected trash and garbage in the streets. The failure of the Labor Party under James Callaghan, who was then Prime Minister, to avoid what was called the winter of discontent gave Mrs. Thatcher's promises of changes in the trade-union movement wide appeal."

A commission spokesman, Herbert Hetu, said that while no final recommendations had been drafted, the group was expected to propose a large new aid program for Central America in its report to President Reagan early in January. Other commission officials said the aid package could total several billion dollars over 5 to 10 years.   These officials, speaking on condition that they not be identified, said several Democrats on the 12-member commission had asserted that American aid to El Salvador should be linked to a halt in right-wing death squads. But they said that former Secretary of State Kissinger, among others, had argued that since El Salvador was of vital interest to the United States, aid should not be made conditional."

That leading edge turned out to be ''flexible manufacturing,'' a technology born a decade ago that is finally beginning to transform the factory floors of some of the nation's largest companies. It's a marriage of robots and computers that might have allowed Henry Ford to turn out Model T's and Model A's almost simultaneously on the same assembly line.   At Deere, the mix includes 10 different models of tractor transmissions and 5,000 configurations of tractors. ''We ended up with features in there we never even dreamed of at the start,'' said Robert W. Boeke, a senior vice president at Deere. ''We didn't realize then that you could tie the different computers in the plant together and drive the whole thing.''"

Widespread fear that the Government would institute a 50 percent devaluation of the Israeli shekel had created panic buying of dollars and dumping of the usually stable bank stocks on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The Government reacted swiftly. It shut down the exchange, halted all foreign currency trading and a day later devalued the shekel by 23 percent. It also cut subsidies on basic foodstuffs in half and promised to support the value of the bank shares. Such austerity measures were cheered by some and scorned by others. Israelis flooded stores, buying up goods before the devaluation took effect, and many called for the resignation of Finance Minister Yoram Aridor, whose economic policies have been under attack for months. Late in the week, Mr. Aridor did indeed resign after the Shamir Cabinet rejected his plan to replace the shekel with the dollar as the currency for salaries, budgets and prices."

Over the objections of opposition parties, the governing Liberal Party of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau will give final reading to a bill raising the current average rate that the nation's railroads may charge to ship a ton of grain to market to $25, from the current $4.89.   Under the current rate schedule, CP Rail, a unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. and the nation's biggest railroad, has lost more than $1.2 billion (Canadian) on grain hauling since 1970 alone - $200 million of which came last year.

He said that the business traveler is a repeat customer. ''While the leisure and business markets are roughly equal at 49 percent and 51 percent of the total airline traffic respectively, only 36 percent of passengers account for that 51 percent of business travel.

The unknown investors, purchasing through Swiss banks, made over $6 million in a few days. Insider trading was charged, but for two years this litigation has stalled while the S.E.C. attempts to identify the purchasers whose names are shielded by Swiss secrecy laws.   This is but one example where foreign secrecy and blocking laws have impeded the S.E.C.'s efforts to police the internationalized United States securities markets. And the problem is not unique to the S.E.C. It affects a host of Federal agencies and occurs in cases involving antitrust violations, tax fraud - such as is alleged in the Marc Rich case - and private civil litigation.  This is no small problem. The dollar and the integrity of our capital markets stand at the center of world economic order. Stock and bond purchases in the United States by foreign persons or institutions have more than doubled in four years, to $53 billion in 1982. Our markets also are an important source of capital for foreigners. About 250 foreign issuers and 25 foreign governments have securities registered with the S.E.C."

Having promised as a candidate to balance the budget by 1983, President Reagan has gone over onto the defensive of late and has been playing down the economic significance of the budget deficit.   At the end of the fiscal year at the close of business today, spending exceeded revenues by nearly $200 billion, nearly twice the 1982 deficit of $110.7 billion, the previous high.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, without new spending cuts and tax rises, the deficit could stay up around $200 billion for years to come, a prospect widely regarded as dangerous to the country's economic well-being."

State-sponsored terrorism, they say, is exploiting an anti-American atmosphere in the Middle East and the willingness of some activists to commit suicide for a cause, and has become a potent form of political violence that is extraordinarily difficult to prevent or root out.  Although the hard evidence is fragmentary - because of the professionalism of the operations and the ease with which plotters can disappear across Lebanon's open borders - the overwhelming opinion among diplomatic and security sources in the Middle East is that the Governments of Syria and Iran are ultimately involved in some way. They said both Syria and Iran had the resources and ample political motives for supporting these attacks as an adjunct to their foreign policies in the region.  Bombing of Marine Compound   When Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger declared that the bombing of the Marine compound in Beirut on Oct. 23 was carried out with the ''sponsorship, knowledge and authority of the Syrian Government,'' he was only giving public voice to what Western diplomats and Arab officials had been saying privately."

The unusual announcement from the Soviet press agency Tass of the extreme measure taken against Yuri K. Sokolov, and of long prison terms handed down to four of his associates, was viewed as a strong signal that Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader, intends to pursue his year-old crackdown on corruption in high places.   Mr. Sokolov had been director of Gastronom No. 1, an ornately decorated store on Gorky Street that is popularly known as Yeliseyevsky's because it occupies the premises of a celebrated prerevolutionary delicatessen of that name.   Mr. Sokolov was famed in Moscow as supplier of scarce delicacies to well- placed and well-heeled Muscovites, and his regular customers reportedly included Galina Churbanov, the daughter of the late Leonid I. Brezhnev and wife of Yuri M. Churbanov, a former First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, who has reportedly been demoted to a relatively minor post in Murmansk."

Indeed, the Arab Governments seem to have little else to agree upon these days, given the sharp rifts over the situation in Lebanon and the Iranian-Iraqi war.   Even Washington's closest friends in this part of the world, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Tunisia and Morocco, have been expressing their discontent over the enhanced ''strategic cooperation'' between the United States and Israel.   According to American diplomats here, the message from Washington's friends is similar in the various capitals: by dramatizing the connection with Israel, the United States is distracting attention from the flow of Soviet arms to Syria and from the Syrian-backed disruption in Lebanon, including the effort to crush Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization."

Teheran has played a major role, directly and indirectly, in encouraging Islamic fundamentalist forces in the region, Arab officials and Western diplomats say. Iranian militants have trained thousands of Shiite Moslems from Arab countries at a center near Qum and at other camps. Diatribes against Western nations and what Iranians call corrupt Arab governments are beamed daily to the Arab world by the Iran radio and distributed throughout the region on cassettes.   The example set by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolution and his rejection of non-Moslem ideologies have inspired not only Shiite Moslems but many Sunnis as well."

Many questioned why Mr. Duvalier, who is President-for-Life and is only 32 years old, would be thinking about succession.

If they wished, Mr. Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone could find plenty to talk about to make them mutually unhappy. Japan still does not spend enough on defense to satisfy many Americans, two-way trade is likely to produce a $23 billion deficit for the United States this year and continued high unemployment has left some Americans with the notion that the Japanese are responsible for many of their troubles.   There is grousing, too, on this side of the Pacific, mostly out of conviction that every time something goes wrong in the United States, Japan is made a scapegoat. The sense that this country tends to be picked on unfairly is sufficiently engrained for a new word to have cropped up in some circles here: ''goatability.'' It is used only partly in jest."

United States officers on the island have revised their estimates of the number of Cubans in Grenada, where earlier this week the total had been estimated at 1,000, including workers who before the invasion had been building an airstrip at Point Salines.  Yesterday the figure was put at 1,100, with more than 600 being held prisoner.    Three hundred or more were said to be in the hills near Pearls, the commercial port on the northeastern coast, and the rest in hills near the Point Salines airfield at the southwestern tip of the island.   A War of Harassment    Given adequate weapons and ammunition, the American military sources said, the Cubans could carry on a war of harassment based on the positions they are believed to hold in the hills that run from near the capital, St. George's, northeast of Point Salines to well beyond Pearls Airport."

About 500,000 extra passengers are expected to fly into the Los Angeles area during the Games.

Rangers are soldiers specially trained to fight in small groups and to undertake surprise raids in any terrain or weather.   Government officials said in press briefings today that about 700 Rangers and 1,200 marines of a Marine amphibious unit landed in the island. The officials said some of the Rangers parachuted into the Point Salines area near the southern end of the island. If so, this would be the first combat jump by United States airborne troops since the Vietnam War, when such jumps were a sparingly used tactic."

Mr. Kobak's presentation was made at the Southampton Princess for the three-day, 64th annual American Magazine Conference.   Although publishers must constantly be planning for new publications, Mr. Kobak said, statistically the prospects for them are rather bleak.

The unitary worldwide tax, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in June, allows states to take into account the worldwide profits of large corporations. Under California's law, the specific statute upheld by the Court, the state determines what percentage of a multinational concern's payroll, property and sales are within the state - and then taxes that percentage of the company's worldwide profits. California gets some $500 million in extra revenues because of the unitary tax method. Currently, a dozen states have a unitary worldwide tax system, and several others are considering one."

Adding the level of unemployment to the inflation rate, the director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company figured the index stood at 20.5 percent just before the 1980 elections that brought Ronald Reagan to Washington. Currently the index is hovering at 13.6 percent, and based on Mr. Wenglowski's forecast, it will creep up to only 14.5 percent by Election Day 1984 as inflation rises faster than unemployment drops.  ''These numbers say that Reagan makes it - things will be looking good for him on the economic front by Election Day,'' he said.    Such is the prevailing sentiment among a number of the nation's prominent economists, who were asked recently to gaze into their crystal balls for the 12 months until the Presidential election. Based on their current forecasts, the economy will treat Ronald Reagan well if he decides - as most observers think he will - to make a second run for the White House. Inflation, though moving up, will remain relatively subdued, they say, unemployment will continue its slow descent, the economy will continue to move ahead buoyantly and interest rates will trend downward."

Several senior officials and Soviet affairs experts in the Government said in recent interviews they were worried that the coincidence of the attack on the plane and the expected start of NATO's deployment of new American missiles in Western Europe in December might produce the most dramatic confrontation between Moscow and Washington since the Berlin and Cuban crises of the early 1960's.   Soviet Intentions Uncertain    However, the officials say they can only guess what the Soviet Union will do if, as expected, the negotiations in Geneva fail to produce an accord on limiting missiles and if the deployment of the 572 new missiles in West Germany, Britain and Italy begins on schedule.   Some senior officials, including President Reagan, seem persuaded that despite repeated Soviet threats of some kind of retaliation for the missile deployment, there will be no serious crisis."

By threatening plant closings and insolvency and by using new weapons such as going into bankruptcy court to reorganize, management has succeeded in driving union wage increases to their lowest level in years. Even the mightiest unions such as the steelworkers and auto workers have been put on the defensive by management's demands for concessions.    But labor, still reeling from large- scale layoffs, is starting to regroup and is increasing its resistance to givebacks.   ''Concessions used to be a rare and isolated event,'' said George M. Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ''If you asked what portion of settlements in any past year contained concessions, the answer would be zero or 3 percent. Last year and this year, however, about half the major contracts have contained concessions.''"
