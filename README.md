## Previous work:

This work builds on the past work:
http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2019spr/report/25.pdf

## New Work:

We are trying to estimate the exchange rates by introducing below enhancements:
- Collecting articles with more number of topics and thereby increased number of articles
- Multiple news sources
- Tuning the clustering process with LDA
- Considering more number of economic indicators
- Including data apart from mainstream media; such as Executive Presidential Orders
- Consider the possibilitiy of introducing more powerful models such as gradient boosting (XGBoost, LGB) and Neural Networks
